GRE,What is the standard GRE score for Stanford university?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-the-standard-GRE-score-for-Stanford-university,"Standord University, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions",10,"I must say that the answer of Rituparna Roy Chowdhury does not at all match what goes on in the graduate admissions process at Carnegie Mellon, in the School of Computer Science. I don’t have recent first-hand knowledge of the admissions process at MIT and Stanford, but I do know that their standards for admission are very similar to ours. It may be that Chowdhury’s answer is closer to the truth for less technical areas — I don’t know about that.Chowdhury is right that there is no hard cut-off for GRE scores. In terms of academic ability and preparation, we look at a number of factors, with high grades in CS courses at a good school being the most important. GREs, statements in the recommendation letters, and evidence from research projects that you have a solid and effective background in the field are useful as supporting evidence. And, while evidence of a solid base of CS knowledge is necessary for admission to a top CS program, it is not sufficient: the real deciding factor is what you have done to demonstrate the ability to do graduate-level research in your area of choice.These top schools are absolutely not looking for “average” or “ordinary” students. If that’s what we think you are, you won’t be admitted. A statement of purpose full of passion and promise and “out of the box” thinking will definitely not help you at all — especially if it looks like it was written with the help of a professional service — unless there is solid evidence of actual research activity and some accomplishment. Passion is cheap, easy to fake, and pretty useless without skill and research ability. We have far more really excellent applicants than we can accept, so there is no reason to seriously consider someone with only average ability. A candidate might have average grades and test scores, but if they do, they had better have some strong evidence that they actually know what they need to know, plus some really excellent research skills to make up for any deficit in knowledge and preparation.It is true that Edison had little formal schooling and didn’t do well in that area. (Contrary to popular myth, Einstein and Tesla did very well in school, at least in the math and physics studies that were challenging enough to engage them.) The world was very different in Edison’s day: electricity as a technology was very new, so there wasn’t so much that you could learn from books. Edison would certainly not be accepted into any top grad school today, or probably even into a good undergraduate program — that is, not until he had actually done something to show that he could do excellent research despite his lack of formal preparation.","Please do not fall for misleading information that admissions consultants are using to lure students into buying their professional services.Please remember, In addition to the high quality of education, research and facilities a top university provides, one of the most important things about a top ranked university vs a mediocre ranked university (I speak of rankings for the sake of this answer. I do understand that one can receive a very good education from a lower ranked school, that is not what I mean by mediocre.) is selectivity.Top schools are highly selective in choosing their faculty as well as their students. If ‘ordinary’ people could easily get in everywhere, what would be so special about the school anyway?There’s no major difference in top ranked schools and mediocre ranked schools in terms of curriculum or courses offered because they all have to meet the same criteria to be accredited anyway. The only time I’ve seen some one ‘ordinary’ accepted in a top school is if they applied for a program which the school is not really known for. To get an idea of this, look at the individual rankings of a department and course not only the overall ranking of the university. In that case also, the candidate still meets the criteria the school is looking for. So what has been mentioned in another answer is complete cr*p. You cannot “project” yourself better and get away with an average profile and then get accepted easily.","You can apply to Stanford even with a GRE score of 300 - past academics is not the main criterion here - what matters is how you project yourself.Recently, a 17-year old girl from Mumbai who is not even a matriculate got accepted at MIT. This was news recently, and you can check that out on the web.Remember, even average students can get accepted at top universities. This is because US universities believe even ordinary students can deliver extra-ordinary results, as also academic brilliance need not always translate into professional excellence.Yes, an average student can get into MIT or Stanford. Sounds strange, but possible! All you have to do is, project yourself as a passionate innovator who can bring about new solutions through your out of box thinking.US Universities look for an Einstein, Edison and Tesla inside you. Much more than your academic scores, they are eager to find out the hidden scientist inside you. So, explain in details, your past research projects and future areas of work where you see lot of opportunities.Remember, Edison had been to school for just three months in his lifetime. In middle school, Einstein was a very ordinary student. Thus, the ability to become a scientist depends much more on innovative thinking than on being a class topper. So, think out of box, and you may end up with a path-breaking discovery.So, what matters is not what you are, but how you project yourself before the admissions committee - your passion for the subject and drive for innovation matters the most.I am quoting some links below, which give excellent information on how to prepare your application with an extra-ordinary profile.How To Write Scholarship EssaysHow To Write Statement of Purpose New Delhi NCR Bangalore Pune Hyderabad Gurgaon Mumbai ChennaiStatement of Purpose, India",According to some educator its 330 or more to get admission in Stanford University.

GRE,"Apart from good GRE scores, what are the other credentials required to ensure admission to a top foreign university for an MS program?",https://www.quora.com//Apart-from-good-GRE-scores-what-are-the-other-credentials-required-to-ensure-admission-to-a-top-foreign-university-for-an-MS-program,"The GRE and Postgraduate University Admissions, Master's Programs and the Graduate Record Examination, Master's Programs Admissions, Master of Science in Computer Science, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Master of Science Degrees, Master's Programs, College and University Admissions, College Advice",41,"Note: You can follow my Quora blog for more info about higher education abroad: https://studyabroadgre.quora.com/SOP Evaluation here: SOP Evaluation procedure by Mihir on Study AbroadPS: Before I answer anything else, I will directly answer the question asked by most of the applicants: Can my GRE compensate for poor GPA/CGPA? The answer is NO. Now read everything below:GRE is not a big selection criterion for MS programs. The selection of a candidate for MS program is a 2 stage process:Screening process by the admin department: This screening process goes something like, there is a list of cut-off score or threshold values for certain selection criterion. For example, all students with GRE above 310 will be cleared, or all students with CGPA above 8.0/10.0 will be selected etc. This limit is not very strict and is flexible. TOEFL is one such criterion that will fall only and only in this screening process and not evaluated for the next one, unless you are going for TA/RA, in which case they need to evaluate your English language capability (still it will be least importance).Selection process by Adcom: In this process, you will be judged on your GPA, GRE score, SOP, LOR etc and is highly flexible. A student with great acads but not so good GRE can be selected over a student with perfect GRE score and average acads. It depends on your whole application file BUT certain parameters weigh more than the others.Usually the selection criterion goes like this (in descending order):Academic GPA/CGPA/%age as well as ranking in your batchUndergrad universitySOPResearch ex/Work exGRELORThese other factors will vary from case to case:Final Year ProjectInternship and papersCo/Extra-curricularProf LettingProblems people might face:BacklogsYear GapPlagiarismSome people may disagree, but this is what I personally think, seen and experienced.SELECTION CRITERION:1. Acads are the most important parameters:Your GPA or %age is the prime deciding factor. If you are topper in your batch and have shown outstanding academic performance, the chances are that you will be a preferable candidate for the program. Backlogs will damage your admission chances drastically. Although you can still find cases with a lot of backlogs and people still get admission in the university. Read this link at the end of the answer those who have low confidence in this area (he had 55 backlogs; read the whole thread/story).2. Undergrad University:If you belong to one of the top universities in your country, and you have descent acads, then you have good chances of admission. BEWARE, if you are from a top university BUT your acads are weak you will have a disadvantage compared to a student who is from a descent ranking university but high GPA. That's how it goes, 'Be on the top where ever you are', that's something to be learned not just for MS admission process but for life as well. :D3. Statement of Purpose (SOP):I personally feel that SOP is a big deciding factor in your admission. You can be a lot of different by writing an excellent SOP. Your SOP will say a lot of thing about you silently that a strong profile will never be able to speak out. SOP tells your attitude, your ambition, your clarity of thought and your personality. These sometime overweight excellent profiles. This video will help you realize the importance of a good SOP (UMass Amherst Admission Committee):Also if you want to read more about it, check the link at the end of the answer.4. Work/Research ex, GRE and LOR:I will prefer not to rank them in a strict order because they will depend on the type of program you are applying to. If you are applying for a research based program, your research/work ex and LOR will be of higher value than GRE, but if may be it is not a specifically research based MS program, then if is possible that GRE may matter more. A good GRE score will certainly help. Score above 310 is considered okay-okay.... may be descent... 320+ is desirable and good... 330+ is excellent. AWA also matters and 3.0+ is almost like mandatory... 4/4+ is good. Work/research ex is helpful not just during MS application process but also after completing your MS when job hunting. A relevant work ex is recommended and good, but if you have work ex in a different field than what you are going to study, no promises can be made if it will help.If you are interested in doing some research work and gain some research experience before applying for MS you can apply as RA at IITs under a prof. Here are some details on that: http://www.edulix.com/forum/show... LORs are important mainly for PhD programs. they do add some weight to the application, but only if a prominent professor from a premier institute or a high ranking official from work place writes it. It is also important to send the LOR only using the official university/company mail id of the prof/boss, else although acceptable, they will add ZERO points to application.Finally I will add the uncertainty factor: LUCK. :D Although they say ""The harder I work, the luckier I get.""Update: To include all the rest of the factors involved in the admission process.THESE FACTORS WILL VARY FROM CASE TO CASE:1. Final Year Project (FYP):Check this too: Mihir Gupta's answer to Which kind of project should I do so that I can show it in my resume for MS in US? This is also one of the important deciding factors for admission, especially for one applying for MS with thesis. It will demonstrate your ability to convert your theoretical know-how into practical engineering knowledge. Also if your project is good enough, you can get a paper out of it and publish it. Sometimes, if he admission process involves an interview with a prof who is willing to take you as RA/TA, then the FYP is very important as mos of the interview questions will be from the project.2. Internships and Papers:Internship that are usually undertaken by B.Tech students in 3rd or 4th year matter only if they project assigned to them is a good one and it they do it from a reputed firm like IISC, DRDO, or some big pvt companies. Here the important thing will also be to work for a longer time as one month's internship won't be of any use. If you work for a minimum 3 months and are also able to impress your boss such that he is willing to give you recommendation, that will be the best case scene. It is also possible to try score internships abroad in a university or a company. They are a big plus for overall profile.Research papers published during the final year project or internship will help those who wish to go for MS with thesis option but not very much for students aiming for MS without thesis (MEngg; 1 yr course). The impact factor of the journal you have published your work in will be considered, but not much as adcom do not expect a high quality research work from an undergrad unless it is a direct PhD application.3. Co/Extra-curricular:These activities will not offer you any major advantage, but will make your resume/CV look bright and show that you are involved in activities other than acads. If you do not have good acads and bad GRE, then these activities will be of zero importance, on the other hand if you profile is good and you have done some nice activities, then these will provide you an edge over student who has profile similar to yours.4. Prof-Letting:This is useful only when you think you have good admission chances and that you want to work under a prof as RA/TA under a prof during MS. For this the credentials responsible will differ. Of course acads will still hold importance, but after that will come your work ex, research ex, papers, project and LOR. There is a method required to contact profs of the desired university. You can read all about it in the link at the end of the answer.PROBLEMS PEOPLE MIGHT FACE:1. Backlogs:Don't feel disappointed if you have had a few backlogs. Although your list of universities will be a bit different compared to the one who had no backlogs, but you still do have a good chance to succeed. For this I will again link you to this guy who had 55 backlogs and still got admit and visa as well. All you need is strong motivation, hard work and will power.Backlog in a core subject, the one you are selecting your specialization for MS will hurt bad, but if it is in an unrelated subject, it will probably not be that bad.2. Year Gap:If you completed your UG in 2012 and did nothing till June 2013, then it will be called a year gap. If you worked for a major part of that year (6/6+ months) then its not probably not a year gap.Some year gaps are acceptable. Like you took a year off to work in an NGO or may be for (Teach For India) TFI or something like that, then it is acceptable.The other case may be that you were preparing for GATE or any other exam. This will be a negative factor for your profile unless you did great in that exam and that exam somehow added to your profile (like good GATE score is valuable for German universities).The third case can be that you were search for job and by the end you decided to take GRE for MS. This will have really bad effect on your profile, unless you can cover it with something valuable you might have done side by side.3. Plagiarism:This is kind of an indirect factor that may affect your chances of admit, BUT if found guilty, you may not just receive reject from the university you applied to but also from other universities you are going to apply to. Plagiarism is a serious issue when it comes to higher studies.

More importantly, once you achieve something around 167 and above in quant and 160 and above in Verbal, even GRE does not matter. These days a lot of Indian students are applying with GRE scores of 325+, so I do not think GRE will pull you up, unless you get 335+ (but anything less than 315 will pull you down).What matters --1) CGPA (higher the CGPA better are your chances. Anything with 9 pointer above will be a good bet).2) Rank (if your university of college gives you a recognised rank then say your CGPA is 8, but still you are second in class, then it shall help your case).3) Name of the institute. Better recongized is your institute, better are your chances. For example: names such as IIT, NIT or BITS do hold value.4) Internships -- If you have internship at IIT or some other good US university, then you have brighter chances of achieving an admission. If you have internships at top multinationals (such as for CS guys microsoft, IBM labs, intel, samsung and so on) then also you can secure a good MS program. Your internship at a startup can also help you, if the work done is good. The main point to understand is at the end of the day, work matters.5) If you have research papers or some academic awards or grants, then it will help you pass through a good MS program. Publishing researh papers does not mean that a person publishes 10 papers, but the conference or journal is not even recognized. Even if you have a single paper, but from a reputed organization, then it is far better than ten.6) Contacts with foreign univeristy profesor. If you have any interaction with the professor of the college of your choice, then you have an edge.7) SOP -- A golden rule, write the truth and not stories. State your achivements and your study plans, group to join and professor to work with.PS: Thanx to Nikhil Prabhu for edits","Dear GRE aspirant,Do you think that modest GRE scores and backlogs would hold back a profile? No, definitely not.To help you in understanding this claim better, I have a chart* with three GREedge alumni with modest GRE scores and backlogs.*Data obtained from GREedge’s Admission Counselling TeamSo, these profiles are indeed testimony to the fact that apart from your GRE score, a host of other factors determine the status of your admits. Now that you know this, I’m sure you are wondering what these factors are. Based on my experience as the Co-founder of GREedge, I would like to share them with you.Before you get to these factors, you must know the application process to know how universities shortlist candidates. This would give you a background of what universities look for in a prospective candidate. A general flow of the application process would look like this:Over the evaluation process, Universities, in general, look to scrutinize you on a holistic basis.The evaluation begins by examining your CGPA and a host of other factors. Some of these factors include the scores of your admission requirement tests, Letter of Recommendation, Statement of Purpose/essay among the rest. So, clearly understand what universities use as a sieve in screening your application.Most universities have some common filters. Some of them include:Competitive GPA: Once your application package reaches the university, it is immediately forwarded to the Graduate Department. The first scrutiny that is made on the application is the “test of your GPA”. Your GPA speaks volumes about your application. If you are a rank-holder or if you have a consistent academic track record, then you can definitely expect some weightage. Countries like the U.S. and Germany place a huge emphasis on GPAs. For example, Georgia Tech requires an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better to pursue a Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (MS-HCI). Though you cannot completely balance your profile with high GPA, a consistent and competitive GPA will definitely add substantial value to your profile. In addition to your GPA, the following academic factors will give your application an edge too.TOEFL/IELTS: A great deal of emphasis is placed on your IELTS or TOEFL score apart from your GRE score. Most universities require a good TOEFL or IELTS score. For example, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, requires a minimum of 90 points in the Internet-based TOEFL (iBT). Georgia Tech, on the other hand, for the MS-HCI program, requires a minimum of 100 in TOEFL. Universities emphasize on TOEFL/IELTS scores to determine the status of TA/RA. Further, IELTS and TOEFL scores are also taken into account in determining the quantum of your scholarships and fellowships. Keep it a point to research on the minimum requirements. A TOEFL score over 100 or IELTS score over 7 will indeed add value to your profile.Letter of Recommendation: The basic purpose of the Letter of Recommendation is to get a person to vouch for your credentials. This, no doubt, adds value to your profile. Ensure that you get two or three Letters of Recommendation. The Letter of Recommendation must come from someone who has been associated with you. It can be your university professor or your senior at workplace. Further, it will also add value if the person who recommends you has a PhD. So, make it a point to get a commendable Letter of Recommendation and this will indeed boost the value of your profile.Statement of Purpose: Your SOP is just like your personal interview with the Admission Committee. Convey all that you want the Admission Committee to know about your profile.Your Statement of Purpose must be genuine and convincing. Make it a point to highlight the drive behind your Master’s program. Answer all possible questions, such as:1. Your degree of interest in your chosen field 2. What made you apply for the particular university 3. Why did you choose the particular courseEnsure that you don’t leave out any relevant information. Make it a point to highlight all your academic achievements and professional goals. Always remember that your SOP is as good as an interview. So, draft a compelling SOP that would persuade the Admission Committee to consider your profile.You can keep the following guidelines in your mind while you draft your SOP:Paper Publication and Research Work: Having a good number of paper publications and research work will show that you had been in touch with the academic community. Ensure that you have your papers published in international journals. Also, if you had participated in international conferences, ensure that you highlight them. A good number of paper publications and research work will indeed add points to your applications. So, even if you have not published any papers until now, get started with it. Paper publications and research work add a high impact to your profile.Work Experience: Work experience will be a crucial factor in adding value to your profile. Two or three years of relevant experience will add precious points to your profile. Further, it will also be a good source for your Letter of Recommendation. Though work experience is not a mandatory requirement, relevant work experience in a reputed company will add value.Project and Internships: Your project and internships will definitely be considered while your application is evaluated. The degree of your practical knowledge and research acumen can be demonstrated through projects and internships. So, highlight your projects and internships. Make it a point to highlight your projects and internships in an appropriate manner.Apart from these factors, you can certainly highlight your co-curricular and extracurricular activities too. They will also be considered since they throw light on your overall personality.Though there is no set order of priority in evaluating a candidate’s profile, you can indeed make a huge impact if you can balance out your profile. So, have a balanced profile and try not to compromise on any element. Remember that universities look for candidates with a holistic profile and not someone with unilateral strength. This will indeed make all the difference.All the best!","Studying abroad: it’s something we all have dreamt about at some point, isn’t it? The prospect of moving to a strange country, meeting new friends and living independently cannot fail to excite anyone. It really comes as no surprise, then, that the Ministry of External Affairs reported that as many as 7.5 lakh Indian students are studying abroad in 2018, with the numbers only predicted to rise in the coming years.With the US and Canada retaining top spots as the preferred study abroad destinations, (with 2.1 lakh and 1 lakh Indian students respectively) it goes without saying, then, that the competition for seats at universities in these two countries can get incredibly stiff.eBook Download: USA or Canada - What’s the right choice for MSAdd to that the high costs of application fees, and it becomes paramount to ensure that your application quality is top-notch and helps you put your best foot forward. So how exactly can you do this, and guarantee for yourself an offer letter to your dream university? What are the various credentials that you need to focus on to build a stellar application package?GRE scores: Needless to say, a high GRE score is capable of working magic on your profile, and can both elevate the quality of a mediocre application, and further boost the worthiness of a quality profile. A high Verbal score proves your robust command over the English language and implicitly your ability to handle living and studying in an English-speaking country, while an excellent performance on the Quant section can unlock all kinds of rewarding scholarships and Teaching/Research assistantship positions.

However, there are several reputed schools even in Canada that require or accept GRE scores as a part of graduate applications. Here’s a glimpse at some of the top Canadian universities that accept GRE scores, and their respective GRE requirements:Download the ebook GRE Cutoff Scores for Top 35 UniversitiesTOEFL/IELTS score: Both the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) are accepted at universities in Canada, Germany and the US, and seek to assess your command and fluency over the English language. Your ability to read, write, speak and listen comfortably in English will be gauged, and a score will be given accordingly. In countries apart from USA, this lays a very important role in the admission committee’s mind as it gives a reflection of your communication abilities. In the TOEFL iBT (Internet Based Test), each of the four sections will be marked between 0 to 30 for a possible total score of 120. On the IELTS, marks are allotted between 0 to 9, with 0.5 increments. You will be given an individual band score for each skill, in addition to an overall score. A good TOEFL score is anything between 100 to 120, while a score of 7.5 and above is generally regarded as a good IELTS score. While the IELTS enjoys a worldwide acceptance, the TOEFL is generally used in the US, although all American universities also accept IELTS scores. Owing to its versatility, IELTS scores are valid in over 10,000 institutions and universities worldwide, including countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany.Download eBook: A Definitive Guide for IELTS hereAcademic GPA: One of the most crucial factors that impact your admission chances would be your GPA referred to as CGPA or percentages in a lot of Indian Institutions. Given the fact that a student’s CGPA does not completely reflect the student’s potential but to a certain extent about the faculty, college & competition in the university, it’s seen as a relative criterion. To explain in simple words, your GPA is considered as good or bad depending on your topper’s GPA. Also, each country requires your to convert your GPA to scale of 4. Read about how to convert your GPA for USA, Canada & Germany here>>Statement of Purpose: The Statement of Purpose, or the SOP, is a crucial ingredient to a successful application. Because universities abroad typically receive hundreds of applications with similar credentials, your SOP is your one chance to showcase your individuality and your dreams and aspirations, and set yourself apart from your peers. The SOP is commonly thought to be a replacement for the personal interview, and for that reason, it is crucial that you nail it just right. For the lowdown on how to craft the perfect winning SOP, make sure you checkout our top tips and tricks!Download ebook: How To Craft A Winning SOP >>Letters of Recommendation: Written by former professors or employers, the LOR is an important testament to your intellectual and personal character, and is essentially a promise from one professor to another that you are an intelligent, diligent student, and deserving of an admit. Ideally, you should get LORs from professors who have supervised your thesis or research project, Heads of Departments, or from professors who have taught you and known you for a substantial period of time, especially if they are well-known in their field and have published extensively. You can also submit LORs from employers, although it is recommended you only do this if you’ve been out of college for a few years.Work and research experience: As a fresh undergraduate, you aren’t typically expected to have work experience apart from the usual internship or voluntary work. However, if you do have such experience, make sure to highlight it in your CV and SOP. Most applicants tend to apply to graduate school straight after finishing undergrad, and view work experience as a filler, but work experience not only allows you to gain a fresh perspective on the world, but also facilitates the development of new, life-defining skills, and the ability to work in and lead diverse groups of people, all of which are paramount to graduate applications. As far as research is concerned, do remember, universities in the US are vastly different from Indian ones, especially because of the onus they place on research and development, to the extent where applicants with a relatively lower GPA have won admits to top schools based purely on their excellent research experience in the past. If you have substantial research experience, it would be a good idea to get your research supervisors to write you a reference letter, and also issue you any relevant certificates. Both research and work experience are especially beneficial in making up for any shortfalls in you GPA or GRE scores, and also in getting scholarships and other aid.What are the common mistakes students make while applying?Time, as they say, is money, and this is especially true for MS applications, where every single day is of prime importance. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that you plan your application well in advance and follow a proper timeline so that you don’t find yourself floundering for time. So what are some of the mistakes that trip up study abroad aspirants? Let’s take a look:Starting GRE preparation late: Your GRE, as we mentioned, is one of the most important building blocks of your application, so ideally, you must give yourself sufficient time to start preparing for the test, so you can identify your weak points and work on them properly. You also need to have enough time so that if you find your GRE scores unsatisfactory, you can choose to rewrite it.Inability to shortlist universities: Of course, Harvard, MIT and Caltech are the dream of millions, but realistically, is your profile compatible with the stringent requirements of these universities? Before applying, draw up a list of 8-10 universities you would like to attend, based on criteria such as GRE requirements, tuition fee, acceptance rate, past admits, alum profiles, cultural & research field compatibility with faculty etc. Remember, you will be spending quite a bit on application fees, so make sure you don’t waste time and money on schools that are unrealistically out of your league.Download The SELECT Strategy to Shortlist Universities eBOOK hereLacking the relevant details about deadlines and requirements: Universities in the US and Canada are extremely strict about the application deadlines: for instance, for fall admit, applications usually close in the first week of December of the previous year. Many aspirants often fail to take cognizance of deadlines, or neglect to send in their applications keeping in mind the time it would take to reach the US. A good idea is to note down the application deadlines of the various programs you want to apply to, well in advance. Do remember that if you are applying for a scholarship, deadlines are typically earlier. Additionally, many schools have an early bird round, which closes much before the usual deadlines. Applying in an early bird round greatly improves your chances at an offer letter, so if you’re ready, you can send in your applications right in time for that!Consulting unofficial/inaccurate/random websites: The internet is a quagmire of information, and it is easy to fall into a trap of misinformation if you are not careful. While researching for application information, be sure to stick to only the university’s official websites. If you are still doubtful or have any questions, be sure to write to the admissions help desk of the university to be sure.Sending an incomplete or inadequate application: Applying overseas is not as straightforward as applying to universities in India: there is a lot more paperwork involved, such as healthcare insurance, transcripts, and visas, and in order to prevent your application from being summarily rejected, you need to ensure that your application package is complete. Overwhelmed?Don’t worry. Please find the MS application checklist right below to help you plan your entire application process.Download the eBOOK “MS Admit: The Application Checklist” hereWe hope you found this information useful, and now have some clarity on the various building blocks to ensuring an offer letter to your dream university.

It is also important to ensure that you do the tests around the time that you will be giving the GRE, so that your mind and body are ready to be alert - 8am, 10am, or whatever slot you will be booking.Begin your preparation with Manhattan's first mock to know where you stand and what you need to work on - weaknesses. That's free.After that - using the same email id with which you make your Manhattan a/c, go on Amazon and buy the Manhattan Sentence Equivalence book - Kindle version. Then email your amazon receipt to Manhattan from that same email id. They will activate your mock tests - 6, valid for 6 months. (Google this process once to make sure its still valid, shouldn't have changed since I just did it 1.5 months back). This way you can get the tests for less than 500 rupees.2. VocabularyVocabulary needs practice from the start, everyday. For that the Magoosh app is good, but a better way to do it is - download the 'Quizlet' app on your phone and search for Rajeshwar1247 or ""Magoosh GRE Flashcards"". This kind individual has uploaded everything from the Magoosh Vocab book onto this app. You can learn and quiz yourself through this, so its a much faster method. Start doing this asap.Don’t bother learning too many words, these 1000 words should be enough. The difficulty on the actual test is not that words are unfamiliar, but that the sentences are complex.So instead of buying more vocabulary books and wasting money, practice all the Sentence Equivalence and Text Completion questions in the Manhattan 5lb book, note down each word you do not know, and make a separate list of those. Also go through the answers to catch your mistakes.3. Analytical WritingAll the issue/argument topics are up on the ETS website, but going through them all does not help. First, Any guide (Official ETS Verbal guide, Manhattan RC guide) will provide you with an explanation of the general patterns of each type of essay. It is important to understand this and then read a few sample essays that score high (again found in guides).The writing sections are not testing knowledge but instead structure and critical thinking ability. If you have a flair for writing, this should not be too challenging. However, if not, then take up a few topics and write your own essays, and then compare them with sample essays provided in the verbal or Manhattan guide. You will notice that you have missed out on a few arguments, and that will slowly help you think more critically, and write better essays.4. Verbal and Quant PracticeStep 1 is to do the ETS General Test guide cover to cover, to understand the test and the Verbal and Quant sections. Do all the questions in the book and ensure you are clear about every concept in Quant.Then you begin practice. Here the Manhattan 5lb. book is the best resource, with over 2000 questions. Solve questions in small sets of 20–25 and then go through the answers, understand your mistakes and note your weak areas. Use the insights from this practice and your mock tests to understand topics that you need to be more thorough in.Then pick up the Manhattan book that is specific to your area of weakness and go deeper into that particular topic to completely clarify the concept for yourself. I did this with inequalities, but did not need to for most other topics. Don’t do this unless you feel it is required.For VERBAL in particular, please also do the Official ETS Verbal Guide a few days before your actual GRE exam, since it is important to get accustomed to ETS’ way of testing.If you create a plan covering 25–40 Vocabulary words a day, 40 practice questions and 2 essays and 1 mock practice test a week, you will be more than prepared for a 330+As a bonus, I did all this without spending a penny (except on the manhattan tests). This drive link has all of the resources I have mentioned abovehttps://drive.google.com/drive/f...You will find them easily with some searching.All the best for your test and hope this is useful!","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice tests from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). After this you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams (about 4 hrs.). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e. Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or, you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes. But do use the three aforementioned tests! All you have to do is create a user ID at each of the websites (Kaplan, Manhattan and Princeton). If you buy the Official ETS GRE guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also to analyze the stats for their future test papers. We will not know which section is the experimental one so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section. What we do know is that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is imperative that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Let’s tackle the Verbal section first. (As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes, there are numerous word lists available, but do not start with them first! The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the decks. Do it every day or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But, this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy (WPME)' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible. Chris's approach is brilliant and his enthusiasm is infectious). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands!Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But it’s of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read through the question/passage and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension section, you might come across huge comprehensions with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how they have approached the question. This is vital step for improving your attempts at RCs. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend buying the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section thoroughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests (paper-based) apart from the Powerprep software, which are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these questions will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). Sometimes, you tend to rush into solving the question without looking at the question completely. You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. In the later stages of practicing, start solving with a time limit for each question.  You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions.  For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is explained in the ETS Official GRE material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but, you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully observe what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too! (If you are an Asian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you’ll face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty badly here. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But, I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents. I do know that reading through numerous essays (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section' online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have at least 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day. So I’d recommend giving one of the paper-based tests from the Official ETS GRE material a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time, so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations for the correct answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test. Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now it’s your time to perform. Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel aren’t doing well, but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve a well-rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well. You have the other sections to make up for it. If you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position! Also please don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you’re concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or at least what you aimed for, remember GRE is not the end! I could not get the score I aimed for and initially I was disappointed. Soon I realized that it’s really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed, you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I scored 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know!) and breezed through them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you! Best of luck in cracking the GRE! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Also, I'd really like to know how your exam went, the difficulties/challenges you faced and how you overcame them. Everyone has a different perspective. I have merely written my approach above and I'd love to know your approach. Mentioning score isn't mandatory. You can simply comment on the post or send me a message about your experience with the GRE. Cheers!Sorry for the long post !

So, using it will not be effective preparation with two months to go. Don't waste your time on this.MagooshThere is pretty much no downside to getting the Magoosh Flashcards app since it is free and mostly has words that have a high likelihood of turning up on the test. I started drilling with this app a month before my GRE. Several times, the GRE uses secondary meanings of words and the app does a good job of illustrating these meanings with nice examples. For a free resource, Magoosh is incredibly good and I would recommend reading their GRE blog once in a while.A couple of days before the test, reset your Magoosh word app and just go through all the words again to ensure you know most. If you forget a few advanced ones, don't panic. The probability of them showing up on the test is probably low.General Vocab advice:Write down words that you find difficult. Maybe even make flashcards of your own. Attribute difficult words to settings you are familiar with - traits of your friends, characters from books and TV shows, etc. Use them in conversation (the jokes your friends make about your attempt at grandiloquence may actually help you remember a word's meaning better than any app), throw them into your writing and make mnemonics. Basically, whatever works to make them stick!Like the New Yorker on facebook and read articles about topics that interest you. Each time you see an unfamiliar word, try guessing its meaning based on context and then cross-check using ""define <word>"" on google.Manhattan books and Barron's 800:I personally used neither but Barron's 800 might be a good tool for building vocabulary. The general opinion amongst people about Manhattan prep seems to be positive. So, I guess you can use it for practice.Now, here is what's important. Just learning the words with apps and books will not be enough. You will need to know how they work in context, and for this, you will need to practice actual test-type questions.Get the ETS Official Guide and make sure you do every single question in the book. Also take the practice tests seriously, analyze your weaknesses and work on them systematically.Hope this helps.

GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"

This GRE score will help to candidates and University to complete the application process. Often applicants are eager to know what a good GRE score to get into a particular University/College/ Institute. The GRE score will differ depending upon the Institution you choose. Apart from University/ College, The score would be dependent upon the field you select.The GRE verbal and quantitative sections are scored on a scale of 130-170 in one-point increment in each of the two sections. You can score anywhere from 130 to 170 which means that the number of possible scores that can be obtained are limited to just 41. This range means that even a small jump in your GRE score can give a boost to your percentile ranking.Here is a list of US universities with the average GRE scores for their MS and PhD programs:Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): Verbal: 158Quantitative: 159Writing: 5.3Stanford University: Verbal: 159Quantitative: 158Writing: 4.8University of California, Berkeley: Verbal: 153 – 156 score rangeQuantitative: 167Writing: 4.5University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA): Verbal: 155Quantitative: 167Writing: 5.0University of Virginia: Verbal: 163Quantitative: 166Writing: 4.5University of Michigan – Ann Arbor: Verbal: 160 rangeQuantitative: 167Writing: 5.0University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill: Verbal: 158Quantitative: 160Writing: 4.5Georgia Institute of Technology: Verbal: 158Quantitative: 167Writing: 4.3University of California – San Diego: Verbal: 162Quantitative: 160Writing: 5.5University of Illinois – Urbana/Champaign: Verbal: 155Quantitative: 165Writing: 4.0University of Wisconsin – Madison: Verbal: 163Quantitative: 731Writing: 4.5University of Washington: Verbal: 156Quantitative: 167Writing: 4.0Pennsylvania State University: Verbal: 150Quantitative: 165Writing: 3.0University of Florida (UFL): Verbal: 154Quantitative: 165Writing: 3.0University of Texas , Austin: Verbal: 155Quantitative: 165Writing: 4.0Ohio State University: Verbal: 156Quantitative: 165Writing: 4.0California Institute of Technology: Verbal: 160Quantitative: 157Writing: 5.0Duke University: Verbal: 160Quantitative: 160Writing: 4.5University of Chicago: Verbal: 158Quantitative: 167Writing: 4.0Northwestern University: Verbal: 160Quantitative: 160 Writing: 5.0Washington University in St. Louis: Verbal: 161Quantitative: 160Writing: 5.0Johns Hopkins University: Verbal: 163Quantitative: 164Writing: 4.8Rice University: Verbal: 160Quantitative: 167Writing: 5.0Emory University: Verbal: 153Quantitative: 306Writing: 4.0-6.0University of Notre Dame: Verbal: 165Quantitative: 165 Writing: 5.3Vanderbilt University: Verbal: 157Quantitative: 166Writing: 4.8William and Mary: Verbal: 158Quantitative: 160Writing: 4.5Johns Hopkins UniversityVerbal: 159Quantitative: 162Writing: 4.2Universirty of Texas At DallasAverage Verbal Score 150Average Quant Score: 163Rutgers UniversityAverage Verbal Score 152Average Quant Score: 162","Good GRE and TOEFL scores are necessary, but not sufficient to get into any top 10 US university. I've heard an admissions committee member of a top 10 University say this: ""All Indians get high scores in GRE, and excellent recommendation letters, and well written SOPs. We don't know why, and we don't care. If the candidate's GRE score is good, and recommendation letters and SOP are good, we just ignore both of those and use other criteria. If any of those are not up to the mark, we reject the candidate.""So what criteria are actually used?Preference is given to colleges in India that the selection committee members have heard of.If a student from college X with GPA/Percentage Y does well in the university, then the university starts regularly taking students with GPA greater than Y from college X. (Of course, if the student does badly, they'll increase the cutoff percentage, or worse yet, stop taking students from X.)Occasionally, they take a chance on an unheard of (for them) college, and admit someone based on a strong resume. That person pretty much holds the fate of the future students of that college in his hands.So your best bet is to apply to universities where your seniors have gone before.","First of all if you are aiming top 10 universities in United States here are a couple of links that might interest you the most throughout this hectic and exhausting process How To Get Into Stanford & Other Graduate Schools and Helping You Get Into Your Dream School (This is supposed to be authored by the famous Stanford university professor Andrew Ng) and will help you the most in the process.Coming to the question I was fortunate to attend a conference organized by Welcome to USIEF ::(United States Indian Educational Foundation) last year regarding the admissions process where delegates from around 100 universities came over to Delhi to enlighten students regarding the different disciplines at the university, the admission criteria, visa application and other supplemental stuff. I posed the following question to one of the delegates in the committee, ""What criteria does a university use to normalize profiles of students who have done great at academics, Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and TOEFL but have practically no internship experience, bad projects etc against those who have scored modestly in GRE and TOEFL have secured a bearable percentage of marks and have strong internship, international and competitive flavor to their profile?"". And to my delight the answer I got was a positive one, He told that university only requires a student to score the minimal GRE and TOEFL scores that renders the student eligible to apply to the university and after this initial screening is done the application is passed on to a committee of students and professors where the profile is grilled and brownie points are given for the student's outstanding achievements and then there is a weight to weight comparison of profiles between students who managed to pass the initial screening, keeping this in mind I would say try to score well in GRE but even if you don't manage very high scores don't get discouraged you must ensure that you manage a score so that you pass the initial screening phase of your application and as far as top 10 universities in States are concerned the only thing that matters is you and your achievements and most importantly the people from whom you manage to get your Letters of Recommendation, if those people are well known in their respective fields the other parts of your application might just play very little role, and if the recommendation is strong then I do believe it will be an admit in most of the cases.Conclusion : Strive hard to manage both good scores and most importantly build a good profile for which you can participate in internationally recognized events, collaborative research experience will do a world of good, and other such extracurricular activities. Best of Luck.","Getting into top universities of US is really a big challenge…GRE Scores for Top US Universities -Every school has its own set of requirements. There are U.S. universities that accept students with very low or no GRE scores, while others require scores above 330. o stop looking for the general GRE cutoff score requirements and start learning how universities accept international students.If you believe that all U.S. colleges and universities have an average GRE cutoff score, well you are very wrong. Each school may or may not disclose their minimum GRE score required for admission. The same condition applies to academic percentage, GMAT score, etc.Some universities have minimum TOEFL scores required for admission.Generally, a total of 320 or more in GRE, and at least, 161 in the quantitative section, can fetch a candidate admission in one of the top universities in the US. The GRE scores would differ depending upon the school you choose. Again, within a particular university / school, it would vary depending upon the field you select.Average TOEFL scoreEnglish proficiency is an important factor in successful admission. The students are therefore advised to work in this area for better chances of selection.Average TOEFL score required is 90 generally.. Still some top universities accept as low as 76 and some universities demands for even 100 or 100 + as well. So it totally varies from school to school and the particular course you are applying.Other than GRE and TOEFL.. Important components required to enter into top universities of USAExceptional GPA - Some universities choose to waive off the GRE score if your grade point average is above 3.4 on a scale of 0 to 4. So it pays to focus on your undergraduate degree and achieving an excellent GPA.Work Experience - Some universities waive off the GRE/GMAT if you have relevant work-experience of four years or more that is closely related to the degree that you aim to study.Strong SOP - Your SOP has the power to make or break your application. Universities treat SOP very seriously and they read your SOP. It is very important you write a good Statement of purpose interweaving your goals, your achievements, how will you achieve your goals and what do you really want to accomplish in life, etc. Statement of purpose gives the admission committee to judge your perspective of life, your career aspirations, your ethics, your technical aptitude, your vision for life, etc. The key point is, it is your chance to explain to admission committee why you are going for higher education and what is your main purpose…Universities give utmost importance to SOP.LOR - Often Universities refer to your Letters of Recommendations as a validation of what all achievements you have written about in your resume. Also, they serve as a proof positive of your work in an organization or your tenure in a college as the LORs are often requested on the official letterheads.Hope you found this article useful and informative…"
GRE,I am a BTech (CSE) graduate from India (Gujarat). How do I apply for an MS program in the USA?,https://www.quora.com//I-am-a-BTech-CSE-graduate-from-India-Gujarat-How-do-I-apply-for-an-MS-program-in-the-USA,"TOEFEL, Masters in Computer Science in the United States, Master of Science Degrees in the United States, International English Language Testing System (IELTS), Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",13,"I would point out some of the things that you need to work on the most while applying in the US, Also you can refer to the answers already given here and get the most info you can.1. A good CGPA or percentage in your Undergraduate: As we all must know that the GRE does not have subject specific test and hence your CGPA is the only thing that reflects your knowledge in a particular subject. (This might be overlooked if you do your masters from your home country or you have been working after completing your graduate school)  2. High GRE score. A score of 325+ is required in order secure admission into a top college. Your GRE score reflects your aptitude and command on English knowledge that is very vital to survive in a cut throat competition.  3. High TOEFL score. A TOEFL score of 100+ is considered very decent, and can easily get you into a top 20 college in the US. Your TOEFL score might also get you fellowship and scholarship. (More info in provided in the coming sections).  4. Internship/Job Experience.   If you are applying in a US university directly after your graduation then you must have decent amount of internship certificates. Recently I read a study in Economics Times regarding how Ivy league colleges are providing special acknowledgement to those who have had working experience in a start up (Does not matter if it was successful or not). I would suggest you to get as much internship as you can in MNC/NGO/Start-Up.  If you have already passed out your graduate school and currently working then I would suggest you to get minimum of 2 years of experience. But if you have been working in a company for 7-8 years then your chances to get into these universities get a bit low, as with age people to tend to be rigid and are a bit difficult to train.  5. Recommendation letter and Statement of purpose: These are only viewed by the college you applied in once you have impressed them by your CV and academics.   Many people tend to copy their SOP or get it written by someone else. It is very important to understand that all top universities have their interview rounds and they might ask you about your SOP, and it is better to write your SOP on your own rather than getting embarrassed in front of your professors. Writing your SOP is really easy, all you need to do is tell them why you want to join a particular university, trust me the more truthful you are the better it reflects to them.  Moving onto the Letter of recommendation part, this is more like a certification from your seniors (At Workplace), Professors from your regular college and Professors from any summer/winter school you attended. I wouldn’t go into detail for this section as it is really easy to get a letter of recommendation in countries like India etc.PS: Application in US universities start way in advance, like a year in advance and hence you should be ready with all the documents ASAP.But if you dont have the most important credential that is the GRE score, then please consider delaying your application. Now there is a general myth surrounding the whole application process is that people fail to get their educational visa on time, This is one of the most irritating question people have for me. The visa process is made to understand the purpose of the trip and if you are no shady, they want to send you to America and not stop you from going there. Just be honest with them and you will be just fine. the interview will last not longer than a minute or 2 and its that simple. I will never know why people involve middleman for this very reason, thats just over complicating and is a process where you will waste a lot of money.Make sure to check out our app VOLT on Google play store.

You can follow these steps:Take a sample GRE test (Most preferably power prep I). If you score a total of 300 for example, then you can guess your final score to be in between 315-320.Then analyze your profile (take a note of all research papers you published, going to publish and project work).Go through the similar profiles in Stupidsid.com or Edulix and short some universities (around 4 univs).Then start preparing for GRE and make sure you reach your target of 315. After the exam is done, select the 4 universities you shortlisted for Educational Testing Service (ETS) to report your scores to (by this way of selecting universities beforehand, you can save $100 here).Apply for TOEFL or International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and prepare to get the minimum score required by your department in the universities selected. (with TOEFL of IELTS – British Council you can save $72 by selecting universities beforehand)After you are done with these exams, start preparing your SOP. At the same time, reach out to your professors asking for recommendation letters. Help them prepare recommendation letters on your behalf. Also get the required no.of sets of transcripts from your university.Once you are okay with SOP and required LORs, open the university website and fill out the online application. After completing this application, you'll be required to upload scanned copies of mark sheets.Complete the online application, pay the application fee, wait for university to send a mail with student id and finally courier the transcripts to those universities (Make sure you mention your student id on top of the cover).Wait for university to mail its decision.If accepted, they'll ask you to send bank statement showing liquid assets amounting to 1 year of expenses you are going to spend in that university along with affidavit of support (link to this affidavit will be sent to you in the acceptance mail) and also they'll ask you to get some vaccinations done.After approving your bank statement, they'll send you the I20.On receiving I20, pay your SEVIS fee and apply for F-1 Student Visas (US).Once your visa is approved, you are free to go.I guess, I have covered all the steps here. If needed further clarifications, you are free to pm me.All the Best.Edit1: sorry guys your have to start your preparation before 18 months, not 1 year.","I'm quite surprised to see that nobody has mentioned about getting an Education Consultant (an unpaid and official one ofcourse), in the answers. I myself have been searching a lot lately and found out a lot of things. Personally, I feel that it's best to search on your own because there are very few people who actually tell you about - Education USA (may be they themselves don't know about it). http://www.usief.org.in/New-Delh...Visit their office and talk to them about your interests. They'll guide you better. Certainly you won't be able to do everything by yourself. We all definitely need support and help especially with writing SOP(s).Other answers are helpful in some or the other way but we cannot do everything just by reading Quora answers. Not everyone can. Also, you definitely don't need to hire a paid consultant for USA. Checkout YouTube videos. Videos are more helpful. There is this guy with a YouTube channel named ""That Indian Guy"".He has made a lot of videos for people planning to go to the US for higher studies. All the best!","Follow these steps. Start ahead of time. Don’t wait till last minute. There’s a lot to be done.Evaluate your profile. What are your strengths, your weaknesses.Determine your long term and short term goals. Long term is where will you want to be in 7–10 years, short term is immediately after graduation.Start studying for the standardization exams. SAT for Undergrad, GRE for Grad school. You may need to take the TOEFL as well.Take a test prep exam. This will give you a good indication of where you stand and what you should expect on the real exam scores.Based on your goals, grades, GRE scores, research which universities are applicable to you. Break them down into three categories: Out of reach (20–30% chance of making it in), medium (60–70% of making it) and easy (100% chance of making) - pick out 3 in each category for now.Start developing a list of 5 recommenders. These are people who you are comfortable with, who know your work, your class work, your research etc.Take your standardized test. Study harder and re-take if you’re unhappy with the scores.With the list of universities at hand, start an in depth research into the program you will be applying to. This will help in writing your SOP.Start writing your SOP for one university. Write about what your goals are, long term and short term; write about how the university will help you achieve these goals; and how the university is a good fit for you. But like with any service in this world, it has to be mutually beneficial to both sides. So then talk about how the university benefits by having a candidate like you - by showing what you bring to the table and how, once you graduate, you will be a good brand ambassador for that university and program. If you’re applying to a research program, pick out which professor you would like to work with and write about joining his research group with a particular set of skills you possess. Write about a research idea you have and would like to work on; even if it may not be practical at this point in time. Put your ideas out there, the professor will be impressed that you have thought about his research in depth and will want to work with a student like you.Reach out to the top 3 out of 5 recommenders. Create your resume and give it to them. Talk to each one of them about what aspects of your resume you would like them to focus on. This will cover a wide variety of your skills, personality, work ethic etc.Put the whole application together. Review your SOP and let a few other close friends, family or professors review it as well. Politely remind your recommenders the deadline is approaching.Submit, sit back and relax. You’ve done it. You’re on your way to fulfilling your goals!I have created a detailed schedule for each task, which will serve as a great checklist for everything. Feel free to use it to make sure that your application gets submitted on time.Good luck!"
GRE,How do I score 320 in GRE in 20 days?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-score-320-in-GRE-in-20-days,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",17,"Making time would be your biggest concern so you will have to make time everyday or squeeze it into your busy schedule. You need to know the following about the GRE exam before you start your preparation.The GRE exam has 3 sections the analytical writing section, the verbal section and the quants section.The analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to your GRE score so you needn’t break your head about it.The Quants and verbal section are for 170 marks each. The quants is the scoring section and you should ideally be looking to get 170/170 in this section. Anything more than 160 is a great score when it comes to verbal.You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 minutes in each of these sections.Something that most of the people don’t know is that the GRE is actually only for 80 marks but the marks are awarded out of 320 so that we don’t assume that a person who scores a 40 is only half as good as a person who scores 80 so the scores are given on a scale of 260–340.You needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.Getting to the hardest part of it all PREPARATION:You needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.Most people find the Quants section easy so you should just be trying to brush up on your basic concepts. I would suggest you make your concepts concrete and don’t get carried away in cramming as many formulas as possible. Once you’re confident enough try taking up a mock test and see where you stand, analyze your mistakes and then go back to those topics and make sure that there isn’t an Achilles heel. Spend as little time as possible preparing for Quants and I don’t think it will take up a lot of time. 1 hour a day for a month and you should be good to go.The dicey section is the verbal section and it will definitely be the make or mar factor in your GRE since you may not be accustomed to the language used. The best way to prepare for the verbal section is to READ. The verbal section is predominantly vocabulary based and being thorough with vocabulary might just make the difference between you getting into an average institute or premier institute abroad.Please try to stick to the following schedule:Spend two hours each day for the verbal section of GRE and one hour for the Quants section.Make sure that your preparation doesn't take a back seat during the weekends or due to some occasion like a friend's birthday.GRE Quants in a week:People are usually comfortable with the Quants section. If you are from an engineering or science background, you are already leaps and bounds ahead of your peers.1.Brush up your concepts and make sure you don’t get carried away and cram as many formulas as you can.2. Make sure that you approach each problem logically .3. Cover all the bases and make sure to go through each topic since Quants is a scoring section and you should ideally be aiming for 170/170 and nothing else.4. Practice each type of question and double check the concepts from high school that you never really understood but chose to skip anyway :P5. Be stubborn and don’t proceed until you get it right.Check out the best self study partner for cracking the GRE Quants section. I am pretty sure you will find this useful.GRE verbal in 10 days:GRE is predominantly a vocabulary based section. The quants section of the GRE isn’t very hard to crack and the analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to you GRE score. The verbal section will generally be the make or mar factor in your GRE and will make the difference between you getting into a premier institute or average institute abroad. If you are from an English medium school you would already be strong with your basics which makes it all the more easy for you to prepare yourself. Being thorough with the high frequency words can actually help you a lot. Check out the Barron’s 333.There are very few types of questions in the verbal section like text completion, sentence correction, reading comprehension and critical reasoning. I highly recommend the GRE verbal prep: A definitive guide. It is probably the best study material for a quick preparation. There are loads of practice questions and tests that are available along with videos which will definitely help you remember the words and their in-context meaning. Several shortcuts, tips and mnemonics are also a part of the videos. When you connect things with pictures, you remember them better which is exactly what the videos do. The etymology of the words are also dealt with in detail so that you can understand how a word came into existence and how it has evolved over the years.The MOCK frenzy with an error log:You still have a few days left. You should be taking up as many mock tests as possible. Go CRAZY!Keep solving questions and analyzing them.Keep a check on your progress.Identify the topics which aren’t really comfortable with. They may turn out to be the Achilles Heel on the day of the exam so don’t leave anything to chance.There is no point in solving umpteen number of problems from topics which are your strong suit. Solve more problems related to the topic which you aren’t comfortable withSolve → Analyze → Identify errors → solve more → RepeatOn the day before the exam JUST CHILL. Stop learning and don’t learn anything new since it is more likely that you will get confused because of it. Brush up on the concepts and KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK!A few of the following tips may come in handy:The GRE is a timed test: If we had all the time we need, then every one of us would get the perfect score on the GRE. But the GRE is a timed test, so it is important to not only be accurate but also quick when it comes to answering the questions. So when preparing for the GRE, time yourself. You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 mins both in the Verbal and the Quants section. Attempt a lot of mock tests it will help you a lot.Be aware of the wrong answers:The wrong answers generally tend to fall under certain categories which will help you eliminate the wrong choices when it comes to the GRE verbal reasoning section or reading comprehensions.The choices are most probably wrong if they:Assume too muchAre beyond the scope of the passageAre too extremeAre true but involve outside knowledgeAre too specific/too broadSave the worst for the last:They usually say save the best for the last but it doesn’t hold good when it comes to the competitive exams like GRE. You will end up wasting time if you attempt the unfamiliar questions. If you find a question complex, it is better to leave it for the time being and improve your score by answering the questions related to the easier and familiar questions.Utilize the scratch pad:Take short notes while reading the comprehension passage in the space allotted. Eliminate the unnecessary details and words which are just present to throw you off.The following are a few tips that might come in handy when it comes to the reading comprehension but they might also be applied to any question in the verbal section.DUMB them down:Questions on reading comprehension passages have the most gray area when compared to any other type of question in the GRE.Avoid skimming through the questions without understanding what is specifically being asked. If you find a question or choice confusing rephrase the question in your one words.Be on the look out for concessions:In many cases, the author may have a strong voice towards a certain topic or aspect in the passages. The author might have a strong opinion towards certain aspects in a passage and argue for it throughout the passage but then the author might suddenly stop doing so and make subtle or drastic concessions to the opposing side which will weaken the arguments that were previously made in the reading comprehension passage. Make sure that you aren’t thrown by such concessions.Make use of the context:If the question asked is related to a specific line in the reading comprehension passage, it won’t help if you just go back and read the sentence. The thumb rule is to read at least one sentence before and after the aforementioned line.Zero in on the idea behind the longer passages:Majority of the reading comprehension passages that you will come across while taking the GRE will be short but on the off chance that you encounter one or two longer ones, it is advisable to focus more on the first and last paragraphs of the passage and find the big picture of the passage, since time is of the essence.Find the tone of the passage:The tone of the passage can be found using the choice of words or the turn of phrases used by the author. Even if the tone appears to be neutral, assume that it is complex and look for the tone. You can arrive at the tone by observing the diction or by asking the following questions:Does the author feel positively or negatively about a certain topic?What aspect of the topic does the author criticize?What concerns does the author raise through the passage?Which adverbs and adjectives does the author use to voice his opinion?Last but not the leastWatch your diet: An important factor which most students ignore to their detriment is their health and diet. This is very important both during your preparation and while taking the test. Ensure that you stick to a nutritious diet since you will need a lot of energy during your preparation. It is a good thing to avoid eating outside especially junk food, during your preparatory phase. Also, refrain from drinking, partying and taking recreational drugs a week or two before the Test day.P.S.

However, I started with a good foundation. With my SAT history and intense workload at college, I scored 320+ on my first mock test after I reviewed the vocabulary — in other words, it took me nothing but memorizing a few words to get myself at around 320.People at different levels or from different backgrounds require different strategies and time investment to reach that 320 goal. Regardless, the 20 days I spent got me 15+ points further. I can’t tell you how to reach 320 without knowing much about your background and needs, but I can tell you how to utilize a shorter time period to make some good progress:Focus. The famous 80/20 Rule states that roughly 80% of your outcomes come from 20% of your inputs.[1] This applies to GRE as well. There will be areas on GRE where you can most quickly improve. When the time is limited, you need to focus on those areas to make the most progress. Take a few mock tests and find those spots, and work on them relentlessly.Make mistakes. Don’t worry about them at all. It is a good thing to find yourself making mistakes when you’re practicing than you do on the real test. When you practice, you want to expose all the possible ways you make mistakes, and then find ways to avoid them. The reality is, aside from the vocabulary, GRE hardly covers anything that esoteric. In many cases, it’s the silly mistakes you make that really keeps you from getting your dream score. Learning how to avoid those mistakes can allow you to improve quickly. You just need to identify them first, by making them.Analyze. Don’t just practice questions after questions. Think about them. Find patterns, find how you get them wrong, and find quicker ways to solve these questions. At the end of the day, it’s not the quantity of questions that you practiced on that matters the most, it’s how you treat them. Don’t just focus on getting the questions right, focus on how to get better.Consolidate. After you’ve practiced, made mistakes, and analyzed them, now it’s time to consolidate your takeaways. Make yourself a list of actions you can take during the actual test to help yourself perform better. This could include double checking your zeros, or being more alarmed of particular words, or things you tend to forget or overlook. Take a good look at them before you take the test.Many of my friends have asked me how I got the score I have. Frankly this is it. Now I’m building Gregory to help people do these things automatically. I’d be happy to hear any thoughts/feedback on it.Footnotes[1] What Is The 80/20 Rule And Why It Will Change Your Life","First nothing is impossible for anyone to achieve. 21 days is a very short period of time and I don’t want to discourage you. But I do have some tips for a preparation.Vocabulary Building for Verbal Section - Take two alphabets each day and start memorizing at least 30 words per alphabet. Try grouping the synonyms together and writing down the antonyms. This will help you learning more words easily. Download the Magoosh Vocabulary flash cards app on your phone and start preparing right away.Barron’s 3000 word list is available online. You should read it and try acing as many words as possible.Quantitative - Make a time table with the detailed versions of every section in mathematics.

Make ALERT AREAS AS THOSE YOU ARE TAKING MOST OF THE TIME SOLVING.Each day read essays on different GRE topics. Try framing your own essays and also practice the “ISSUE” Topic that comes for writing. It will be a refreshing break from your daily maths practice and will also help you think pragmatically in the direction of the topic.It is important to familiarize yourself with 3 hours while taking the GRE exam. Register for an online test series by Manhattan Prep or Princeton review. You should at least take 6 online tests before appearing for the GRE if your are aiming a score above 320.

In many cases, it’s the silly mistakes you make that really keeps you from getting your dream score. Learning how to avoid those mistakes can allow you to improve quickly. You just need to identify them first, by making them.Analyze. Don’t just practice questions after questions. Think about them. Find patterns, find how you get them wrong, and find quicker ways to solve these questions. At the end of the day, it’s not the quantity of questions that you practiced on that matters the most, it’s how you treat them. Don’t just focus on getting the questions right, focus on how to get better.Consolidate. After you’ve practiced, made mistakes, and analyzed them, now it’s time to consolidate your takeaways. Make yourself a list of actions you can take during the actual test to help yourself perform better. This could include double checking your zeros, or being more alarmed of particular words, or things you tend to forget or overlook. Take a good look at them before you take the test.Many of my friends have asked me how I got the score I have. Frankly this is it.

It is unique because, as the name suggests, it displays not just the meaning and the sentence of the word, but also a relevant image. After using it I found that its much easier to relate to the images, and hence remember them as compared to remembering sentences to get the meaning.Fun and easy way to build your vocabulary!  It gives you mnemonics with each word, which makes it much easier to remember meanings.Free GRE Vocabulary Flashcards It is another great, fun app which you can use, after you are done with/or as an alternative to the first one.If you have around 3–4 months, then only you should go for reading newspapers, novels and studying the books “Word Power Made Easy” by Norman Lewis.","As far as GRE vocabulary, this is a long time dedication printed process.

GRE,Why do US universities use GRE score for admission to engineering degrees? Why can’t they introduce an exam that actually tests your engineering fundamentals?,https://www.quora.com//Why-do-US-universities-use-GRE-score-for-admission-to-engineering-degrees-Why-can’t-they-introduce-an-exam-that-actually-tests-your-engineering-fundamentals,"Graduate School Admissions in the United States of America, Colleges and Universities in the United States of America, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Engineering",15,"We need a method of sifting through hundreds, if not thousands, of applications for our program alone.  The university has multiple programs, and there are thousands of universities.  That presents a lot of decisions to be made, and huge investment in time and energy.  It is not surprising that we want some tools to make that simpler and yet still accurate.  Yes, we can look at transcripts, but if they are from institutions we don't know anything about, then how do we rank them?  A 4.0 GPA at one institution might be the result of the student doing minimal work, cheating on exams, or even bribing the instructors!  However, it could also be that it is a small school with rigorous instruction and a 3.5 GPA from there is outstanding.We could look at letters of recommendation, but if they come from people we have never heard of before, how do we compare them?  They could be letters from very savvy individuals who really know the strengths and weaknesses of the candidate.  Then again, the letters could be from cousins of the candidate, and some might be forged.We can gain some insight from the application essay of a candidate that show thoughtful and careful analysis, but we have also seen cases where the applicants paid someone else to write the essay.In short, we need some other discriminator to help us understand the quality of candidates — the above measures might work, but they only work in the cases where we know well all the institutions and recommenders.The GRE is imperfect, but it provides a reasonably independent ranking of basic competency that we can use in addition to all those other items.  A student with a 3.5 GPA from a school we never heard of with strong GRE scores is most probably a good candidate, while a students with a GPA of 4.0 from some other unknown school and terrible GRE scores is probably as good a prospect.In our interdisciplinary grad program, we don't require a GRE score if the student has an undergrad degree from an accredited US college because we can figure out the norm based on what we already know.  We can usually do that for well-known colleges in other places — Canada, the UK, Australia — and for a few places in India, China, and elsewhere.  However, there are a lot of schools we don't know anything about.  Plus, sadly, several countries have a culture of cheating on exams and in class that result in inflated scores that do not accurately reflect the capability of students to succeed in our program.The GRE can also provide a check on the TOEFL scores, too.  Someone with a high TOEFL score who does poorly on the GRE is a indication something isn't quite right.Ultimately, we have limited space available in the program.  We want to ensure that as many students with an excellent chance of success are admitted as possible. As for the material on the GRE, yes, it is possible to look a word up in a dictionary, or look up an equation online.  However, it is important to learn when to look something up, and where and how to use it.  Being familiar with those items and knowing how to use them is an important measure of basic preparation and competence.  Furthermore, having worked with some of those things enough to have memorized them also results in a certain level of rigor of thought and problem-solving, and an ability to act correctly quickly. Consider if you went to your doctor because you felt ill.  If the doctor had to look up every symptom to get a clue what was wrong, would that be the same as being able to diagnose you without that?  If your doctor didn't happen to realize you needed to be checked for high blood pressure, and thus never bothered to look that up, what would be missed?  And if you showed up with blood spurting out of a finger, would you want the doctor to then spend time looking up how to stop bleeding and suture a wound?Experience and knowledge are important.  The GRE doesn't have very advanced concepts on it, because we don't expect every applicant to have had exposure to advanced concepts.  Yet.  That is why they are applying for admission here!  The GRE is intended to test on common, basic concepts that anyone with reasonable preparation should have.  If we want proof of greater exposure, we would seek out something such as a GRE subject matter test score (for example).(This is somewhat related to this excellent answer by Jersaon Banes: If advanced algorithms and data structures are never used in industry, then why learn them?  I recommend reading that, too.)","Verbal: In real world, you can always look up for a dictionary if you do not know the meaning of the word. What is the use of mugging up 3000 words just for one stupid exam.GRE is not just about vocabulary. A lot of it is about essay comprehension. And seriously, if you have to memorize 3,000 words just for this one exam, it probably means that you are just not ready for a serious study in English-speaking universities. There are a lot of esoteric words in the exam, but the meaning can mostly be deduced from the context or they are just decoys.Math: This is really taken as a joke. Most of the concepts are covered in your 8th standard with questions even more tougher back then. How can they provide your math capabilities after engineering?What is 8th standard, anyway? Sorry, I am not Indian (many others in Quora are not, either). Does it mean year 8 (out of 12 years of pre-university education)? And what test can actually provide someone’s math capabilities after engineering, by the way?In any case, general GRE quant exam is famously easy, at least for those who intend to study natural science or engineering. Generally, in such cases, it is used only to filter out applicants who are seriously weak.I understand that it is a common exam to test students from various disciplines but ETS is charging about 195$ for an exam. Why can't they prepare different question papers for different disciplines and the syllabus including more of fundamentals learnt during their B-tech which would be more justifiable like in India?FYI, in written English, it is $ 195, not 195$. Secondly, what does B-tech itself mean? I am not Indian, and many others in Quora are not. We can likely surmise that it means Bachelor of Technology. Other than that, we have no idea what you actually studied. And actually, that is the main point.US universities are very laissez-faire when it comes to curriculum. In many universities, as long as you have taken enough number of classes, even in unrelated fields, you can graduate. This is called “liberal arts education”. Even for those who choose a specific major (or two or three specific majors), there is often no standard curriculum which is applicable to multiple universities. Therefore, any standardized exam like GRE must assume you have taken as few relevant classes as possible.This laissez-faire approach also impacts the way US universities evaluate their applicants. US universities rarely put an explicit requirement that you must have taken class X and Y. Instead, they would ask “If this applicant has to take class Z, which requires knowledge in X and Y, will he do well? He may choose to take class X and Y first and then Z, or he may choose to study X and Y on his own and then take class Z.”. US universities also rarely put a tight limit on the duration of their programs. Anyway, they also charge tuition fee based on how many classes (or to be precise, the number of credits) you take. Consequently, there is not much of a problem for the university to take a student who has not taken enough advanced classes but clearly possesses a strong foundation.I know that they are other criteria like SOP, CGPA etc which are taken into account for selecting candidates in US but these days, you can find various experts who can fake your SOP if you pay them, …It is perfectly fine to get a help on the SOP. But the gist of the story can only come from yourself. A more expert writer can only help to weave the words better.… students start working under senior most professor just for a recommendation letter right from their start of college. …Surprise surprise, the content of the letter matters more than who the writer is… Publish papers by paying the journals just for an admission in US. …Do you seriously believe that the professors, who (supposedly) first and foremost are researchers can fall into this trick? Even PhD students should know what the reputable journals are. If the professors don’t know the reputable journals, then it is a huge waving red flag for you. Don’t ever apply to such schools.… And obviously, every college providing their own criteria of grading it becomes difficult to judge the best among two students from two different colleges. …Why is why a standardized exam like GRE comes in handy.Why can't they introduce an exam which can actually test your engineering fundamentals on a common basis?See my answer about the US-style laissez-faire approach to curriculum.","I agree with many of the answers here, but let me add one more thing that I've repeatedly said in public. The GRE can't really help you, but it can hurt you. A good GRE score on an otherwise strong application tells us nothing. But weak GRE scores can set off warning flags. For instance: Yes, the math is almost trivially easy for any STEM student; but do you know many applicants do poorly on it? What does that say?We get applications from literally hundreds of universities around the world, many of which we have literally never heard of before. We need some way of being able to calibrate applications. The GRE offers a few bits of information; but just a few bits.I'm no big fan of the GRE. In fact, for students from known programs, I would be perfectly happy to waive the GRE entirely. The problem is that the applicant doesn't know what a “known” program is, and we don't have the resources to list all of them and deal with questions about the list, etc.Finally, let me just say that studying the vocabulary part was a tremendous learning experience for me. Being forced to study that many words at once forced me to actually find a structure to these words. In a while, I learned a lot about the underlying structure of English, which was a mind-expanding experience (certainly none of my teachers in India had come anywhere close to explaining such things, which in a way was nice for me because they left me a universe to discover for myself, but a pity for everyone else…).","I agree with the point raised by Benoit Cushman-Roisin that universities are ""prisoners of the system"" as they would appear to be lax if they ignore GRE. However, my point is that this should not be; if the big universities meet at a conference or something, and discuss and decide that they no longer would require GRE scores, then the prison is abolished. For instance, MIT does not require GRE, and they're doing fine.That said, even though the math section is really easy, I feel that there are some merits of the verbal section. For starters, the average American does not have difficulty in understanding English as it's their mother tongue. So to compete on a level ground when, say, attending lectures, giving talks or presentations in classrooms or conferences, or even doing TA duties, it is really essential that your English is not crude, but rather polished.Then, it also helps improve your vocabulary. The average American, and also British for that matter, knows a lot more words than the average person from non-English native speaking countries. Many of those 3000 words you refer to are already known by your American competitors. This means that they would write better, more articulate speeches, essays and sometimes even thesis. So how do you compete with them if you don't ""mug up"" those words? The GRE also tests your clarity and coherence of thought, which is essential in writing your papers and thesis.For these reasons, I think there should be an English test. And TOEFL does not incorporate all of these aspects. And as far as paying some agency to write your SoP, it does not work at the top universities; it might work at medium ranked universities though. This is because in the top schools, you need to explain the fine details of your past and future research, which is impossible to be done by a person not involved in similar research, let alone by a person not even from your field, which is what the agency people are likely to be. And besides, I would imagine universities have years of experience in dealing with these kind of fraudulent practices; so I guess they can figure most of them out from seemingly innocuous holes in their applications they didn't know existed.And as far as working with professors since their first year, what's wrong with that? It only means the student is aware of what it takes to get into top graduate schools, and is willing to work hard to get there. This is a positive thing in my opinion. With increasing population in the world, the bar will be raised as the competition stiffens. That is to be expected.And about having different tests for different disciplines, they do have the subject GRE, and some universities do require you to take it in some cases (for instance, if you want to pursue graduate study in a field different from the one you did your undergraduate studies in). However, I'm not sure if each and every field has a subject GRE or not; I know they scraped the Computer Science subject GRE a few years ago. This is probably because universities don't feel the requirement of a subject test, as they can test your research acumen from your past research, published papers and letters of recommendation."
GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients.

You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.You’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.You have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it. You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door. But, remember ‘freelancing job is also an actual job’. There’s nothing fancy about it until you make it.Before you are a freelancer you should prepare for being one. These is a simple road-map which you need to follow with determination, to make through this challenge.ACQUIRING SKILLS:This is the most important part. You need to acquire skills in whatever field you choose. You may find this boring and have an urge to jump over and look up to the offers. You may have misconceptions of having all necessary skills. But, this is the only way you can be successful in long run.Take a break to start an elaborated research in the chosen field and the specializations they demand.Look out for dummy projects to build a great portfolio. Offer to work with your peers, friends and nonprofit organizations for free.Keep a close look at people already in the industry and look up to their work. Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.MANAGING NETWORKSLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.Now that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.BEING THE BRANDThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.You need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help.

Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.THE ADVENTURE RIDENow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!Start looking out for jobs.

Should I take another course?”To that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.Of course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.Here are a few:You learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.There are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.It’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.You get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?Freelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.Bottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.And you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.If you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.On the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.Once you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.","Let’s start step by step:1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.If you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network.

At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.Include your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.If you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.3. Brand YourselfOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-Whether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.Along with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.Your logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.Most importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.The domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.Become a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.4. Understand the project requirement carefullyAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.The only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.9. Be ProfessionalWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-Starting date of projectThe project’s deadlineMilestonesFunctionalitiesSchedule meeting in priorMake the clear timeline of deliverables.Professionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–Keep Your Personal Life limited to yourselfYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.  It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.Charge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.Schedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.If some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.Build the right association.It is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.Follow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.Don’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.Be positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.10. Networking and Relationship with ClientsBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..Some useful techniques to grow your network.1. Increase your Social Media Network  Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.  2. Attend events You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.3. Speak at events Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event. 4. Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at. 5. Connect at co-working space You can share your desk with other freelancers from another field; this is the best way to enrich knowledge and network.  All points listed above reinforces you to become a freelancer, your perfect profile generation for freelance success and helps you in becoming your own boss with a promising career ahead."
GRE,"Apart from good GRE scores, what are the other credentials required to ensure admission to a top foreign university for an MS program?",https://www.quora.com//Apart-from-good-GRE-scores-what-are-the-other-credentials-required-to-ensure-admission-to-a-top-foreign-university-for-an-MS-program,"The GRE and Postgraduate University Admissions, Master's Programs and the Graduate Record Examination, Master's Programs Admissions, Master of Science in Computer Science, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Master of Science Degrees, Master's Programs, College and University Admissions, College Advice",41,"Note: You can follow my Quora blog for more info about higher education abroad: https://studyabroadgre.quora.com/SOP Evaluation here: SOP Evaluation procedure by Mihir on Study AbroadPS: Before I answer anything else, I will directly answer the question asked by most of the applicants: Can my GRE compensate for poor GPA/CGPA? The answer is NO. Now read everything below:GRE is not a big selection criterion for MS programs. The selection of a candidate for MS program is a 2 stage process:Screening process by the admin department: This screening process goes something like, there is a list of cut-off score or threshold values for certain selection criterion. For example, all students with GRE above 310 will be cleared, or all students with CGPA above 8.0/10.0 will be selected etc. This limit is not very strict and is flexible. TOEFL is one such criterion that will fall only and only in this screening process and not evaluated for the next one, unless you are going for TA/RA, in which case they need to evaluate your English language capability (still it will be least importance).Selection process by Adcom: In this process, you will be judged on your GPA, GRE score, SOP, LOR etc and is highly flexible. A student with great acads but not so good GRE can be selected over a student with perfect GRE score and average acads. It depends on your whole application file BUT certain parameters weigh more than the others.Usually the selection criterion goes like this (in descending order):Academic GPA/CGPA/%age as well as ranking in your batchUndergrad universitySOPResearch ex/Work exGRELORThese other factors will vary from case to case:Final Year ProjectInternship and papersCo/Extra-curricularProf LettingProblems people might face:BacklogsYear GapPlagiarismSome people may disagree, but this is what I personally think, seen and experienced.SELECTION CRITERION:1. Acads are the most important parameters:Your GPA or %age is the prime deciding factor. If you are topper in your batch and have shown outstanding academic performance, the chances are that you will be a preferable candidate for the program. Backlogs will damage your admission chances drastically. Although you can still find cases with a lot of backlogs and people still get admission in the university. Read this link at the end of the answer those who have low confidence in this area (he had 55 backlogs; read the whole thread/story).2. Undergrad University:If you belong to one of the top universities in your country, and you have descent acads, then you have good chances of admission. BEWARE, if you are from a top university BUT your acads are weak you will have a disadvantage compared to a student who is from a descent ranking university but high GPA. That's how it goes, 'Be on the top where ever you are', that's something to be learned not just for MS admission process but for life as well. :D3. Statement of Purpose (SOP):I personally feel that SOP is a big deciding factor in your admission. You can be a lot of different by writing an excellent SOP. Your SOP will say a lot of thing about you silently that a strong profile will never be able to speak out. SOP tells your attitude, your ambition, your clarity of thought and your personality. These sometime overweight excellent profiles. This video will help you realize the importance of a good SOP (UMass Amherst Admission Committee):Also if you want to read more about it, check the link at the end of the answer.4. Work/Research ex, GRE and LOR:I will prefer not to rank them in a strict order because they will depend on the type of program you are applying to. If you are applying for a research based program, your research/work ex and LOR will be of higher value than GRE, but if may be it is not a specifically research based MS program, then if is possible that GRE may matter more. A good GRE score will certainly help. Score above 310 is considered okay-okay.... may be descent... 320+ is desirable and good... 330+ is excellent. AWA also matters and 3.0+ is almost like mandatory... 4/4+ is good. Work/research ex is helpful not just during MS application process but also after completing your MS when job hunting. A relevant work ex is recommended and good, but if you have work ex in a different field than what you are going to study, no promises can be made if it will help.If you are interested in doing some research work and gain some research experience before applying for MS you can apply as RA at IITs under a prof. Here are some details on that: http://www.edulix.com/forum/show... LORs are important mainly for PhD programs. they do add some weight to the application, but only if a prominent professor from a premier institute or a high ranking official from work place writes it. It is also important to send the LOR only using the official university/company mail id of the prof/boss, else although acceptable, they will add ZERO points to application.Finally I will add the uncertainty factor: LUCK. :D Although they say ""The harder I work, the luckier I get.""Update: To include all the rest of the factors involved in the admission process.THESE FACTORS WILL VARY FROM CASE TO CASE:1. Final Year Project (FYP):Check this too: Mihir Gupta's answer to Which kind of project should I do so that I can show it in my resume for MS in US? This is also one of the important deciding factors for admission, especially for one applying for MS with thesis. It will demonstrate your ability to convert your theoretical know-how into practical engineering knowledge. Also if your project is good enough, you can get a paper out of it and publish it. Sometimes, if he admission process involves an interview with a prof who is willing to take you as RA/TA, then the FYP is very important as mos of the interview questions will be from the project.2. Internships and Papers:Internship that are usually undertaken by B.Tech students in 3rd or 4th year matter only if they project assigned to them is a good one and it they do it from a reputed firm like IISC, DRDO, or some big pvt companies. Here the important thing will also be to work for a longer time as one month's internship won't be of any use. If you work for a minimum 3 months and are also able to impress your boss such that he is willing to give you recommendation, that will be the best case scene. It is also possible to try score internships abroad in a university or a company. They are a big plus for overall profile.Research papers published during the final year project or internship will help those who wish to go for MS with thesis option but not very much for students aiming for MS without thesis (MEngg; 1 yr course). The impact factor of the journal you have published your work in will be considered, but not much as adcom do not expect a high quality research work from an undergrad unless it is a direct PhD application.3. Co/Extra-curricular:These activities will not offer you any major advantage, but will make your resume/CV look bright and show that you are involved in activities other than acads. If you do not have good acads and bad GRE, then these activities will be of zero importance, on the other hand if you profile is good and you have done some nice activities, then these will provide you an edge over student who has profile similar to yours.4. Prof-Letting:This is useful only when you think you have good admission chances and that you want to work under a prof as RA/TA under a prof during MS. For this the credentials responsible will differ. Of course acads will still hold importance, but after that will come your work ex, research ex, papers, project and LOR. There is a method required to contact profs of the desired university. You can read all about it in the link at the end of the answer.PROBLEMS PEOPLE MIGHT FACE:1. Backlogs:Don't feel disappointed if you have had a few backlogs. Although your list of universities will be a bit different compared to the one who had no backlogs, but you still do have a good chance to succeed. For this I will again link you to this guy who had 55 backlogs and still got admit and visa as well. All you need is strong motivation, hard work and will power.Backlog in a core subject, the one you are selecting your specialization for MS will hurt bad, but if it is in an unrelated subject, it will probably not be that bad.2. Year Gap:If you completed your UG in 2012 and did nothing till June 2013, then it will be called a year gap. If you worked for a major part of that year (6/6+ months) then its not probably not a year gap.Some year gaps are acceptable. Like you took a year off to work in an NGO or may be for (Teach For India) TFI or something like that, then it is acceptable.The other case may be that you were preparing for GATE or any other exam. This will be a negative factor for your profile unless you did great in that exam and that exam somehow added to your profile (like good GATE score is valuable for German universities).The third case can be that you were search for job and by the end you decided to take GRE for MS. This will have really bad effect on your profile, unless you can cover it with something valuable you might have done side by side.3. Plagiarism:This is kind of an indirect factor that may affect your chances of admit, BUT if found guilty, you may not just receive reject from the university you applied to but also from other universities you are going to apply to. Plagiarism is a serious issue when it comes to higher studies.

More importantly, once you achieve something around 167 and above in quant and 160 and above in Verbal, even GRE does not matter. These days a lot of Indian students are applying with GRE scores of 325+, so I do not think GRE will pull you up, unless you get 335+ (but anything less than 315 will pull you down).What matters --1) CGPA (higher the CGPA better are your chances. Anything with 9 pointer above will be a good bet).2) Rank (if your university of college gives you a recognised rank then say your CGPA is 8, but still you are second in class, then it shall help your case).3) Name of the institute. Better recongized is your institute, better are your chances. For example: names such as IIT, NIT or BITS do hold value.4) Internships -- If you have internship at IIT or some other good US university, then you have brighter chances of achieving an admission. If you have internships at top multinationals (such as for CS guys microsoft, IBM labs, intel, samsung and so on) then also you can secure a good MS program. Your internship at a startup can also help you, if the work done is good. The main point to understand is at the end of the day, work matters.5) If you have research papers or some academic awards or grants, then it will help you pass through a good MS program. Publishing researh papers does not mean that a person publishes 10 papers, but the conference or journal is not even recognized. Even if you have a single paper, but from a reputed organization, then it is far better than ten.6) Contacts with foreign univeristy profesor. If you have any interaction with the professor of the college of your choice, then you have an edge.7) SOP -- A golden rule, write the truth and not stories. State your achivements and your study plans, group to join and professor to work with.PS: Thanx to Nikhil Prabhu for edits","Dear GRE aspirant,Do you think that modest GRE scores and backlogs would hold back a profile? No, definitely not.To help you in understanding this claim better, I have a chart* with three GREedge alumni with modest GRE scores and backlogs.*Data obtained from GREedge’s Admission Counselling TeamSo, these profiles are indeed testimony to the fact that apart from your GRE score, a host of other factors determine the status of your admits. Now that you know this, I’m sure you are wondering what these factors are. Based on my experience as the Co-founder of GREedge, I would like to share them with you.Before you get to these factors, you must know the application process to know how universities shortlist candidates. This would give you a background of what universities look for in a prospective candidate. A general flow of the application process would look like this:Over the evaluation process, Universities, in general, look to scrutinize you on a holistic basis.The evaluation begins by examining your CGPA and a host of other factors. Some of these factors include the scores of your admission requirement tests, Letter of Recommendation, Statement of Purpose/essay among the rest. So, clearly understand what universities use as a sieve in screening your application.Most universities have some common filters. Some of them include:Competitive GPA: Once your application package reaches the university, it is immediately forwarded to the Graduate Department. The first scrutiny that is made on the application is the “test of your GPA”. Your GPA speaks volumes about your application. If you are a rank-holder or if you have a consistent academic track record, then you can definitely expect some weightage. Countries like the U.S. and Germany place a huge emphasis on GPAs. For example, Georgia Tech requires an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better to pursue a Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (MS-HCI). Though you cannot completely balance your profile with high GPA, a consistent and competitive GPA will definitely add substantial value to your profile. In addition to your GPA, the following academic factors will give your application an edge too.TOEFL/IELTS: A great deal of emphasis is placed on your IELTS or TOEFL score apart from your GRE score. Most universities require a good TOEFL or IELTS score. For example, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, requires a minimum of 90 points in the Internet-based TOEFL (iBT). Georgia Tech, on the other hand, for the MS-HCI program, requires a minimum of 100 in TOEFL. Universities emphasize on TOEFL/IELTS scores to determine the status of TA/RA. Further, IELTS and TOEFL scores are also taken into account in determining the quantum of your scholarships and fellowships. Keep it a point to research on the minimum requirements. A TOEFL score over 100 or IELTS score over 7 will indeed add value to your profile.Letter of Recommendation: The basic purpose of the Letter of Recommendation is to get a person to vouch for your credentials. This, no doubt, adds value to your profile. Ensure that you get two or three Letters of Recommendation. The Letter of Recommendation must come from someone who has been associated with you. It can be your university professor or your senior at workplace. Further, it will also add value if the person who recommends you has a PhD. So, make it a point to get a commendable Letter of Recommendation and this will indeed boost the value of your profile.Statement of Purpose: Your SOP is just like your personal interview with the Admission Committee. Convey all that you want the Admission Committee to know about your profile.Your Statement of Purpose must be genuine and convincing. Make it a point to highlight the drive behind your Master’s program. Answer all possible questions, such as:1. Your degree of interest in your chosen field 2. What made you apply for the particular university 3. Why did you choose the particular courseEnsure that you don’t leave out any relevant information. Make it a point to highlight all your academic achievements and professional goals. Always remember that your SOP is as good as an interview. So, draft a compelling SOP that would persuade the Admission Committee to consider your profile.You can keep the following guidelines in your mind while you draft your SOP:Paper Publication and Research Work: Having a good number of paper publications and research work will show that you had been in touch with the academic community. Ensure that you have your papers published in international journals. Also, if you had participated in international conferences, ensure that you highlight them. A good number of paper publications and research work will indeed add points to your applications. So, even if you have not published any papers until now, get started with it. Paper publications and research work add a high impact to your profile.Work Experience: Work experience will be a crucial factor in adding value to your profile. Two or three years of relevant experience will add precious points to your profile. Further, it will also be a good source for your Letter of Recommendation. Though work experience is not a mandatory requirement, relevant work experience in a reputed company will add value.Project and Internships: Your project and internships will definitely be considered while your application is evaluated. The degree of your practical knowledge and research acumen can be demonstrated through projects and internships. So, highlight your projects and internships. Make it a point to highlight your projects and internships in an appropriate manner.Apart from these factors, you can certainly highlight your co-curricular and extracurricular activities too. They will also be considered since they throw light on your overall personality.Though there is no set order of priority in evaluating a candidate’s profile, you can indeed make a huge impact if you can balance out your profile. So, have a balanced profile and try not to compromise on any element. Remember that universities look for candidates with a holistic profile and not someone with unilateral strength. This will indeed make all the difference.All the best!","Studying abroad: it’s something we all have dreamt about at some point, isn’t it? The prospect of moving to a strange country, meeting new friends and living independently cannot fail to excite anyone.

Here’s a glimpse at some of the top Canadian universities that accept GRE scores, and their respective GRE requirements:Download the ebook GRE Cutoff Scores for Top 35 UniversitiesTOEFL/IELTS score: Both the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) are accepted at universities in Canada, Germany and the US, and seek to assess your command and fluency over the English language. Your ability to read, write, speak and listen comfortably in English will be gauged, and a score will be given accordingly. In countries apart from USA, this lays a very important role in the admission committee’s mind as it gives a reflection of your communication abilities. In the TOEFL iBT (Internet Based Test), each of the four sections will be marked between 0 to 30 for a possible total score of 120. On the IELTS, marks are allotted between 0 to 9, with 0.5 increments. You will be given an individual band score for each skill, in addition to an overall score. A good TOEFL score is anything between 100 to 120, while a score of 7.5 and above is generally regarded as a good IELTS score. While the IELTS enjoys a worldwide acceptance, the TOEFL is generally used in the US, although all American universities also accept IELTS scores. Owing to its versatility, IELTS scores are valid in over 10,000 institutions and universities worldwide, including countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany.Download eBook: A Definitive Guide for IELTS hereAcademic GPA: One of the most crucial factors that impact your admission chances would be your GPA referred to as CGPA or percentages in a lot of Indian Institutions. Given the fact that a student’s CGPA does not completely reflect the student’s potential but to a certain extent about the faculty, college & competition in the university, it’s seen as a relative criterion. To explain in simple words, your GPA is considered as good or bad depending on your topper’s GPA. Also, each country requires your to convert your GPA to scale of 4. Read about how to convert your GPA for USA, Canada & Germany here>>Statement of Purpose: The Statement of Purpose, or the SOP, is a crucial ingredient to a successful application. Because universities abroad typically receive hundreds of applications with similar credentials, your SOP is your one chance to showcase your individuality and your dreams and aspirations, and set yourself apart from your peers. The SOP is commonly thought to be a replacement for the personal interview, and for that reason, it is crucial that you nail it just right. For the lowdown on how to craft the perfect winning SOP, make sure you checkout our top tips and tricks!Download ebook: How To Craft A Winning SOP >>Letters of Recommendation: Written by former professors or employers, the LOR is an important testament to your intellectual and personal character, and is essentially a promise from one professor to another that you are an intelligent, diligent student, and deserving of an admit. Ideally, you should get LORs from professors who have supervised your thesis or research project, Heads of Departments, or from professors who have taught you and known you for a substantial period of time, especially if they are well-known in their field and have published extensively. You can also submit LORs from employers, although it is recommended you only do this if you’ve been out of college for a few years.Work and research experience: As a fresh undergraduate, you aren’t typically expected to have work experience apart from the usual internship or voluntary work. However, if you do have such experience, make sure to highlight it in your CV and SOP. Most applicants tend to apply to graduate school straight after finishing undergrad, and view work experience as a filler, but work experience not only allows you to gain a fresh perspective on the world, but also facilitates the development of new, life-defining skills, and the ability to work in and lead diverse groups of people, all of which are paramount to graduate applications. As far as research is concerned, do remember, universities in the US are vastly different from Indian ones, especially because of the onus they place on research and development, to the extent where applicants with a relatively lower GPA have won admits to top schools based purely on their excellent research experience in the past. If you have substantial research experience, it would be a good idea to get your research supervisors to write you a reference letter, and also issue you any relevant certificates. Both research and work experience are especially beneficial in making up for any shortfalls in you GPA or GRE scores, and also in getting scholarships and other aid.What are the common mistakes students make while applying?Time, as they say, is money, and this is especially true for MS applications, where every single day is of prime importance. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that you plan your application well in advance and follow a proper timeline so that you don’t find yourself floundering for time. So what are some of the mistakes that trip up study abroad aspirants? Let’s take a look:Starting GRE preparation late: Your GRE, as we mentioned, is one of the most important building blocks of your application, so ideally, you must give yourself sufficient time to start preparing for the test, so you can identify your weak points and work on them properly. You also need to have enough time so that if you find your GRE scores unsatisfactory, you can choose to rewrite it.Inability to shortlist universities: Of course, Harvard, MIT and Caltech are the dream of millions, but realistically, is your profile compatible with the stringent requirements of these universities? Before applying, draw up a list of 8-10 universities you would like to attend, based on criteria such as GRE requirements, tuition fee, acceptance rate, past admits, alum profiles, cultural & research field compatibility with faculty etc. Remember, you will be spending quite a bit on application fees, so make sure you don’t waste time and money on schools that are unrealistically out of your league.Download The SELECT Strategy to Shortlist Universities eBOOK hereLacking the relevant details about deadlines and requirements: Universities in the US and Canada are extremely strict about the application deadlines: for instance, for fall admit, applications usually close in the first week of December of the previous year. Many aspirants often fail to take cognizance of deadlines, or neglect to send in their applications keeping in mind the time it would take to reach the US. A good idea is to note down the application deadlines of the various programs you want to apply to, well in advance. Do remember that if you are applying for a scholarship, deadlines are typically earlier. Additionally, many schools have an early bird round, which closes much before the usual deadlines. Applying in an early bird round greatly improves your chances at an offer letter, so if you’re ready, you can send in your applications right in time for that!Consulting unofficial/inaccurate/random websites: The internet is a quagmire of information, and it is easy to fall into a trap of misinformation if you are not careful. While researching for application information, be sure to stick to only the university’s official websites. If you are still doubtful or have any questions, be sure to write to the admissions help desk of the university to be sure.Sending an incomplete or inadequate application: Applying overseas is not as straightforward as applying to universities in India: there is a lot more paperwork involved, such as healthcare insurance, transcripts, and visas, and in order to prevent your application from being summarily rejected, you need to ensure that your application package is complete. Overwhelmed?Don’t worry. Please find the MS application checklist right below to help you plan your entire application process.Download the eBOOK “MS Admit: The Application Checklist” hereWe hope you found this information useful, and now have some clarity on the various building blocks to ensuring an offer letter to your dream university.

GRE,What are some tips to be followed to join MS course in US through GRE?,https://www.quora.com//What-are-some-tips-to-be-followed-to-join-MS-course-in-US-through-GRE,"Master of Science Degree Admissions and the Graduate Record Examination, Master's Programs and the Graduate Record Examination, Master's Programs in the United States of America, Higher Education in the United States of America, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Master of Science Degrees, Master's Programs",7,"In order to pursue MS in a particular course in the United States of America one must give the GRE and TOEFL. We need to understand that everyone dreams to pursue higher education in the US and hence our chances for admission in a top 20 university are really slim.GRE and TOEFL are not the only criteria under which we get admission into a good college. There are many more criteria’s under which the college authorities judge us. Education system in the US is very different from the education system in India, For example; they grade their student on a 4 point GPA scale and follow a relative grading system also they give very high priority to hand on job experience. To put into context I will enlist some of the must have qualities that you need to get into a Top 20 college in the US.  1. A good CGPA or percentage in your Undergraduate: As we all must know that the GRE does not have subject specific test and hence your CGPA is the only thing that reflects your knowledge in a particular subject. (This might be overlooked if you do your masters from your home country or you have been working after completing your graduate school)  2. High GRE score. A score of 325+ is required in order secure admission into a top college. Your GRE score reflects your aptitude and command on English knowledge that is very vital to survive in a cut throat competition.  3. High TOEFL score. A TOEFL score of 100+ is considered very decent, and can easily get you into a top 20 college in the US. Your TOEFL score might also get you fellowship and scholarship. (More info in provided in the coming sections).  4. Internship/Job Experience.   If you are applying in a US university directly after your graduation then you must have decent amount of internship certificates. Recently I read a study in Economics Times regarding how Ivy league colleges are providing special acknowledgement to those who have had working experience in a start up (Does not matter if it was successful or not). I would suggest you to get as much internship as you can in MNC/NGO/Start-Up.  If you have already passed out your graduate school and currently working then I would suggest you to get minimum of 2 years of experience. But if you have been working in a company for 7-8 years then your chances to get into these universities get a bit low, as with age people to tend to be rigid and are a bit difficult to train.  5. Recommendation letter and Statement of purpose: These are only viewed by the college you applied in once you have impressed them by your CV and academics.   Many people tend to copy their SOP or get it written by someone else. It is very important to understand that all top universities have their interview rounds and they might ask you about your SOP, and it is better to write your SOP on your own rather than getting embarrassed in front of your professors. Writing your SOP is really easy, all you need to do is tell them why you want to join a particular university, trust me the more truthful you are the better it reflects to them.  Moving onto the Letter of recommendation part, this is more like a certification from your seniors (At Workplace), Professors from your regular college and Professors from any summer/winter school you attended. I wouldn’t go into detail for this section as it is really easy to get a letter of recommendation in countries like India etc.  Apart from the qualities mention above there are many more qualities you must have (But are secondary) in order to land your dream college. Some of those qualifications are, 1. Sports participation in inter college competition  2. Certification from a reputed institution in a musical instrument or vocals. etc   I wouldn’t go into the details of every aspect of your application, but will surely try to provide useful insight to the important aspects   Now it is really important for you to understand how to ace the GRE , for that lets look at the pattern of the examination.GRE consists of 2 sections ie 1. Quantitative section deals with basic and general mathematics that we were taught in high school and it requires a strong conceptual knowledge in the subject. To master the quantative section you need to practice the basic mathematics i.e. Math’s of class 11 and 12. But in GRE only the basic conceptual application based problems are asked and I would suggest you to really get some help from a institute that provide proper GRE coaching/training. IF you have a good basics in mathematics then I suggest you to avoid going to any classes and simply buy a correspondence package from some reputed institute. The pattern of GMAT CAT and GRE is very different so please don’t try to practice from any book, Plan and work.   2. The verbal section involves grammar, reading comprehensions and vocabulary knowledge. Verbal section is very important for students applying for grants and fellowship in order to get funding for their education abroad. A high verbal score provides the university with a sense that yes the candidate has a decent command over the language and can be a useful resource to a professor. Mastering the verbal section though could be a really tough job as our first language is not English, But don’t worry I have the solution for you.  Don’t just mug up the words, plan and work.   Steps to learn new words in effective manner  1.Pickup reading material that excites you let it be newspaper, books, novels or whatever.  2. Mark the words that you find foreign and jot them down. 3. Try to identify the roots of the words. 4. Later try to find the meaning of these words on your own in terms of the context you read and literal meaning in dictionary.  Now to learn the roots I would suggest you to refer to book by “Norman Lewis” called “Word power made easy”. But just learning the roots is not enough you need to learn its application and for that I suggest you to download the app VOLT – Vocabulary Learning Technique. And it is made by IIT and IIM alumni; the app has many great features that will help you.   Some of them are,   1.Pictorial representation of the word ( In the sense it can be used ) explained correct meaning 2.Provision of synonym and antonyms of every word, its usage in sentence , pronunciation of the word in both verbal track and written (break down of the word) .  3. The app has numerous words which can be learnt and are used in our day to day lives.  4. If you are going to give your GRE exam in 2-3 months then this app is bible for you, as in less time you will be able to learn the most probable words that could be asked in you exam   The App provides with pictures that represent the word. Visual representation leaves maximum impression on our brain and hence makes it very easy to learn new words.  But the best usage of VoLT can only be taken if you practice the words regularly in your daily life and apply them as much as you can. Else it’s just mugging up words that will lead you nowhere.   The above mentioned technique will not only help you in your GRE only but also will be an indispensible tool in preparation of your TOEFL exam. I have seen people prepare for their TOEFL in just 2 days and score 100+, but this is a very risky method to follow and is only suitable for people who have given their GRE as they have already worked on their English skills.   Moving onto to the other aspects of your application, getting internship is a really vital part of it.  Following are the ways you can get a good internship with good job profile  1. If you are a fresher then I would suggest you to download apps like Internshala, Linked in etc. These have posting from companies ranging from MNC’s to NGO to startups. Fresher’s are usually hired by startup companies in the field of marketing, content writing and sales. As you have already read how working at a Startup might help you I would definitely recommend you to apply in your winter and summer breaks.  2. If you are in your second year of graduation, I would recommend you to go to specific websites of the companies who are the market leaders in your study field and apply in the career section of these website. For example, in Economics; if you are in 2nd year I would recommend you to apply in companies like E&Y, Delloite etc. You would be surprised to know how active they are in providing internship in various fields. This will prove to be very helpful for you in the future even if you don’t pursue MS and just sit for placement from your college.  3. If you have already passed out from college then I would suggest you to go for job profile over salary. Always keep in mind the field of study in which you are going to apply for MS and what you currently are working on, else it will be very difficult to explain them in your SOP about how you developed interest in the field that you want to pursue and applying in.  Your GRE score is valid for 5 years so don’t rush into things; Universities only want the cream of every field. Try to be best in the country and consider meeting a career counselor as they would provide you with tailor made lists of universities that you should apply in (According to you CV and profile)Make sure to check out our app VOLT on Google play store. It now has over 1.1 lakh downloads and has amazing cool features that will make your verbal section easy and interestingVoLT: Vocabulary Learning Technique , helps student prepare for Verbal and Vocabulary section of competitive exam.Link for download VoLT - Vocabulary Learning - Android Apps on Google Play","I am copying my answer to same kind of question.First thing first - Get your PASSPORT if you don’t have it yet.Join this FB group - MS in US - Fall 2016 | stupidsid.com. Keep following this group. You will get information, contacts, students going/applying to same universities from this group.Keep your grades as high as you can and try to avoid backlogs as much as you can.(Those play significant role in admission)Focus your free time into projects, internship, tech. competitions as much as you can. (Ex., summer internship at top colleges in India/abroad, robotics events, SAE SUPRA/ BAJA). (You will need this to get scholarship in safe universities and admission in ambitious university).Also if you get certificate for any type community services (ex. teaching village kids, distributing food and clothes etc.) from some NGO then that will help a lot as well.Keep very good relations with faculties who are either have higher positions (ex. HOD) or with PHD degrees (from reputed colleges if possible). (This will help a lot while getting LORs from prof. Greater the reputation of faculty recommending you better the effect on admission.)Start preparing your SOP (Statement of purpose). Make sure to right your every important achievement and your thinking towards making world better. Also right about “Why this course?” to prove you are passionate about it. Google some SOPs and you will get the idea.Get three LORs (Letter of recommendation) from 3 different professors. Make sure to take LORs signed and stamped on college letter head and also make soft copies of all LORs before you seal them into college envelop(in most of the universities your respective professor will have to upload soft copies of signed and stamped LORs online.) (Generally people prepare 10 sets of LORs if they are planning to apply in 5-7 uni. to be on safer side).Get 10 original transcripts from your college in special envelop with your college symbol on it. Have original transcript scanned soft copy as well.Get 10 sets of all your college mark sheets, provisional degree/original degree true copied from your college registrar.Get 10 sets of 10th and 12th mark sheets true copied from your school principal.In last year start preparing for GRE. If you are a student who comes in “above the average” category then you can prepare by yourself otherwise better to have classes to prepare for it. For this exam you need to be good in particularly 2 things - MATHS & ENGLISH. GRE fees - 195 $. GRE score is valid for 5 year but most of uni. consider max up to 2 years old score only so plan according to that.Once you clear GRE then start preparing for TOEFL/IELTS exam. This exams are compulsory to prove your efficiency in ENGLISH in READING, SPEAKING, WRITING & LISTENING. Both exams has almost same course and pattern. Most of universities in USA accepts both scores (TOEFL/IELTS) but if you want to keep open a door for MS in CANADA as well then go for IELTS only. TOEFL fees- 170$, IELTS fees- 11,100 RS.Once you got your GRE & TOEFL/IELTS scores in hand you can start shortlisting universities. People generally applies to 5–7 universities but there is no limit. Different universities have their own application fees. It can cost around 7000–10000 rs. to apply in 7 university. Some universities let you apply freely as well. Now the main question comes “how to shortlist universities?”. Well you can use YOCKET app, Stupid Sid website, edulix, experience of seniors, etc. Use scores, ranking, reputation, budget of fees, etc to short list universities.Start applying to universities, you can apply by yourself or you can choose a consultancy for it. But you have to be well researched and careful while applying by yourself. Many universities will ask financial documents, just to confirm that you can afford the fees. (These financial documents will be help full in VISA process as well.)After applying online its time to courier the true copied/ original documents to respective universities. Some uni. demands hard copies some don’t. Use edulix courier scheme(~825 rs /courier) or Stupidsid courier scheme (~900 rs/ courier). These are the cheapest and most reliable schemes available for courier. Google it and you will find a webpage for these schemes.Wait for the decisions of universities. As soon as you start getting admission you will start getting I 20 form from respective universities(These I 20 documents are very important, don’t loose them).Once you decide for university and you got I 20 for that uni. then you will have to take VISA appointment on suitable date by paying 160$. Before going for VISA interview you will have to pay SEVIS fees of 200$ as well.Prepare necessary documents and answers for general questions asked in Visa Interview. Go for the VISA interview. Once you get the VISA then book your flights ticket.You can not go to USA earlier than 30 days of your college start date. Generally people go 15–20 days early. Sometimes it is wiser to book tickets even if your VISA interview is not done because ticket cancellation charges range from 5000–10000 rs. and price of tickets increase 6000–10000 every one or two weeks.thanks for the edit Apoorva SureshEdit 2- I had added some points those I forgot to mention before.Edit 3- Some links of books and apps that are useful in preparation of GRE.GRE Magoosh , GRE Magoosh Flash CardsKaplan GREBarrons GRE","Looking back I feel there were some things that if I had known before I would have taken some different decisions:1. If you get admission in a reputed but expensive college and you have partial scholarship or even no scholarship; I would say go for it. I know for someone coming from a middle class background and taking a huge loan doesn’t seem like a good idea ; but my point is once you get a job you can repay that amount in a year or so easily. Getting a degree from a good college matters a lot, because even your compensation will be more compared to someone graduating from an average college.2. When choosing courses take tough courses which will teach you a lot and not courses which will give you good grades but doesn’t add much to your knowledge. Remember these courses are expensive so make it worth your money. This might be difficult for some of us coming from Indian education system where we give more importance to grades than to education experience. You might get a lower grade but make sure to get your concepts right; you will understand the importance when you are giving interviews at big companies like Google, Microsoft etc.3. Work for at least a year after graduating from your Bachelors; it gives you crucial experience based on which you can make your future decisions. Many people find out that they were not meant for this technical field and it’s better to do something else, like MBA or MIS. Others will find out if they like a particular branch more than others and decide to do specialization (MS or PhD) in that area.4. MBA vs MS: Like I mentioned in the previous point, working after you graduate will help you in making this decision. If after working for a year you find that you enjoy working in technical field and you see yourself in this field in the next 5-10 years at least then go for MS. If you find out that you don’t like the technical field you are in and want to completely change the direction than go for MBA.","Thanks for A2A!Well, GRE isn’t the only factor considered by the admission committees and you need to have an overall good profile to get into top universities.Let me give you some tips for GRE,Write as many mock tests as you can! GRE isn’t always about getting the answers right, it can be a strenuous exam wherein your brain has to be active through out the exam (3.5+ hours). In simple, Practice matters!Most people take the AWA part easily. I would suggest you to practice 4–5 essays before your actual test. Also, when you take your mock tests, don’t skip the AWA part! Remember, AWA can be tiring and can take a toll on the quants, verbal sections too without proper practice.Make use of Flash Cards for verbal, it helped me! With respect to quants, focus on your weak points and solve using a timer.With respect to TOEFL, you can follow notefull videos and they should be pretty much helpful!Apart from GRE, TOEFL focus on your GPA, Projects, Publications, Work exp if any, SOP, LORs etc at the time of applying. Also, try to apply in the priority deadlines of universities!Hope this helps! All the very best!"

You can score anywhere from 130 to 170 which means that the number of possible scores that can be obtained are limited to just 41.

I've heard an admissions committee member of a top 10 University say this: ""All Indians get high scores in GRE, and excellent recommendation letters, and well written SOPs. We don't know why, and we don't care. If the candidate's GRE score is good, and recommendation letters and SOP are good, we just ignore both of those and use other criteria. If any of those are not up to the mark, we reject the candidate.""So what criteria are actually used?Preference is given to colleges in India that the selection committee members have heard of.If a student from college X with GPA/Percentage Y does well in the university, then the university starts regularly taking students with GPA greater than Y from college X. (Of course, if the student does badly, they'll increase the cutoff percentage, or worse yet, stop taking students from X.)Occasionally, they take a chance on an unheard of (for them) college, and admit someone based on a strong resume. That person pretty much holds the fate of the future students of that college in his hands.So your best bet is to apply to universities where your seniors have gone before.","First of all if you are aiming top 10 universities in United States here are a couple of links that might interest you the most throughout this hectic and exhausting process How To Get Into Stanford & Other Graduate Schools and Helping You Get Into Your Dream School (This is supposed to be authored by the famous Stanford university professor Andrew Ng) and will help you the most in the process.Coming to the question I was fortunate to attend a conference organized by Welcome to USIEF ::(United States Indian Educational Foundation) last year regarding the admissions process where delegates from around 100 universities came over to Delhi to enlighten students regarding the different disciplines at the university, the admission criteria, visa application and other supplemental stuff. I posed the following question to one of the delegates in the committee, ""What criteria does a university use to normalize profiles of students who have done great at academics, Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and TOEFL but have practically no internship experience, bad projects etc against those who have scored modestly in GRE and TOEFL have secured a bearable percentage of marks and have strong internship, international and competitive flavor to their profile?"". And to my delight the answer I got was a positive one, He told that university only requires a student to score the minimal GRE and TOEFL scores that renders the student eligible to apply to the university and after this initial screening is done the application is passed on to a committee of students and professors where the profile is grilled and brownie points are given for the student's outstanding achievements and then there is a weight to weight comparison of profiles between students who managed to pass the initial screening, keeping this in mind I would say try to score well in GRE but even if you don't manage very high scores don't get discouraged you must ensure that you manage a score so that you pass the initial screening phase of your application and as far as top 10 universities in States are concerned the only thing that matters is you and your achievements and most importantly the people from whom you manage to get your Letters of Recommendation, if those people are well known in their respective fields the other parts of your application might just play very little role, and if the recommendation is strong then I do believe it will be an admit in most of the cases.Conclusion : Strive hard to manage both good scores and most importantly build a good profile for which you can participate in internationally recognized events, collaborative research experience will do a world of good, and other such extracurricular activities. Best of Luck.","Getting into top universities of US is really a big challenge…GRE Scores for Top US Universities -Every school has its own set of requirements. There are U.S. universities that accept students with very low or no GRE scores, while others require scores above 330. o stop looking for the general GRE cutoff score requirements and start learning how universities accept international students.If you believe that all U.S. colleges and universities have an average GRE cutoff score, well you are very wrong. Each school may or may not disclose their minimum GRE score required for admission. The same condition applies to academic percentage, GMAT score, etc.Some universities have minimum TOEFL scores required for admission.Generally, a total of 320 or more in GRE, and at least, 161 in the quantitative section, can fetch a candidate admission in one of the top universities in the US. The GRE scores would differ depending upon the school you choose. Again, within a particular university / school, it would vary depending upon the field you select.Average TOEFL scoreEnglish proficiency is an important factor in successful admission. The students are therefore advised to work in this area for better chances of selection.Average TOEFL score required is 90 generally.. Still some top universities accept as low as 76 and some universities demands for even 100 or 100 + as well. So it totally varies from school to school and the particular course you are applying.Other than GRE and TOEFL.. Important components required to enter into top universities of USAExceptional GPA - Some universities choose to waive off the GRE score if your grade point average is above 3.4 on a scale of 0 to 4. So it pays to focus on your undergraduate degree and achieving an excellent GPA.Work Experience - Some universities waive off the GRE/GMAT if you have relevant work-experience of four years or more that is closely related to the degree that you aim to study.Strong SOP - Your SOP has the power to make or break your application. Universities treat SOP very seriously and they read your SOP. It is very important you write a good Statement of purpose interweaving your goals, your achievements, how will you achieve your goals and what do you really want to accomplish in life, etc. Statement of purpose gives the admission committee to judge your perspective of life, your career aspirations, your ethics, your technical aptitude, your vision for life, etc. The key point is, it is your chance to explain to admission committee why you are going for higher education and what is your main purpose…Universities give utmost importance to SOP.LOR - Often Universities refer to your Letters of Recommendations as a validation of what all achievements you have written about in your resume. Also, they serve as a proof positive of your work in an organization or your tenure in a college as the LORs are often requested on the official letterheads.Hope you found this article useful and informative…"
GRE,"Why do we often hear about perfect SAT scores, but never about perfect GRE scores?",https://www.quora.com//Why-do-we-often-hear-about-perfect-SAT-scores-but-never-about-perfect-GRE-scores,"The GRE and Postgraduate University Admissions, SAT and University Admissions, SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test), Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, College and University Admissions",15,"Because at the time of grad school application, the tests matter much less in comparison to grades and recommendations, the candidate pool is much stronger (and thus differentiation in test scores translates poorly to differentiation in candidate quality), and a perfect GRE is very rare on account of the verbal. So you're unlikely to meet someone with a perfect GRE, and if you did, it wouldn't mean very much.There's also a big difference between the verbal and the math. A perfect GRE math is actually common among STEM applicants, and for top schools, a near-perfect GRE math is almost a requirement to make it past the initial round of application review and get your application in front of the eyes actual professors. This is because the GRE math is easy for STEM students, since it doesn't really test anything beyond basic high school math. There is almost no ability to differentiate between top students using the GRE math, since everyone bunches up at 170 (800 on the old scale).The verbal, on the other hand, is very difficult to get a perfect score. Only philosophy majors seem to do well, with 4.8% getting a perfect score, and English majors at about 2%, and almost all other majors well below 1%. Compare that with STEM, where most majors seem to land about 5-10% at a perfect score. So the verbal score is more of a bottleneck to a perfect overall GRE than the math.Moreover, there isn't a great overlap between majors that score perfectly on verbal and those that score perfectly on math. Perfect verbal for STEM majors is super rare, but also nearly useless for STEM grad schools. Therefore a perfect all around GRE has little signal value, it's just about the math. I'm not sure how it is for humanities applicants, but I imagine that acing the math does little for your application (and my guess is that acing the verbal is also not much of an addition to an application). So a perfect GRE just doesn't mean very much at the grad level.The SAT on the other hand, is given at a stage when students are expected to be generalists, and undergrad applicants are admired for their well-roundedness, and recommendations from high school contacts carry much less weight. There isn't much else to go on in the application basket, so a standardized test given to all applicants provides a reasonable source if differentiation.","GRE and SAT are very different in exam structure, difficulty and relevance. It isn't a surprise that they have a huge difference when it comes to scoring. There are basically 3 main reasons for it.The Typical population : About 1.7 million people take the SAT every year while just about 580 thousand people take the GRE. Now, surveys denote that almost all the students who attempt the SATs use the SAT Score for their admissions i.e. they are serious about it. While a huge chunk of people who take the GRE, also take the GMAT hence making the serious population thinner.The Typical Colleges : Typically almost all top undergraduate programs which ask for the SAT Score want a perfect or a near perfect scorer as their intake. While the isnt the case for the GRE taking grad schools. They have an amazing amount of other parameters to look for while deciding their ideal student so the GRE score gets somewhat sidelined. Hence making it a sub-standard requirement which in turn makes the occurrence if a perfect GRE Score scarce.GRE is tougher : To be honest this reason is not that predominant as the above too but is still worth the mention. The GRE curriculum and question quality is higher when compared to SAT, making scoring s perfect score relatively hard.Hope this was useful!Just a FYI, I do work for an Ed-Tech firm based out of New Delhi, India which is aimed at building awesome careers abroad! Check us out at http://www.leverageedu.comIf you want to take this discussion further forward or you want any help regarding your career, feel free to reach me out at samrat@leverageedu.com","Two answers.1. GRE is a bit harder than the SAT. But this is likely a small factor (if at all).2. Most importantly, a LOT fewer people take the GRE.  Consider that most college bound high school seniors take the SAT. That's millions of students every year.  Not all of these students will graduate with an undergraduate degree.  Now consider that only a tiny fraction of those graduates are interested in post-graduate education. Now consider that there are different exams for different areas, GMAT, GRE, etc. So now the number of students will be a tiny fraction of those who took the SAT.The rest is simple math. If the same ratio of people get perfect scores on the GRE as do on the SAT, that means for every perfect SAT score you hear about, you might have a 1% or less chance of hearing about a perfect GRE score.","In addition to earlier comments about the relatively low number of GRE test-takers, I would like to add that it is pretty awkward to publicize your GRE scores. I received a perfect score on both the math and verbal portions of the GRE. Coming out of a physics department at an Ivy League school, there was a basic understanding that you should probably get an 800 on the math section. If you didn't, that would be embarrassing; if you did, great, join the club. As for verbal, it was clear that no one cared. When I mentioned my verbal score at one point to my graduate school advisor, it became apparent he hadn't even looked at my scores. When a friend in my cohort asked and learned about my verbal score and then told someone else, I was actually rather mortified. I didn't want to seem like that awkward 17-year-old whose identity is wrapped up in doing well on the SAT. At some point during college (if not before), you realize that intelligence and potential are not really reflected in the ability to memorize and regurgitate information for a standardized test. Everyone else seems to realize that too -- which is why the GRE is occasionally used to weed folks out but does not usually carry much weight in graduate school admissions.  Sharing my test scores not only made me feel like a braggart, but even worse like a braggart boasting of something rather trivial.

I have a lot of respect for the people who do not prefer any assistance while preparation.However I felt that I needed some assistance as I was out of touch with academics for 2 years almost.

I would try to be as much unbiased as possible and go on with my experience as I never enrolled for magoosh as most of their material were already availavle in form of free apps or free videos.Now what I liked about EDGE was that they had variety of difficulty levels. So I was bound to practice more and more. A personal facilitator is assigned to every enrolled student who would provide constant feedback to the student. In my case I took the initiative to go after my facilitators, I used to e-mail them on a regular basis and they would get back to me on mail with resoonse to each and every query.I felt the 2 major regions where I feel I was got the benifit out of the program were:-Time Management: EDGE questions(advanced practice+mock) are having higher difficulty levels.

You can even revise words by filtering out the list u are focusing on .In conclusion i would say that, it really depends on your preparation level and what score you are aiming for.

GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It's ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!You could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your termsKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms","It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.You’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.You’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.You have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it. You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door. But, remember ‘freelancing job is also an actual job’. There’s nothing fancy about it until you make it.Before you are a freelancer you should prepare for being one. These is a simple road-map which you need to follow with determination, to make through this challenge.ACQUIRING SKILLS:This is the most important part. You need to acquire skills in whatever field you choose. You may find this boring and have an urge to jump over and look up to the offers. You may have misconceptions of having all necessary skills. But, this is the only way you can be successful in long run.Take a break to start an elaborated research in the chosen field and the specializations they demand.Look out for dummy projects to build a great portfolio. Offer to work with your peers, friends and nonprofit organizations for free.Keep a close look at people already in the industry and look up to their work. Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.MANAGING NETWORKSLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.Now that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.BEING THE BRANDThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.You need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help. Get your business cards and be ready to talk about the work you do and yourself more often.Learn some basic marketing and accounting skills. Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.THE ADVENTURE RIDENow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!Start looking out for jobs. This might be a slow-moving process, instead of getting stressed introspect your offers.At first work on project/job expecting limited or no money at all. This is to just make connection sharpening your skills and showcasing your talent. These resources might be helpful to start off: Upwork, Guru, Elance, PeoplePerHour, Freelancer, Craig list;Once you have built a quality portfolio and demonstrated your work it’s time to hunt big offers. Serve the clients with generosity, build a rapport. Businesses will start taking you seriously about your specialization.Your career will see a boost. In the long run, you can either be choosy about your project or take projects in volumes, both are keys to success. With time, you’ll be able to create a Brand which clients and businesses will look up to.Finally, keep up the good work and regularly meet other freelancers, talk them about your business. Use calling more often than emailing to a client. These things will give your brand a personal touch and also avoid the feeling of isolation. Now, you are independent and can set your own working ethics being selective about projects and jobs. The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.This answer is a part of my blog, read it here.If you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.Please do let me know your suggestions and feedback.I’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.","For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.That doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.But I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.For example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”To that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.Of course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.Here are a few:You learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.There are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.It’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.You get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?Freelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.Bottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.And you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.If you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.On the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.Once you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.","Let’s start step by step:1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.If you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:Freelancer - Hire & Find JobsUpworkCraigslistPeoplePerHour99designsGuruEngineerBabuHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.2. Build a Perfect websiteAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.While building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.Show diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.Include your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.If you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.3. Brand YourselfOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-Whether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.Along with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.Your logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.Most importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.The domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.Become a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.4. Understand the project requirement carefullyAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.The only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.9. Be ProfessionalWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-Starting date of projectThe project’s deadlineMilestonesFunctionalitiesSchedule meeting in priorMake the clear timeline of deliverables.Professionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–Keep Your Personal Life limited to yourselfYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.  It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.Charge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.Schedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.If some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.Build the right association.It is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.Follow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.Don’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.Be positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.10. Networking and Relationship with ClientsBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..Some useful techniques to grow your network.1. Increase your Social Media Network  Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.  2. Attend events You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.3. Speak at events Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event. 4. Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at. 5. Connect at co-working space You can share your desk with other freelancers from another field; this is the best way to enrich knowledge and network.  All points listed above reinforces you to become a freelancer, your perfect profile generation for freelance success and helps you in becoming your own boss with a promising career ahead."
GRE,How do I score 340 on the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-score-340-on-the-GRE,"Looking (TV series), GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exams and Tests",6,"This isn’t directly responsive to your question, but I wonder why you would want to waste precious days and weeks pursuing this goal. OK, if you enjoy mental challenges like this, perhaps it would be fun for you to try to get a 340 — and then you can go take the Mensa test and get another number to brag about.But if you think that getting a 340 on the GRE — instead of, say, a 320 — is going to get you into a good grad school, I think you may be disappointed, even if you do manage to get that 340.I can’t speak for every graduate program, of course, but over the years I have evaluated and rated hundreds of applications for PhD programs in Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science — among the top-rated CS programs in the world by almost any measure.And despite all this experience, I just had to go look up what a 340 score on the GREs means. I always look at the GRE percentile scores and not the arbitrary numerical scores, and so do most of my colleagues. If you’re from a good school that we know about, we look mostly at your grades (and at what courses you did well in), and not at the GREs.Also, we admit a lot of students from China and India who have good quantitative scores, but pretty weak verbal and writing scores. I always figure that, even if the person can communicate pretty well in English, taking the GRE in English is going to be unfairly hard for them, so I look mostly at the TOEFL scores to see if they can function in English.About the only time I pay serious attention to the GRE scores is if I can’t make sense of the undergrad university’s grading system, or if the GRE is so much lower than the applicant’s grades that it makes me suspicious.That’s just one data point, but if you’re tempted to spend time trying to optimize the last few points on your GRE score, I would strongly suggest spending that time on a research project instead, or reading a few more papers in the field you want to go into.","My answer is based on what I've gleaned from own experiences and from conversations with others who have scored 338 or above.Preparing for the examFirst, you should start out as a decent test-taker. Pre-preparation, you'll want to start out scoring at least 325-330 (if not higher) on your first couple of practice exams before deciding to aim for a 340.* Additionally, it helps to have taken and done well on other exams written by ETS, such as the SAT, if only to have familiarized yourself with the general style of ETS's question writing.Second, practice. Once you start consistently scoring at least 165-167 on each section, you have all the fundamentals down. You might want to brush up on a little bit of math or some vocabulary words that you're missing here and there, but otherwise it's practice all the way. Once you get up into the 336+ range, especially, the only thing that separates a 339-340 and a lower score is a couple mistakes. Consistency and practice are the difference-makers here.For this reason, I would strongly recommend doing computerized practice questions only (and there are services that offer more practice questions in the official computerized format than you could possibly need). You want to have the comfort of ""home-court advantage"" when taking a test—if the home team gets an additional 3-4 points per game per college basketball game, then being intimately familiar with the computerized test format might be the difference maker between a 339 and a 340. By the end, I was really fast at clicking the bubbles, marking questions, and navigating through the test in general. It might seem trivial, but the advantage of ""getting in the zone"" (not to mention saving a few seconds per section) is priceless.Test-day war planMake multiple full passes through each section. Strategy-wise, I took at least two passes through each quantitative reasoning section, doing the problems from scratch each time. With enough speed gained through practice, I was able to make a comfortable pass through each section in less than half the time allotted. It's definitely probable that most test-takers could get a 170 from doing just one careful pass (and maybe one check pass), but I felt that I maximized my chances (if only by a tiny bit) by doing the problems really quickly more than once.On the first and second passes, I would mark a question (and come back on a second or third pass) if I was slightest bit unconfident about my answer. On the second pass, especially, try your best to ignore what you did on your first pass; furthermore, I would recommend starting from the end of the section (the harder questions) first. This is extremely crucial for catching the small mistakes or consistent mis-readings of questions that often create one or two mistakes on the quantitative reasoning section. I would save a third pass just as a general sanity check or for one or two questions that I marked from the first two passes. If I felt that time was running down, I'd start checking the marked questions halfway through the second pass.Similarly, I would take at least two passes through each verbal reasoning section but wouldn't necessarily re-read the passages. Here, the emphasis was more on a couple of trickier questions (which I would mark during the first pass). It was harder for me to get a 170 on the verbal reasoning section but for a different reason: it was less about random mistakes and more about honing in on a few tricky questions. (A general strategy that applies to any test-taker is to shield out the answer choices when answering the passage-based questions, as the wrong answer choices only serve to distract—provide your own general response first before looking at and choosing among the answer choices.)Take frequent breaks. Even if I felt really good about a section I had just taken, I would always opt to take at least a short breather after that section.Pro tip: There's a long break in the middle of the test, but realistically you probably have enough time to drink water or use the restroom after any individual section. The ETS gives you a lot of time to read the general instructions at the beginning of each section (if I recall correctly, several minutes), and you can even click the button to request extra time to read the instructions, which you can do once per section. Honestly, unless you're fretting to begin the next section, I don't see any disadvantage to taking advantage of that time to ""reset"" and clear your mind before each section, especially if the previous section was a bit more hectic than you would have liked.Note that while some of the strategies I mention above are applicable to all test-takers, some are good only if you're looking to get a near-perfect scaled score (and otherwise could potentially be rather poor strategies if extreme accuracy is not your limiting factor, as you might be missing questions due to the rapid pace of making multiple passes).*I'm not saying it's not possible to get a 340 starting out with a lower score, depending on exactly how and why you got the lower score, but if you're starting far below a 330, shooting for a 340 starts to become less realistic and a matter of diminishing marginal returns on your time: the GRE is less important to grad admissions than the MCAT and SAT are to medical school and college admissions, respectively. Realistically, anything above a 330 is quite sufficient for admission to most top grad schools in the U.S. if your other credentials are good, especially if you're applying as a domestic student (though do note that many top math/engineering/physics programs desire a near-170 quantitative reasoning score as a sanity check). Even if you're looking to get a score in the 336-340 range, note that the grind to get from, say, a 330 to a 335 is arguably faster and less treacherous than that to get from a 336 to a 340.If you're dead-set on a 340, though, I'd start with the steps highlighted in the many excellent answers to How do I prepare for the GRE to score above 330?There are certainly accounts of people out there who have put hundreds of hours over many months preparing for the GRE, which is certainly warranted in some cases depending on their goals, but putting in the extra month of study to improve just to a couple points is not really worth it. Do more research. Get more job experience. Learn more about the world. Eat some pie.","GRE consists of the following sections:Analytical Writing – 2 sections or tasks“Analyze	an issue”“Analyze	an argument”Verbal Reasoning – 2 sections25 questions/sectionQuantitative Reasoning – 2 sections25 questions/sectionIt is not much difficult to score in quant. Manhattan and Kalpan are the best sourcesYour verbal ability accounts for two thirds of your score; quantitativeability accounts for the rest. To do well in GRE, you must ace thelinguistic side of the test.How do you do that?Cultivatea habit of reading extensively. Any book (my personal recommendation are the classics), magazines – TheEconomist, Reader’s Digest.newspapers – NewYork Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian(the best content lies in the editorials, and definitely not in the Page-3/entertainment section), websites and news sites (BBC has some of the finest content).Moving on to the Verbal Reasoning section. The finest tool you can equipyourself with, to crack this section is a vast vocabulary. Now, some of us are somehow blessed with a vast vocabulary, most of us,unfortunately, aren’t. That makes learning vocabulary our primary challenge in cracking GRE.How do I build my vocabulary?Extensive reading helps; but this is tedious method of getting there. There is extensive literature available on GRE specific vocabulary; various sources are give you this list. Kaplan’s and Barron’s have their long and condensed lists for you.Thebest of them all, however, is VocabSmith. (I must confess here that Irepresent VocabSmith). VocabSmith teaches you the words with meaning,usages and synonyms. VocabSmith uses the state-of-art RST algorithm,which is the most advanced learning methodology for vocabulary.Psychological research suggests that new words are learned best by repeated exposure to them, up to 4-7 times.VocabSmith’s RST algorithm governs your exposure to the words, in a frequency determined to be the most optimized, as suggested by proven psychological research. The algorithm further aligns this revision on the user’s difficulty in learning the words – you find a word difficult, no problem, VocabSmith revises it more for you. This way,VocabSmith ensures that your time spent on the tool maximizes your retention of the words, and associate with word usages.VocabSmith’s content has been prepared by veterans who’ve been in this industry for over 15 years. The list of words in each of its courses have been carefully chosen, so as to optimize your preparation for GRE. You could choose from the following three packages:GRE Complete – For the marathoners. This course contains the complete	GRE word list of 3500+ words.GRE High Frequency – For the medium-distance runners. This course contains a thoroughly-researched list of 1000+ words repeated often	in GREGRE Ultra High Frequency – For the sprinters. This course contains	400+ words that have appeared the most often in GRE.Itis available in both Android and iOS versions. Links are given below:iOS:	https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/...Android:	https://play.google.com/store/ap...","Lawrence Chiou’s answer is excellent, so I won’t repeat what he has said. Read his first, and I’ll add on more.Verbal:You are probably not going to score 340 without a large vocabulary. If you have a long time to prep, start reading lots of non-fiction and intellectual new sources like the Economist. If you have a weak vocabulary and short time to prepare, memorize an available list, but set your sights a bit lower.Process of Elimination is super important. Particularly when you need to pick two words that both fit the sentence *and* match. On the tricky questions, they like to throw in words that fit the sentence but do not have a pair. Eliminate them.Tone is very important. Look for positive and negative words and make sure your answer matches.Quantitative:You should have enough time to go through each question twice. Try to solve the problem in two different ways to make sure your answers are consistent and you didn’t miss a trap.It’s very important to back-solve. Almost all questions you can plug the answer in to solve for the initial conditions. This can be one of your two way.Use shortcuts to narrow down choices. eg. in a triangle the third side will always be less than the sum of the other two. Or the angles will sum to 180. On some questions, only one answer will meet these basic criteria and you won’t need to solve the problem completely.Test Day:Drink plenty of water.In your practice tests, you should be finishing the sections in less than 15 minutes. Use this time to get up, perhaps take a water/bathroom break and then review the questions in a fresh mindset (note: if you have trouble completing the sections in < 20 minutes, a 340 is probably unrealistic).Try and book your exam on a date/time when you will be in a good mental space (eg. not right before a holiday, morning/afternoon, Monday vs. Friday. When are you sharpest?)Dress comfortably but professionally. I found that wearing business casual put me in the right mind set. A psychological hack to put yourself in a focused, business-oriented mindset.Use the ‘mark’ function to mark questions you should triple-check.Don’t bother memorizing school codes. You can look up the school at the end of the test and if you really can’t find it, you can pay to send it afterward.If you are applying to business school, write the GMAT first. I found the Reading Comprehension, Critical Reasoning and Quantitative Problem Solving to be tougher on the GMAT. If you prepared for the GMAT, you will have to do little prep in these areas for the GRE."
GRE,What are the easiest ways to learn math and vocabulary for the GRE to score above 320?,https://www.quora.com//What-are-the-easiest-ways-to-learn-math-and-vocabulary-for-the-GRE-to-score-above-320,"GREedge, GRE Preparation, Vocabulary Development, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Exam and Test Advice, Exam and Test Preparation, How-to Question, Exams and Tests",29,"To thoseWho don’t have much time to prepare, such as those having a job (my case) or too much of college work.Preparing on their own, without any coaching. Without any hard books.Who are lazy. (Less euphemistically)Here’s my brief:(It’s quite a long read - TL; DR at the end)I was not able to do what they do, owing to the lack of time. These things should not let you down--“No time for Mock tests”: I did not take any (of the 3) mock tests fully - I only used to attempt both the Quant sections, review the mistakes, and ultimately end up preparing for Quant only till the day ended. I’d attempted Verbal only once (that too while triple-clicking and peeping at the meaning for each of the words that were unknown to me :P ) and gotten only 20 of 40 correct. This was before I’d started preparations, so I didn’t mind it much.LAST MINUTE Preparations: In spite of everyone telling me against it, I couldn’t leave the house in the morning without scrolling through my (mostly unprepared) word list, and the salient Quant mistakes notes.“Enough Sleep before the Day”: Didn’t have! :( Feeling underprepared, just twisting on the bed for hours without sleep!What I can make out nowAll that last minute anxiety, laziness towards Verbal, the last sleepless night, were all immaterial. For the most important thing is to be Calm & Concentrated during the exam. That’s all! :) Your score is already decided; a few months’ preparation would be puny in front of the all the Math/English that you’ve acquired during the past 20-25 years of your life.The post by Ananth Balasubramanian is the truest. Sincere thanks to him. :)[Here’s the link: GRE brief by Ananth Balasubramanian | Facebook]Suggested preparation material (i.e. the ones that I referred to)Manhattan 5 lb. (the hot favourite) for Quant - being a lover of Maths, I solved all of the problems and tests in this.ETS Official Guide - devour it completely! Burp!ETS Quant Practice and ETS Verbal Practice books - the best ones to understand the type & range of questions asked and to develop your own strategies.Magoosh Vocabulary Builder app - for the times when I used to take a break or while commuting or that eyes-wide-open-in-the-phone-light time before sleep.Quant tipsPractice all types of questions from all topics. Don’t even ignore simple Algebra questions like “1+3=?”, for there must be a trick involved. Even once would do, if you grasp things quickly.Then review the answers and keep jotting down the mistakes you commit. These should be helpful at the LAST MINUTE preparations. (For example, don’t ignore fractions and negative values in x2; double check DI questions; that new formula of ‘sample standard deviation’ etc.) If you have time, do review the answers to the correct ones too - there can be some wisdom provided there too, e.g. in Manhattan and ETS books.Verbal tipsPractise RC as much as you can. It’s not important that you finish the whole book of RC99. I did practise only about 15-20 essays from the books that I’ve mentioned. The important thing is to learn how to critically think about the questions and the choices. Every now and then, you’d have to reason with the choices like: “Hey! The passage does say that Apples are Bad. But it doesn’t state ‘specifically’ that they’re bad in taste. So eliminate.” Reasoning gets even more stringent than this. Learn to do it, and RC is your toy.Also, speed reading in RC helps a lot. Verbal sections might be found to be time-taking by you.SE and TC - Go with your instinct. Eliminate. Practice didn’t help me much I guess. But to be confident in the exam, do practise. :)AWA tipsI don’t think I’m the right person to speak about it. I only read a few samples from the ETS OG, on the day before D-day. I like writing, and so I could write quite much in the exam as well.All this I did within 10 days effectively. Lack of sleep didn’t bother me on the test day. (Might bother others, do sleep!)However, during preparations, I believe sleep matters - for whatever you learn needs the warmth of the pillow to be happy to stay in your brain... :)As much important are everyday chores and play - I used to play at least two games of Carrom everyday during my preparation. But DON’T do anything that brings that guilt in you of having wasted time.On Test DayHad slept only for 4 hours the night before, awoke at 6:30 AM, had only one banana for breakfast, and reached the venue at 7:30 AM. To my surprise, security check had already begun! :O Plus, to add to the torment, the ‘Prometric Intro video’ was playing on the TV there in loop! Grrr!AWA topics were good, had ample thoughts to write. Time is also enough for you to write 400-500 words.Happy to see the Quant section first! :D Got all the answers. However, it was trickier and lengthier than the second Quant section - so I knew that it was experimental.And most of the verbal passages I got were related to Science - Astronomy, Chemistry, Botany etc. Lucky, for I love to read about those. :)A Little Time Hack: Don’t press the Continue button when the section finishes. Take deep breaths. Prepare your mind to shift from Q to V or V to Q. Then press Continue and enjoy an official break of 60 more seconds ... :P (Had read this somewhere, so implemented.)Break time: Snickers. No wonder. (I think ETS should write this in the GRE conventions’ PDF now)All went smooth. And the score screen. My eyes went to the Quantitative section first: 170. Emotionless. Fine. Expected. Then they turned to Verbal section: 159. I added it to my Quant score and... “WTF! It’s becoming 329! Perhaps my brain is too tired to do simple addition now”, I’d said to myself. I did the Math again. And then again on the yellow rough sheet - that’s when it settled in!I smiled, filled in the Universities, and went straight to my friends waiting for a party. :)TL; DRKNOW the question types; PRACTISE until you start getting the answers correct; CHILL often: most importantly, during the exam.All the Best! :)[If anyone has any further queries, I'd be happy to help. :) ]——————————————————————————————————————————Update | May 22, 2016Admitted in Texas A&M University, College Station, to the M.Eng. in Construction Engineering & Management program!Happy as Hell!! :D——————————————————————————————————————————Update | June 30, 2017Working for one of the largest construction companies in the US!Happier!! :D :D","Dear GRE Aspirant!Two key phrases caught my attention in your question: “easiest ways” and “above 320”. Let me begin with the 2nd phrase since it is the more important among the two.An above 320 score is the popular benchmark for the success of your application – although there are many more factors to it. Going by the consensus, here is how a Good and a Great GRE score may look like.Good ScoreGreat ScoreAdditionally, why don’t we draw some inference from the statistics for admission to some top-notch colleges in the U.S.:The statistics shown above will convince you of the importance of securing section-wise efficient scores in the GRE. A 165 in Quant, coupled with a 155 in Verbal makes 320, but need not serve the best outcome with respect to your target university. Coming to the other phrase (i.e., easiest ways), you must understand that easy comes from comfort – and that comfort comes from two things: Ability & Alacrity. The better you are at something, the easier it feels. Again, the more prepared you are for something – the easier it becomes. All this philosophy is to help you understand the importance of Planning & Preparation. These two Ps make GRE easier to tame. We will come to this soon!Tame your VerbalLet’s begin with a few things to focus on for your Verbal section:Without discounting the importance of the 3500 high frequency words for GRE, you must also refer Barron’s 333. These are apparently the more frequent ones to occur.The Verbal section of the GRE is not about memory, word power or vocabulary. It is more about analogy, context, and comprehension. Hence, invest in learning the context for each word.Select a handful of words every week – and read at least 5 blogs/articles in context to each such word. This reinforces enough context around the word – making it almost unforgettable.The old strategies of relying on mnemonics, visual/audio, root words, theme based words, synonyms for context, etc. are still extremely effective and relevant. Utilize technology where you can, and rely on building your Verbal foundations using visual & associative methods of learning. Apps like WordBot, Flashcards, are extremely effective in this regard.Develop the habit of speed reading. Only 20% of a sentence is enough for context. This will help you achieve great speed and accuracy (since you wouldn’t be affected by random words in the sentence).Conquer QuantNow, a few hacks for the Quant section:Master Mental Math. A large subset of questions you encounter would be intense with lots of smaller problems leading to the final solution. Mastering Mental Math techniques like Vedic Math etc. will take away the weeds from the path.Practice and practice hard, with an intent to solve any question you encounter within 90 seconds. Some solutions could be shorter, say 25 seconds.Value your time, but do not rush. Read between the options available and often you will see through the traps GRE sets for all.Learn the art of IGMO, i.e., Intelligent Guessing and Moving On. GRE does not penalize a wrong answer. If the questions seem a bit wavering for you, resort to IGMO.Pick concepts and solve questions based on them. This will enable you to approach each question with an intent to build its back/spine. Once you strengthen the spine, you can take it all!Always try to build a Flow or Diagram for questions. Each question just lays out the facts in front of you. What can be confused by words, can be disseminated by figures!Learn to use the Online Calculator. It is an extremely underrated gift/lenience GRE offers. Most people end up solving square roots on paper. Act smarter and use a calculator. All of this is best done when you have a Plan and Preparation in place.How does Planning help?Peter Drucker said: “You can't manage what you can't measure”. A plan will help you stay focused and on the sprint. No plan is fool-proof, but a study plan will ensure you are aware of your progress. It will help you mobilize more resources when needed, and prioritize better.Take a look at the below figure to understand the same.Note that the above data corresponds to aspirants who had invested and dedicated themselves to a Tight Study plan and a Learning Tracker, in their quest for a 320+ score in GRE.Sample Study Plan Structure based on time period:1 month study plan structureAllocate at least 4 hours a day to prepare for GRE, diligently – without fail.Focus on the toughest problems and concepts.Compare your progress with peers and steer your preparation plan daily based on the same.Take as many timed and test-environment simulated tests as may be possible.Be clear of where you need help and reach to the Personal Coach without any remorse.3 months study plan structureEnforce Time Management strategies like 2 minute rules for every question.Work up stamina for 4 hour tests, by taking regular proctored and simulated tests.Focus a lot on deciphering and finding the way through long RCs and passages.Identify weak areas/concepts, and scheduling help sessions for the same.Build a diligent Word consumption strategy (e.g. WordBot, Flashcards, etc.).Stay well-versed with as many axioms and formulae pertaining to Geometry as possible.6 months study plan structureA more relaxed approach to building core concepts.Heavy focus on building reading habit.Periodicals and editorial sections of top/acclaimed journals are a must. Additionally, classic novels and books are welcome.A daily focus on assimilating 10-20 new words from the high frequency list of words.Weekly proctored tests to analyze weak areas.Building good arithmetic and quick math skills.Strong focus on practising Data Interpretation and Sentence Equivalence questions, given the time in hand to master the same.It is consistently quipped that 90 days should be a good period to enable your GRE prep. Having said that, you could just get double sure with a 180 day study plan!Nothing gets easier than following a time tested study plan, especially when someone else out there dedicates all their hours to build your excellence.Do not let too much information confuse your choices. Think logically, and you will see that sense prevails by following a stringent study plan.All the best!","I scored a 320+ with Q:170.GRE is a tricky exam which just can't be randomly answered. I started two months prior to the exam. The first thing I did was to research about the books that you will be reading from and here is my view about books:ETS GRE Official Book- This book is a must, it gives insights to what actual GRE will be and is the closest to GRE level. It contains all information about the exam, practice sets in verbal and Quants and AWA and two written tests. Apart from written tests, you get a CD which contains powerpep softwareManhattan 5LB- This is a comprehensive book, has exhaustive practice sets for RCs, SE and TC and gives you tips to study. I found Quants from Manhattan easy most of the time . It is a recommended book for verbalPrinceton Review- This book is for beginners, I would recommend this book only to those who haven't had a chance to verse well with English ,the level is easier than GRE for both Quants and verbal. Don't buy this book if you are well versed with Quants and Verbal.As far as my schedule goes, I had to manage it along with my undergrad( Engineering). I would give 4–5 days a week for verbal ,esp RCs. It's always better to work in group for verbal, discuss with your friends, or your GRE teacher if you have joined tutorials. Focus on vocab, but not too much ,GRE is no longer vocab centric , Manhattan 1000 words, Princeton 1409 and magoosh flash cards are enough for this. Start with your vocab early,read and understand words while you are free, or in your commute. TC and SE are scoring questions ,I focussed more on them rather than RCs.Coming to Quants, I just used Manhattan 5LB. Since I appeared for JEE Mains engineering entrance exam, which has much higher level mathematics, I didn't find the need to study for GRE, as Quants is more about your basic maths and alertness to tricky questions.Lastly, I gave a lot of mock exams, 6 Manhattan tests from their portal which costs around $40. 2 Princeton tests and 2 ETS Powerprep. I found Manhattan tests extremely helpful esp in Quants, on other hand I found Princeton verbal easy and Quants nearly same as GRE . Powerprep has two tests and both are of utmost importance, test 1 seems easier than test 2. Your final exams marks can be nearly +/-3 of Powerprep 2 obv not without exceptionsDon't over study, be calm and chilled for GRE, study regularly, converse with your friends in English or maybe play a vocab game. I used to play vocab game in magoosh with my friends by challenging them.All the best for your GRE!Protip: Anytime during exam if you feel that the level of questions has fallen down, realize that you performed bad in the previous section as GRE is adaptive. Rejoice if the level is same or harder :p","The graduate record exam or the GRE is calculated out of 340(170 in quants and 170 in verbal)Now to get over the score bandwidth of 320 ,one must score atleast a 160 in each of the two sections.NOTE: If one is an engineering student,one can easily go above 160 in quants ,however if one has not touched mathematics beyong grade 12 then one needs to follow an arduous schedule of bringing all the mathematical concepts back in track.1) GO BACK TO THE BASICS: For quants basics, MANHATTAN REVIEW 5LB is the best.It will not only make the weak areas strong,but will aquaint you with any all the types that you could be presented with in the actual GRE.For verbal, more than knowledge of vocabulary ,a test of analytical evaluation based on which word will suit in the blank is followed. Henceforth it is strongly suggested to go through the MAGOOSH APP .Moreover the usage of the words in the apt places can be best learnt by reading from the ATLANTIC,NEW YORKER.2)PRACTICE: Once you are done recapitulating with these,one should practice in real test time conditions.For this one can purchase Manhattan 6 practice tests .The average of these tests is a giveaway of your score in the actual gre(+ or- 2)ETS gives access to 2 tests .Even the scores obtained here is a rough estimate of the actual score one would get on their test day.3) MAINTAIN YOUR CALM AND STRATEGISE: On the test day it is very important to have a healthy breakfast , read any article (to ensure that the RC you get is not the 1st article you are reading).If one is not performing well in the first sections,motivation and pep talk oneself that the best is yet to come and this could have been the experimental section.Moreover if one is weak in certain areas,it is better to leave them to the last as a bird in hand is worth two in the bush.Ensure you answer all questions as there is no negative marking in the GRE."
GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It's ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!You could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your termsKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms","It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.You’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.You’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.You have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it. You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door. But, remember ‘freelancing job is also an actual job’. There’s nothing fancy about it until you make it.Before you are a freelancer you should prepare for being one. These is a simple road-map which you need to follow with determination, to make through this challenge.ACQUIRING SKILLS:This is the most important part. You need to acquire skills in whatever field you choose. You may find this boring and have an urge to jump over and look up to the offers. You may have misconceptions of having all necessary skills.

Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.MANAGING NETWORKSLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.Now that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.BEING THE BRANDThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.You need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help. Get your business cards and be ready to talk about the work you do and yourself more often.Learn some basic marketing and accounting skills. Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.THE ADVENTURE RIDENow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!Start looking out for jobs. This might be a slow-moving process, instead of getting stressed introspect your offers.At first work on project/job expecting limited or no money at all. This is to just make connection sharpening your skills and showcasing your talent. These resources might be helpful to start off: Upwork, Guru, Elance, PeoplePerHour, Freelancer, Craig list;Once you have built a quality portfolio and demonstrated your work it’s time to hunt big offers.

With time, you’ll be able to create a Brand which clients and businesses will look up to.Finally, keep up the good work and regularly meet other freelancers, talk them about your business. Use calling more often than emailing to a client. These things will give your brand a personal touch and also avoid the feeling of isolation.

The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.This answer is a part of my blog, read it here.If you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.Please do let me know your suggestions and feedback.I’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.","For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.That doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.But I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.For example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”To that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.Of course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.Here are a few:You learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.There are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.It’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.You get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?Freelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.Bottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.And you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.If you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.On the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.Once you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.","Let’s start step by step:1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.If you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:Freelancer - Hire & Find JobsUpworkCraigslistPeoplePerHour99designsGuruEngineerBabuHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.2. Build a Perfect websiteAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.While building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.Show diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.Include your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.If you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.3. Brand YourselfOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-Whether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.Along with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.Your logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.Most importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.The domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.Become a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.4. Understand the project requirement carefullyAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.The only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.9. Be ProfessionalWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-Starting date of projectThe project’s deadlineMilestonesFunctionalitiesSchedule meeting in priorMake the clear timeline of deliverables.Professionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–Keep Your Personal Life limited to yourselfYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.  It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.Charge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.Schedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.If some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.Build the right association.It is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.Follow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.Don’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.Be positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.10. Networking and Relationship with ClientsBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..Some useful techniques to grow your network.1. Increase your Social Media Network  Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.  2. Attend events You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.3. Speak at events Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event. 4. Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at. 5.

GRE,I made a monumental mistake in my SOP for graduate school by writing the same university's name in the middle of the SOP. Do I have no chance?,https://www.quora.com//I-made-a-monumental-mistake-in-my-SOP-for-graduate-school-by-writing-the-same-universitys-name-in-the-middle-of-the-SOP-Do-I-have-no-chance,"Master of Science Degree Admissions and the Graduate Record Examination, Graduate Record Examination Advice, Master of Science Degree Admissions, The GRE and Postgraduate University Admissions, Graduate School Admissions Advice, Master's of Science Degree Advice, College and University Admissions Advice, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, College and University Admissions",11,"I can offer an anecdote of advice. I was told that for my SOP I should include a customized paragraph about each school. This included a short list of multiple professors at that school that I wanted to work with, including names of those who I had already been in contact with prior to submitting my application, and reasons why I thought we would be a good fit. I do think this helped my application because it showed that I was prepared to work with multiple professors (you never know who you might not be compatible with) and it shows that I had been thinking about grad school for a while. Now, you've already submitted your application so if you didn't do this, I wouldn't worry. Plenty of people don't and make it into grad school with just strong letters and a decent CV. For myself, I needed a little more.  This can just serve as advice to other readers who might be looking for application advice. So in my application to University of California San Diego I found out after I submitted that I had put in my final sentence, ""and that's why Univeristy of Washington will be a good fit for me."" Or something to that effect. Oops. Well, to make it short I got accepted to UC San Diego. It seemed they didn't care so much. Now, as I mentioned, I had written about professors from UC San Diego, so that may have helped, but I still wrote Washington at the end.  It's likely professors reviewing your application understand what being busy is like, and they know you might want to go to their school, even if it's maybe not your first choice. They can still tell if you're a good candidate and will overlook the tiny error for a record of good research, a genuine interest in your field, and some good letters of recommendation. Good luck!","Hi,I don't mean to dishearten you - but this is a common admissions committee gripe - the fact that applicants use a one-size-fit-all SOP and sometimes don't even realize they haven't changed the school name.Given that U Penn's November 15th deadline, CMU's December 3 deadline, UCSD's December 15 deadline and UIUC's December 15 deadline have gone by a while back, communicating with the school for changing your SOP might not yield results. All the same, I would suggest you connect with admissions and ask if you will be allowed to replace your SOP because of a typo. Given that JHU has an application submission deadline of Feb 15 - I am most optimistic about this working at JHU.Good Luck!","I've done graduate admissions in CS for several years. Please don't worry about it. If your reader is going to reject you for just this reason, you don't want to go there anyway. I think most readers will realize you have applied to multiple schools. Mistakes happen all the time - this is a minor one. ","There's a reason that, in my recommendation letter advice article, I tell people to not customize their letters unless they really have something specific to say. The same applies to statements. At best, simply mentioning the name of the university tells me you know how to use a merge program. At worst, it tells me you don't even know how to use one.Fortunately, certain kinds of merging are not considered vital skills for computer science graduate students. And guess what: every year we see a dozen different statements or recommendation letters that make exactly this mistake.It will make the admissions committee members chuckle and shake their heads, and probably wonder a bit about your attention to detail. But it's not lethal; it's not in itself a cause for rejection."
GRE,"With a GRE score of 306, can I get admission to the University of California at Santa Barbara for an MS in CS?",https://www.quora.com//With-a-GRE-score-of-306-can-I-get-admission-to-the-University-of-California-at-Santa-Barbara-for-an-MS-in-CS,"University of California, Santa Barbara, Master's Programs and the Graduate Record Examination, Master's Programs Admissions, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Master's Programs",5,"Well, up until last year, I was chair of graduate admissions at UCSB. Now that I’ve (left for University of Chicago, and) handed off the reins to one of my great colleagues (their identity will remain a secret), I can answer this question. My answer is that your chances are not very good.UCSB MS is extremely competitive, basically similar to selectivity (or even more selective) than the UCSB CS PhD program. Given some reasonable background/scores/letters, you might have a better chance if you applied for the PhD.Why is this? UCSB CS has not focused on building a large MS program in the past. Thus the number of slots for MS students is fairly small each year. Plus, BS/MS students take slots from the same pool. So if there’s a year with a large batch of strong BS/MS students, then the number of remaining MS spots might be ridiculously low.Still. You should apply, and hope for the best. I wish you the best of luck!","I am currently a student here at UC Santa Barbara in the MS Computer Science program. Based on my experience, I would say the chances would be very slim unless your undergrad performance was very good (prob at least 3.85+) and you have good references/recommendation letters with a solid personal statement and honestly a strong will to pursue a graduate degree that is reflected in your Personal Statement. I would also add that if you have done research at a well known university during undergraduate that will definitely help. But just GRE score is not a good enough overall picture. However if none of the above is applicable, and your undergraduate was average, I would say the GRE score would be on the very low end since the MS program here is very selective and as someone else mentioned the BS/MS students do take up slots from the already small class size.","It depends.With only a GRE score of 306 with quant 160. You might not be given an admit. If you have a bachelors in CS with CGPA 9.0 and above & research papers along with great SOP and recommendations, you might have a chance.If you do not have bachelors in CS and want to do MS in CS with GRE score of 306, it’ll not work.Cheers,Vishu.","I had 1460 and I had trouble getting in to UCSB’s grad school. Ben Zhao, I used to teach their back in the late eighties. Were you there then? I taught the C programming classes for grad students."
GRE,How do I best prepare for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-best-prepare-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions",39,"Hi! I have taken the General GRE exam in March 2017 and scored 329/340 with 163 in Verbal and 166 in Quantitative. I will tell you my experience and in general some tips as to how to fare well on the exam. Nevertheless, preparation strategies vary from person to person.If you want to get an idea as to where you stand even before you start your preparation, I would suggest you to take a free mock test online. I would recommend the one offered by Galvanize. It's not a full test, but has one Verbal section and one Quantitative section. You just need to spend an hour and you would get an idea when you check your scores as to where you made mistakes and which concepts you need to learn better. This, in my opinion, embarks your preparation for GRE!The most important thing to do is to first book your test date. Until and unless your test date is booked, you would not get the requisite motivation to start your preparation. That was what I did. I first scheduled my test and then took the mock to see where I stood. I scored 302/340 in the mock test. I was not at all prepared. So the results were as expected. I found out the concepts I needed to study and started working on them.Talking about how much time you need to invest preparing for the test, it is totally dependent on what you do. If you are an engineering student or a mathematics student or someone taking math courses and constantly staying in touch with the subject, I assure you that Quantitative section would be a cakewalk! At the same time, I would like to emphasize that ETS has raised the bars for Quantitative section and it is not as trivial as it once seemed to be (I'm not generalizing anything here; whatever I say is what I opine). If you want to start from scratch and study everything throughly, I'd highly recommend enrolling for some online GRE coaching.You can subscribe for Magoosh as it would prep you up for the toughest questions - questions that are too tough that ETS might not consider asking them- which is a very good thing as you would find the actual test pretty easy! You can take a subscription for three months or six months depending on what is ideal for you and depending on when you have scheduled your test. Do not think of it as a waste of money because in the worst case scenario where you do bad in your first attempt, you might end up wasting more money for your second attempt! So it's okay to spend some money when necessary because it's worth it. :)Practice all the material religiously, and work everyday. Make sure you have the ETS official book with you and also download the Powerprep software from ETS website. Set a target, say, that you would complete your first round of preparation in a month and then take the first test on the Powerprep software. Depending on your score, you would know where you stand. You can then improve your score by focusing more on areas where you lost marks. Take the second test one week before your actual test date after you think you're fully prepared. That test is relatively tougher than the first one. Spend the last one week practicing rigorously.VerbalVocabulary plays a crucial role in Verbal section, but, remember that it is not everything. It contributes to about 20% of your score on verbal section. The most important aspect is practicing comprehensions and text completions. GRE is an exam which you can excel by practicing more and more problems! That's the key to scoring high on GRE. So don't spend too much time simply learning words. Instead, practice more questions and continue learning words. This approach is more helpful.QuantitativeThe key to scoring high on quantitative is practice and practice and practice! Also, remember that the exam would put you under a time pressure. So practice with time and try to do as many questions as you can with minimum number of mistakes. Every question is worth the same score. So focus more on getting questions right than on somehow answering all the questions.Analytical WritingIt would suffice to score above 3.5 in this section, but I would suggest you to spend some time and get a better score. It's not all about getting a reasonable score but it's about getting a decent and deserving score. If you're good at essay writing and arguments, you would hardly need to spend any time for this section. Otherwise, you need to practice writing and the more you practice, the better you get at it. ETS asks questions only from the given pool of essays. So make sure to check them out. I have practiced several topics from the pool of essays and scored 5/6 in this section.There are websites that have collections of GRE preparation books including Kaplan, Baron's, Manhattan, Princeton and old ETS books. So try to get them and practice as much as you can! :)Finally, I would say practice makes your GRE score perfect! I mean it literally, a perfect score of 340 is attainable with practice. :)All the best!PS: I have forgotten to mention this. In order to improve vocabulary on a long-term basis, do study Word Power Made Easy by Nornan Lewis. But this book doesn't cover several GRE words! So please download the app called “Painless GRE”. It has around 4000 words. Once you're done learning them, most of your vocabulary prep is done! :)","Be sure to register early for your GRE exam so that there is enough time to process any necessary paperwork, and so that you can take the exam at the center of your choice and at your desired time and date.

With a little planning and foresight, it will suddenly start looking orderly, logical and attainable. GRE preparation is a rigorous mental workout, which builds your accuracy, timing and confidence after consistent practice. One needs to train his/her mind to ingrain the concepts, techniques and strategies that are essential to crack GRE, and be able to invoke them during the exam. Also, preparation necessitates one to strike a right balance between study and breaks. Breaks serve as revitalizers to escape from unexciting routine of daily preparation, and if not taken in time, can lead to information overload and eventual burnout.Reaching a score plateau can be quiet a frustrating reality. The key is to keep pressing forward with increased positivity, better focus and fine-tuning your study plan to make the most of it. The idea is to reach the Peak after having worked on your accuracy, timing yourself appropriately and scoring high in practice tests. Once your score hits a point you have set your mind on, it is the most opportune moment to take GRE.You may want to take care of these little things to ensure success in the GRE:Your brain has a level of saturation beyond which its efficiency starts reducing. Take regular breaks and let your brain refresh and recharge itself. Once that happens, you will be able to bounce back and achieve much more.Set a right rhythm for GRE. Just cramming and practicing like a maniac will not work. You need to follow a steady strategy of learning-understanding-analysing-practicing-taking mock test followed by a well-deserved break.Monitor your progress in terms of your timing, accuracy and score continuously.Consistent practice is always better than last minute rigors. HOW TO CRACK GREMake a concrete, but realistic study plan and try to stick to it. It will put you in the right trajectory of discipline, where you will start to take your study as seriously as you take your dentist’s appointment after an excruciating toothache. HOW TO CRACK GREWhile you are self-motivated to study the subjects you are good at, you need to bury your head like the proverbial ostrich and practice the subjects you are not so fond of. Facing and overcoming your weak areas will make you better equipped and more confident.Over exertion and last minute cramming can prove detrimental to your scores. Make sure you are not stressed out, get enough sleep and eat healthy food before the exam day. HOW TO CRACK GREFollowing a routine over a period of time, taking practice tests at exactly the same time as your GRE slot does a lot of good to not only set your biological clock, but also gives you a subconscious training for taking the GRE.Divide your time assiduously. Do not keep reading one subject continuously. It is wise to alternate between two or different subjects to keep your interest level alive.GRE score is not a measurement of your intelligence, but is an indicator of how well planned, dedicated and positive you are as a person. Do not let GRE blues knock you down. Take it with a composed and forward looking approach.For more information on GRE/TOEFL/IELTS/GMAT, please visithttp://www.collegepond.com/resou...MS in US 2019 || Collegepond"
GRE,"Apart from good GRE scores, what are the other credentials required to ensure admission to a top foreign university for an MS program?",https://www.quora.com//Apart-from-good-GRE-scores-what-are-the-other-credentials-required-to-ensure-admission-to-a-top-foreign-university-for-an-MS-program,"The GRE and Postgraduate University Admissions, Master's Programs and the Graduate Record Examination, Master's Programs Admissions, Master of Science in Computer Science, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Master of Science Degrees, Master's Programs, College and University Admissions, College Advice",41,"Note: You can follow my Quora blog for more info about higher education abroad: https://studyabroadgre.quora.com/SOP Evaluation here: SOP Evaluation procedure by Mihir on Study AbroadPS: Before I answer anything else, I will directly answer the question asked by most of the applicants: Can my GRE compensate for poor GPA/CGPA? The answer is NO. Now read everything below:GRE is not a big selection criterion for MS programs. The selection of a candidate for MS program is a 2 stage process:Screening process by the admin department: This screening process goes something like, there is a list of cut-off score or threshold values for certain selection criterion. For example, all students with GRE above 310 will be cleared, or all students with CGPA above 8.0/10.0 will be selected etc. This limit is not very strict and is flexible. TOEFL is one such criterion that will fall only and only in this screening process and not evaluated for the next one, unless you are going for TA/RA, in which case they need to evaluate your English language capability (still it will be least importance).Selection process by Adcom: In this process, you will be judged on your GPA, GRE score, SOP, LOR etc and is highly flexible. A student with great acads but not so good GRE can be selected over a student with perfect GRE score and average acads. It depends on your whole application file BUT certain parameters weigh more than the others.Usually the selection criterion goes like this (in descending order):Academic GPA/CGPA/%age as well as ranking in your batchUndergrad universitySOPResearch ex/Work exGRELORThese other factors will vary from case to case:Final Year ProjectInternship and papersCo/Extra-curricularProf LettingProblems people might face:BacklogsYear GapPlagiarismSome people may disagree, but this is what I personally think, seen and experienced.SELECTION CRITERION:1. Acads are the most important parameters:Your GPA or %age is the prime deciding factor. If you are topper in your batch and have shown outstanding academic performance, the chances are that you will be a preferable candidate for the program. Backlogs will damage your admission chances drastically. Although you can still find cases with a lot of backlogs and people still get admission in the university. Read this link at the end of the answer those who have low confidence in this area (he had 55 backlogs; read the whole thread/story).2. Undergrad University:If you belong to one of the top universities in your country, and you have descent acads, then you have good chances of admission. BEWARE, if you are from a top university BUT your acads are weak you will have a disadvantage compared to a student who is from a descent ranking university but high GPA. That's how it goes, 'Be on the top where ever you are', that's something to be learned not just for MS admission process but for life as well. :D3. Statement of Purpose (SOP):I personally feel that SOP is a big deciding factor in your admission. You can be a lot of different by writing an excellent SOP. Your SOP will say a lot of thing about you silently that a strong profile will never be able to speak out. SOP tells your attitude, your ambition, your clarity of thought and your personality. These sometime overweight excellent profiles. This video will help you realize the importance of a good SOP (UMass Amherst Admission Committee):Also if you want to read more about it, check the link at the end of the answer.4. Work/Research ex, GRE and LOR:I will prefer not to rank them in a strict order because they will depend on the type of program you are applying to. If you are applying for a research based program, your research/work ex and LOR will be of higher value than GRE, but if may be it is not a specifically research based MS program, then if is possible that GRE may matter more. A good GRE score will certainly help. Score above 310 is considered okay-okay.... may be descent... 320+ is desirable and good... 330+ is excellent. AWA also matters and 3.0+ is almost like mandatory... 4/4+ is good. Work/research ex is helpful not just during MS application process but also after completing your MS when job hunting. A relevant work ex is recommended and good, but if you have work ex in a different field than what you are going to study, no promises can be made if it will help.If you are interested in doing some research work and gain some research experience before applying for MS you can apply as RA at IITs under a prof. Here are some details on that: http://www.edulix.com/forum/show... LORs are important mainly for PhD programs. they do add some weight to the application, but only if a prominent professor from a premier institute or a high ranking official from work place writes it. It is also important to send the LOR only using the official university/company mail id of the prof/boss, else although acceptable, they will add ZERO points to application.Finally I will add the uncertainty factor: LUCK. :D Although they say ""The harder I work, the luckier I get.""Update: To include all the rest of the factors involved in the admission process.THESE FACTORS WILL VARY FROM CASE TO CASE:1. Final Year Project (FYP):Check this too: Mihir Gupta's answer to Which kind of project should I do so that I can show it in my resume for MS in US? This is also one of the important deciding factors for admission, especially for one applying for MS with thesis. It will demonstrate your ability to convert your theoretical know-how into practical engineering knowledge. Also if your project is good enough, you can get a paper out of it and publish it. Sometimes, if he admission process involves an interview with a prof who is willing to take you as RA/TA, then the FYP is very important as mos of the interview questions will be from the project.2. Internships and Papers:Internship that are usually undertaken by B.Tech students in 3rd or 4th year matter only if they project assigned to them is a good one and it they do it from a reputed firm like IISC, DRDO, or some big pvt companies. Here the important thing will also be to work for a longer time as one month's internship won't be of any use. If you work for a minimum 3 months and are also able to impress your boss such that he is willing to give you recommendation, that will be the best case scene. It is also possible to try score internships abroad in a university or a company. They are a big plus for overall profile.Research papers published during the final year project or internship will help those who wish to go for MS with thesis option but not very much for students aiming for MS without thesis (MEngg; 1 yr course). The impact factor of the journal you have published your work in will be considered, but not much as adcom do not expect a high quality research work from an undergrad unless it is a direct PhD application.3. Co/Extra-curricular:These activities will not offer you any major advantage, but will make your resume/CV look bright and show that you are involved in activities other than acads. If you do not have good acads and bad GRE, then these activities will be of zero importance, on the other hand if you profile is good and you have done some nice activities, then these will provide you an edge over student who has profile similar to yours.4. Prof-Letting:This is useful only when you think you have good admission chances and that you want to work under a prof as RA/TA under a prof during MS. For this the credentials responsible will differ. Of course acads will still hold importance, but after that will come your work ex, research ex, papers, project and LOR. There is a method required to contact profs of the desired university. You can read all about it in the link at the end of the answer.PROBLEMS PEOPLE MIGHT FACE:1. Backlogs:Don't feel disappointed if you have had a few backlogs. Although your list of universities will be a bit different compared to the one who had no backlogs, but you still do have a good chance to succeed. For this I will again link you to this guy who had 55 backlogs and still got admit and visa as well. All you need is strong motivation, hard work and will power.Backlog in a core subject, the one you are selecting your specialization for MS will hurt bad, but if it is in an unrelated subject, it will probably not be that bad.2. Year Gap:If you completed your UG in 2012 and did nothing till June 2013, then it will be called a year gap. If you worked for a major part of that year (6/6+ months) then its not probably not a year gap.Some year gaps are acceptable. Like you took a year off to work in an NGO or may be for (Teach For India) TFI or something like that, then it is acceptable.The other case may be that you were preparing for GATE or any other exam. This will be a negative factor for your profile unless you did great in that exam and that exam somehow added to your profile (like good GATE score is valuable for German universities).The third case can be that you were search for job and by the end you decided to take GRE for MS. This will have really bad effect on your profile, unless you can cover it with something valuable you might have done side by side.3. Plagiarism:This is kind of an indirect factor that may affect your chances of admit, BUT if found guilty, you may not just receive reject from the university you applied to but also from other universities you are going to apply to. Plagiarism is a serious issue when it comes to higher studies. So my advice will be DO NOT try to copy anything.So if you find my answers helpful, do endorse me for topics.LINKS (For any help use Edulix - Premier Site for Scholars - 'Education Crowd-Sourced'.

More importantly, once you achieve something around 167 and above in quant and 160 and above in Verbal, even GRE does not matter. These days a lot of Indian students are applying with GRE scores of 325+, so I do not think GRE will pull you up, unless you get 335+ (but anything less than 315 will pull you down).What matters --1) CGPA (higher the CGPA better are your chances. Anything with 9 pointer above will be a good bet).2) Rank (if your university of college gives you a recognised rank then say your CGPA is 8, but still you are second in class, then it shall help your case).3) Name of the institute. Better recongized is your institute, better are your chances. For example: names such as IIT, NIT or BITS do hold value.4) Internships -- If you have internship at IIT or some other good US university, then you have brighter chances of achieving an admission. If you have internships at top multinationals (such as for CS guys microsoft, IBM labs, intel, samsung and so on) then also you can secure a good MS program. Your internship at a startup can also help you, if the work done is good. The main point to understand is at the end of the day, work matters.5) If you have research papers or some academic awards or grants, then it will help you pass through a good MS program. Publishing researh papers does not mean that a person publishes 10 papers, but the conference or journal is not even recognized. Even if you have a single paper, but from a reputed organization, then it is far better than ten.6) Contacts with foreign univeristy profesor. If you have any interaction with the professor of the college of your choice, then you have an edge.7) SOP -- A golden rule, write the truth and not stories. State your achivements and your study plans, group to join and professor to work with.PS: Thanx to Nikhil Prabhu for edits","Dear GRE aspirant,Do you think that modest GRE scores and backlogs would hold back a profile? No, definitely not.To help you in understanding this claim better, I have a chart* with three GREedge alumni with modest GRE scores and backlogs.*Data obtained from GREedge’s Admission Counselling TeamSo, these profiles are indeed testimony to the fact that apart from your GRE score, a host of other factors determine the status of your admits. Now that you know this, I’m sure you are wondering what these factors are. Based on my experience as the Co-founder of GREedge, I would like to share them with you.Before you get to these factors, you must know the application process to know how universities shortlist candidates. This would give you a background of what universities look for in a prospective candidate. A general flow of the application process would look like this:Over the evaluation process, Universities, in general, look to scrutinize you on a holistic basis.The evaluation begins by examining your CGPA and a host of other factors. Some of these factors include the scores of your admission requirement tests, Letter of Recommendation, Statement of Purpose/essay among the rest. So, clearly understand what universities use as a sieve in screening your application.Most universities have some common filters. Some of them include:Competitive GPA: Once your application package reaches the university, it is immediately forwarded to the Graduate Department. The first scrutiny that is made on the application is the “test of your GPA”. Your GPA speaks volumes about your application. If you are a rank-holder or if you have a consistent academic track record, then you can definitely expect some weightage. Countries like the U.S. and Germany place a huge emphasis on GPAs. For example, Georgia Tech requires an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better to pursue a Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (MS-HCI). Though you cannot completely balance your profile with high GPA, a consistent and competitive GPA will definitely add substantial value to your profile. In addition to your GPA, the following academic factors will give your application an edge too.TOEFL/IELTS: A great deal of emphasis is placed on your IELTS or TOEFL score apart from your GRE score. Most universities require a good TOEFL or IELTS score. For example, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, requires a minimum of 90 points in the Internet-based TOEFL (iBT). Georgia Tech, on the other hand, for the MS-HCI program, requires a minimum of 100 in TOEFL. Universities emphasize on TOEFL/IELTS scores to determine the status of TA/RA. Further, IELTS and TOEFL scores are also taken into account in determining the quantum of your scholarships and fellowships. Keep it a point to research on the minimum requirements. A TOEFL score over 100 or IELTS score over 7 will indeed add value to your profile.Letter of Recommendation: The basic purpose of the Letter of Recommendation is to get a person to vouch for your credentials. This, no doubt, adds value to your profile. Ensure that you get two or three Letters of Recommendation. The Letter of Recommendation must come from someone who has been associated with you. It can be your university professor or your senior at workplace. Further, it will also add value if the person who recommends you has a PhD. So, make it a point to get a commendable Letter of Recommendation and this will indeed boost the value of your profile.Statement of Purpose: Your SOP is just like your personal interview with the Admission Committee. Convey all that you want the Admission Committee to know about your profile.Your Statement of Purpose must be genuine and convincing. Make it a point to highlight the drive behind your Master’s program. Answer all possible questions, such as:1. Your degree of interest in your chosen field 2. What made you apply for the particular university 3. Why did you choose the particular courseEnsure that you don’t leave out any relevant information. Make it a point to highlight all your academic achievements and professional goals. Always remember that your SOP is as good as an interview. So, draft a compelling SOP that would persuade the Admission Committee to consider your profile.You can keep the following guidelines in your mind while you draft your SOP:Paper Publication and Research Work: Having a good number of paper publications and research work will show that you had been in touch with the academic community. Ensure that you have your papers published in international journals. Also, if you had participated in international conferences, ensure that you highlight them. A good number of paper publications and research work will indeed add points to your applications. So, even if you have not published any papers until now, get started with it.

The prospect of moving to a strange country, meeting new friends and living independently cannot fail to excite anyone. It really comes as no surprise, then, that the Ministry of External Affairs reported that as many as 7.5 lakh Indian students are studying abroad in 2018, with the numbers only predicted to rise in the coming years.With the US and Canada retaining top spots as the preferred study abroad destinations, (with 2.1 lakh and 1 lakh Indian students respectively) it goes without saying, then, that the competition for seats at universities in these two countries can get incredibly stiff.eBook Download: USA or Canada - What’s the right choice for MSAdd to that the high costs of application fees, and it becomes paramount to ensure that your application quality is top-notch and helps you put your best foot forward. So how exactly can you do this, and guarantee for yourself an offer letter to your dream university? What are the various credentials that you need to focus on to build a stellar application package?GRE scores: Needless to say, a high GRE score is capable of working magic on your profile, and can both elevate the quality of a mediocre application, and further boost the worthiness of a quality profile. A high Verbal score proves your robust command over the English language and implicitly your ability to handle living and studying in an English-speaking country, while an excellent performance on the Quant section can unlock all kinds of rewarding scholarships and Teaching/Research assistantship positions. Download eBook: Quant guide for a perfect 170 ScoreDownload eBook: Ultimate guide to crack GRE VerbalWhile the GRE is an indispensable part of most US university applications, that is not the case in Canada, Germany where language proficiency tests take precedence over the GRE. However, there are several reputed schools even in Canada that require or accept GRE scores as a part of graduate applications. Here’s a glimpse at some of the top Canadian universities that accept GRE scores, and their respective GRE requirements:Download the ebook GRE Cutoff Scores for Top 35 UniversitiesTOEFL/IELTS score: Both the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) are accepted at universities in Canada, Germany and the US, and seek to assess your command and fluency over the English language. Your ability to read, write, speak and listen comfortably in English will be gauged, and a score will be given accordingly. In countries apart from USA, this lays a very important role in the admission committee’s mind as it gives a reflection of your communication abilities. In the TOEFL iBT (Internet Based Test), each of the four sections will be marked between 0 to 30 for a possible total score of 120. On the IELTS, marks are allotted between 0 to 9, with 0.5 increments. You will be given an individual band score for each skill, in addition to an overall score. A good TOEFL score is anything between 100 to 120, while a score of 7.5 and above is generally regarded as a good IELTS score. While the IELTS enjoys a worldwide acceptance, the TOEFL is generally used in the US, although all American universities also accept IELTS scores. Owing to its versatility, IELTS scores are valid in over 10,000 institutions and universities worldwide, including countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany.Download eBook: A Definitive Guide for IELTS hereAcademic GPA: One of the most crucial factors that impact your admission chances would be your GPA referred to as CGPA or percentages in a lot of Indian Institutions. Given the fact that a student’s CGPA does not completely reflect the student’s potential but to a certain extent about the faculty, college & competition in the university, it’s seen as a relative criterion. To explain in simple words, your GPA is considered as good or bad depending on your topper’s GPA. Also, each country requires your to convert your GPA to scale of 4. Read about how to convert your GPA for USA, Canada & Germany here>>Statement of Purpose: The Statement of Purpose, or the SOP, is a crucial ingredient to a successful application. Because universities abroad typically receive hundreds of applications with similar credentials, your SOP is your one chance to showcase your individuality and your dreams and aspirations, and set yourself apart from your peers. The SOP is commonly thought to be a replacement for the personal interview, and for that reason, it is crucial that you nail it just right. For the lowdown on how to craft the perfect winning SOP, make sure you checkout our top tips and tricks!Download ebook: How To Craft A Winning SOP >>Letters of Recommendation: Written by former professors or employers, the LOR is an important testament to your intellectual and personal character, and is essentially a promise from one professor to another that you are an intelligent, diligent student, and deserving of an admit. Ideally, you should get LORs from professors who have supervised your thesis or research project, Heads of Departments, or from professors who have taught you and known you for a substantial period of time, especially if they are well-known in their field and have published extensively. You can also submit LORs from employers, although it is recommended you only do this if you’ve been out of college for a few years.Work and research experience: As a fresh undergraduate, you aren’t typically expected to have work experience apart from the usual internship or voluntary work. However, if you do have such experience, make sure to highlight it in your CV and SOP. Most applicants tend to apply to graduate school straight after finishing undergrad, and view work experience as a filler, but work experience not only allows you to gain a fresh perspective on the world, but also facilitates the development of new, life-defining skills, and the ability to work in and lead diverse groups of people, all of which are paramount to graduate applications. As far as research is concerned, do remember, universities in the US are vastly different from Indian ones, especially because of the onus they place on research and development, to the extent where applicants with a relatively lower GPA have won admits to top schools based purely on their excellent research experience in the past. If you have substantial research experience, it would be a good idea to get your research supervisors to write you a reference letter, and also issue you any relevant certificates. Both research and work experience are especially beneficial in making up for any shortfalls in you GPA or GRE scores, and also in getting scholarships and other aid.What are the common mistakes students make while applying?Time, as they say, is money, and this is especially true for MS applications, where every single day is of prime importance. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that you plan your application well in advance and follow a proper timeline so that you don’t find yourself floundering for time. So what are some of the mistakes that trip up study abroad aspirants? Let’s take a look:Starting GRE preparation late: Your GRE, as we mentioned, is one of the most important building blocks of your application, so ideally, you must give yourself sufficient time to start preparing for the test, so you can identify your weak points and work on them properly. You also need to have enough time so that if you find your GRE scores unsatisfactory, you can choose to rewrite it.Inability to shortlist universities: Of course, Harvard, MIT and Caltech are the dream of millions, but realistically, is your profile compatible with the stringent requirements of these universities? Before applying, draw up a list of 8-10 universities you would like to attend, based on criteria such as GRE requirements, tuition fee, acceptance rate, past admits, alum profiles, cultural & research field compatibility with faculty etc. Remember, you will be spending quite a bit on application fees, so make sure you don’t waste time and money on schools that are unrealistically out of your league.Download The SELECT Strategy to Shortlist Universities eBOOK hereLacking the relevant details about deadlines and requirements: Universities in the US and Canada are extremely strict about the application deadlines: for instance, for fall admit, applications usually close in the first week of December of the previous year. Many aspirants often fail to take cognizance of deadlines, or neglect to send in their applications keeping in mind the time it would take to reach the US. A good idea is to note down the application deadlines of the various programs you want to apply to, well in advance. Do remember that if you are applying for a scholarship, deadlines are typically earlier. Additionally, many schools have an early bird round, which closes much before the usual deadlines. Applying in an early bird round greatly improves your chances at an offer letter, so if you’re ready, you can send in your applications right in time for that!Consulting unofficial/inaccurate/random websites: The internet is a quagmire of information, and it is easy to fall into a trap of misinformation if you are not careful. While researching for application information, be sure to stick to only the university’s official websites. If you are still doubtful or have any questions, be sure to write to the admissions help desk of the university to be sure.Sending an incomplete or inadequate application: Applying overseas is not as straightforward as applying to universities in India: there is a lot more paperwork involved, such as healthcare insurance, transcripts, and visas, and in order to prevent your application from being summarily rejected, you need to ensure that your application package is complete. Overwhelmed?Don’t worry. Please find the MS application checklist right below to help you plan your entire application process.Download the eBOOK “MS Admit: The Application Checklist” hereWe hope you found this information useful, and now have some clarity on the various building blocks to ensuring an offer letter to your dream university.

GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It's ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!You could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your termsKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms","It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.You’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.You’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.You have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it. You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door. But, remember ‘freelancing job is also an actual job’. There’s nothing fancy about it until you make it.Before you are a freelancer you should prepare for being one. These is a simple road-map which you need to follow with determination, to make through this challenge.ACQUIRING SKILLS:This is the most important part. You need to acquire skills in whatever field you choose. You may find this boring and have an urge to jump over and look up to the offers. You may have misconceptions of having all necessary skills.

Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.MANAGING NETWORKSLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.Now that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.BEING THE BRANDThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.You need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help. Get your business cards and be ready to talk about the work you do and yourself more often.Learn some basic marketing and accounting skills. Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.THE ADVENTURE RIDENow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!Start looking out for jobs.

The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.This answer is a part of my blog, read it here.If you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.Please do let me know your suggestions and feedback.I’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.","For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.That doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.But I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.For example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”To that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.Of course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.Here are a few:You learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.There are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.It’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.You get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?Freelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.Bottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.And you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.If you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.On the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.Once you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.","Let’s start step by step:1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.If you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:Freelancer - Hire & Find JobsUpworkCraigslistPeoplePerHour99designsGuruEngineerBabuHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.2. Build a Perfect websiteAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.While building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.Show diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.Include your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.If you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.3. Brand YourselfOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-Whether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.Along with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.Your logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.Most importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.The domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.Become a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.4. Understand the project requirement carefullyAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.The only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.9. Be ProfessionalWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-Starting date of projectThe project’s deadlineMilestonesFunctionalitiesSchedule meeting in priorMake the clear timeline of deliverables.Professionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–Keep Your Personal Life limited to yourselfYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.  It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.Charge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.Schedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.If some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.Build the right association.It is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.Follow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.Don’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.Be positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.10. Networking and Relationship with ClientsBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..Some useful techniques to grow your network.1. Increase your Social Media Network  Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.  2. Attend events You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.3.

GRE,How good is a GRE score of 302?,https://www.quora.com//How-good-is-a-GRE-score-of-302,"GRE Score, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",17,"Universities look at a candidates complete profile. Let’s take your case as an example since you have done a great job in providing most of your details. What do universities look at when evaluating a profile:Quantitative scores: Grades, GRE scores etc. Your latest grade, 67% in BE, is an average score. Your GRE score, all sections are on the lower side. For MS in any engineering or science program, universities place importance on Quants, then AW, then verbal. So score above 163–165 on Quants, at least 4.0 on AW and above the minimum required for verbal (which should be listed on the universities website) or at the very least 1 standard deviation below the average (some universities list average scores instead of minimum). I recommend reading GRE Scores - The Good, Bad and Ugly for in depth insights on GRE scores.Ranking of your bachelor’s university: A 60% in IIT is valued much more than 90% in a Sido Kanhu Murmu University type university.SOP: This is the heart of your application. A well written statement can get you into your top choice university. A well-thought out SOP has the following qualities:Unique. It has to be about you. Your story, your goals, your personality should shine through, reasons why you want to apply to this particular university etc. Uniqueness gives rise to…Authenticity. Be genuine. Don’t make up stories or challenges you overcame. Authenticity also comes from…Depth. When thinking about your goals, the reasons you want to apply to a university, focus on depth. The more you think about reasons for each and every decision, the more authentic it will be. Keep asking yourself questions. Don’t settle on an answer till you’re satisfied with it. Get to the point where no one can break through your reasoning for any decision. With depth comes…Specifics. Answer each question with details. If you can’t answer a question, research. Find out why you want to go to a particular university or why you want to apply to a particular degree. Write out specifics in…Simple, effective language. There’s no need for eloquent literature or Shakespearean English. Keep it simple, clear and easily understandable while also being…To the point. Don’t beat around the bush. Write crisp sentences, get your point across quickly and move on to the next point.I have a detailed blog post about the must haves in your statement of purpose.LOR: Just like a restaurant has to have great reviews before you eat there, so do you to get into a good university. It seems that you have this covered.With all this in mind (and without reading your SOP), I think USF, ASU and Northeastern are safe choices. You’re on the borderline for UF and UTD.Good luck!Edit:Additionally, a score of 302 for your GRE is on the lower side. Your best bet is to increase your GRE scores above 310 or 315.I’ve captured this sentiment in depth here! Enjoy!","Ruili, both the verbal and quantitative GRE scores have a range from 130 to 170 - average 150. So the combined average is 300. Thus 302 is a shade above average. In my opinion it would not, by itself, gain you entry to a good school for a Master's in CS. Sorry!  But are you not rather late for admission in the Fall of 2015? Best wishes.On another point which applies to many QUORA questions, see below on the confidentiality of GRE scores. All GRE score users should be aware of the confidential nature of the scores and agree to maintain their confidentiality. Institutional policies should be developed to ensure that confidentiality is maintained. For example, GRE scores should not be placed on documents sent outside the institution.","Thanks for A2AA GRE score of 302 can take you places...maybe not the Ivy Leagues and the top 10 grad-schools, but places nonetheless!What Universities Can I Target with GRE: 300-310?To start with, here are a few of the ‘achievable’ universities you can target with a GRE score in the range of 300-310:Texas A&M KingsvilleSUNY BuffaloSUNY Stony BrookUT-DallasUT-ArlingtonSJSUThe University of Louisiana - LafayetteIllinois Institute of Technology - ChicagoRochester Institute of TechnologyUniversity of HoustonDownload GRE Cutoff scores for top 35 US Universities hereBut does this mean you can’t target the TOP 25 with your score?GRE score requirements are not concrete, and there are several instances of students who land above-average or top admits, despite a GRE score not even close to the university average score of admitted students. We’ll analyze a few of those profiles at the end, so if that’s what you’re looking for, just scroll to the bottom of the answer!Let’s now find out how good a 300-310 GRE score is in terms of both percentiles and required GRE scores of some popular programs.Is 302 a Good Score?The truth is, the universities don’t look at your total GRE score, but the individual scores obtained in the Verbal, Quant, and even the AWA section - though it’s marked separately. Hence, how good your score is, depends on these factors:Your Verbal & Quants percentile scoresThe GRE score required for that program/university.Checkout our eBOOK on 5 Techniques to score 170 in QuantsLet’s talk percentiles. Percentiles are a measure of what percentage of other GRE takers have a score lower than you. Hence, the higher your percentile, the better your chances!ETS, the organization that conducts the GRE calculates percentiles separately for Verbal, Quant, and AWA.As you mentioned, you have a 144 and 158 on your Verbal and Quants section respectively.Take a look at your individual score percentiles below (source: ETS)Decoding the Data - What matters more for you?Broadly speaking you need a higher score on the section more closely related to your field. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) Courses like Computer Science, in your case, place more emphasis on a higher Quants percentile whereas Ph.D. courses in thesis-based subjects often require a higher verbal score!Noticed how the Verbal percentiles are higher than Quant percentiles throughout?The difference between verbal and quants scores is especially more pronounced in countries such as India where more students score better in the Quants section owing to a higher priority given to developing mathematical skills coupled with the engineering background that most test-takers share! Thus, to get a higher Quants percentile, you’d need a higher Quants score than Verbal!Aiming for a high Quants Score? Then Download GRE Quant Formula Book for a perfect 170 ScoreWhat is a Good Percentile?Roughly speaking, any score above the 50% mark is considered good, with a percentile above 70% considered excellent!This means, a score of 151 or more on Verbal and 153 or more in Quant is considered good. Anything below that and it means that most test-takers scored higher than you.Given the fact that your Quants score is 158, and you’re applying to a STEM course, you’re already at an advantage - with your score being higher than almost 70% of test takers!Now, coming to what you really wanted to know…What is the BEST you can target with your score?Your admits are only as good as your profile is - of which your GRE is JUST one part!The internet is jam-packed with the score requirements of universities and the average GRE scores of students admitted.But does that mean that these boundaries are set in stone? Definitely not!There are several instances of students who land above-average or top admits, despite a GRE score that’s even close to the average score of admitted students.You can also get into some very prestigious universities by applying to niche courses, or having skills that aren’t really commonplace. Applying to universities with a large intake like say, SJSU or USC helps too!So what else do the universities consider?

GRE,What will happen after clearing GRE?,https://www.quora.com//What-will-happen-after-clearing-GRE,"Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exams and Tests",9,"Having gone through the graduate school application process twice (unfortunately), I think I can contribute to this.First of all, there is no CLEARING the GRE. GRE is not like your regular school/college exams where you have to get a minimum score to clear the cutoff; you are not declared passed or failed. The score you get on GRE reflects your understanding of verbal and basic mathematics.Now, this is the sequence of steps that one usually follows after GRE for admission in a graduate school:Writing English proficiency test: if the student is an international aspirant from a country that does not have English as its first language, he/she is usually required to take the test of English proficiency. The common ones are TOEFL and IELTS.Shortlisting universities: Carefully selecting the universities based on your profile, area of interest, budget, reputation, market value etc. Usually aspirants apply for 6-10 universities to be safe.Getting the transcripts: The schools you are going to apply to will ask for you academic records from the institution you received/pursuing your under graduate degree from. This is often a time consuming process (specially if your under graduate institute is not in United States).Writing a statement of purpose: Graduate schools usually require an essay outlining your interests and reasons behind pursuing graduate studies. This is considered a pivotal aspect of your application and calls for investing time.Getting letters of recommendations: You might be asked to provide letters of recommendations (usually three) from either your professors during you under graduate studies or from your colleagues if you are a working professional. The recommendation process is now online in most of the university applications. The person willing to recommend you gets a link via email (on his email id that you provide during application process) and uses that link to upload your letter of recommendation. However, some universities may ask for a hard copy.Completing the online application process: The application process for most of the schools is online. The application fee varies from 0 USD to 110 USD, depending upon the university and depending upon whether you are an international applicant or local. You might be asked to upload your statement of purpose and the scanned copy of your transcripts during online application process.Sending the packet: Some universities require the transcripts to be sent to them via post before they make a decision regarding your application. You will need to post your transcripts to the university if you are an international applicant. Having said that, most of the universities do not want an original transcript copy for the purpose of making a decision about your application; the scanned copy uploaded during online application is enough.Sending GRE (and TOEFL if you are an international applicant) scores to the university via ETS : The universities might ask you to self report the scores during online application process but most often they will ask you to report the scores via ETS too. The self reporting is only for faster processing your applicant.WAIT! : The above steps usually complete the application process to a graduate school and now starts the tough part; the long wait for decisions. It usually takes one to three months for the universities to make a decision regarding your application.After you have been offered an admit: If you are an international student, once you receive an offer for admission, you will be asked to show enough financial support for your graduate studies at that university. On receiving your financial documents, they will forward you a document called I20. This document is required for you to get a student visa.Student visa: If you are an international student, you will need to get a student visa. This is the final step.The above steps are what generally follows the GRE. I have answered this question assuming that you are an international student trying to get admission in a school in United States/Germany.","Thanks for the A2A!Taking the GRE is only the first step in a long journey to your dream university abroad.The important thing to keep in mind here, before you start the application process, is that most students applying to these universities abroad have cleared the same academic hurdles as you i.e. most students will have comparable GRE scores and grades. So now is the time to take a good, hard look at your overall profile. Good grades and test scores are great. But they’re only a part of the package- you’ll need more to stand out from the crowd.Once you’ve decided which season you want to apply to and have you scores in hand, you can move on to shortlisting the universities you want to apply to.University shortlisting- Do not rush through this process. Do your research. Look not only at your profile while applying but also consider other factors about the university- job prospects, location, cost. Do not limit the number of universities you list initially, you can shorten the list once you’re aware of all of your options.Statement of purpose- This is what I was referring to when I said you’ll need something that helps you stand out of the crowd. Your SOP should accurately reflect the i)work you’ve done so far, ii)why you would be a good fit for the university, iii)why the university would be a good fit for you AND iv)what you plan on doing once you’ve received your education. A well-written SOP can give you an edge while a poorly-written SOP can knock you down a few points- even if your grades are strong.Transcripts- Ensure your transcripts are ready on time and that theyre in the right format so that they meet the requirements of the universities.LORs- You will, typically, need three LORs from people who’ve worked with you- professors, managers. They will be asked to write the LOR and send it over the online portal. You do have the option of seeing what they’re written about you. However, waiving your right to see what they’ve written is considered good practice. It makes you come across as more confident and respectful of the process. LORs are, after-all, supposed to be confidential.Financial aid- If you haven’t already applied for financial aid from the university, you will have to consider applying to external sources (banks, loan providers) sometime after you’ve submitted your documents. Look up potential loan providers in the time that you’re waiting for results. Once you receive admits, you’ll need to get in touch with them and get started on the process.There are other things you will need to do as well, such as getting your VISA. But essentially, these are the main steps you will need to start thinking about once you’ve completed taking the GRE. If you’re yet to take the GRE, here are two great prep apps for you- Ultimate GRE prep & Ultimate Vocabulary Prep.I hope this helps!Good luck!","Once you’re done with your GRE and obtained a satisfactory score, you will start feeling relaxed thinking, “Well, now my job’s done”. It won’t be long enough when you’ll realise that appearing for the GRE exam was just the beginning. The major chunk of the work still remains.List of important steps after the GRE exam:1. Appear for TOEFL or IELTS:TOEFL isn’t an important criterion for withholding your admission process. Basically, TOEFL or IELTS are tests of your English skills. Their role comes into play at the time of Visa and during your Teaching Assistantship (TA). But it is always better that you are done with all the exams before applying to the universities.Ideal Time: September-October2. Decide Course and University:This is probably the most important and the most hectic time you will go through. You should choose a course purely based on your interest. Usually, students opt for a course based on their undergrad stream, although you can apply to any other different course. The only important part is that you should be able to justify to yourself why you want a course different from your undergrad stream, perhaps in your SOP.Work should begin on deciding a course and a university around September third week, earlier the better. You can go through Yocket's list of universities and courses for detailed information.The next step is to arrange documents. This is, as usual, tedious and boring. You have to run here and there, from the office on the first floor to the HOD on the 4th floor, each will keep dumping the work on the other. It isn’t so easy to obtain transcripts, LORs, attested mark sheets and Bank Statements. As said before, earlier you engage in this work lesser will be the problems.Below is a brief explanation on how and when you should arrange these documents:3. Letters of Recommendation:Assuming you’re still a student, as soon as the final year begins, start talking to the respective professors who will give you a recommendation. Honestly, it isn’t that simple to get a reco (as adorably it is said) unless you have an excellent rapport with the teacher. It is a long process as you have to make a lot of rough drafts and eventually ready the final document.4. Transcripts:A transcript is an official document which comprises all your marks in detail (Semester-wise, subject-wise breakups, term work & viva marks) in a single sheet and is issued by your college. You have to make frequent visits to your college office for getting the sample transcript, entering the complete details of all the subjects starting from semester 1 till the current semester, approving it, getting it stamped and then sealing it. Number of copies required are around 15.5. Bank StatementFrankly speaking, arranging this document isn’t very difficult. Firstly, you need to know how much are you willing to, or in other words, how much can you spend for the next two years in USA (roughly around USD 55,000). Talk to your bank manager and get attested copies of the bank statement which is a proof of your financial solvency.6. AffidavitAn affidavit is similar to the bank statement, just that it is an official document issued by the Government and it states who will be financing your education. You can make an affidavit by simply going to the court and telling the lawyer the exact details to fill in.7. Statement Of PurposeThe heart of your application process. This is the only document which is supposedly compulsory. Start making your SOP around October if you’re applying for Fall intake as you have to make a lot of rough drafts for a week or 10 days. Get a few opinions from your seniors (to see whether you have written all the data properly) and an English expert (for the language and the grammar).Suggestion: Although you may have secured a good GRE score, try to keep the language simple and make sure you focus more on the content rather than flaunting your knowledge of GRE words.8. ResumeIt is a document highlighting your achievements. It usually consists of your academic achievements, GRE and TOEFL scores, Co-curricular and extracurricular activities, explanation of your academic projects and personal details. A good time to engage in making a Resume would be mid October.9. Applying to Univerities:Start filling the form even if your SOP isn’t ready (usually it’s not ready). Enter your recommender’s email address as early as possible. The university will send an email to them and they will complete the rest of the procedure. Recommender’s are EXTREMELY SLOW. You have to keep reminding them frequently.10. Prepare and Send Packets:Packet (in application terms) is a set of documents enclosed in an envelope which is to be mailed physically to a university. A packet generally consists of Cover Letter, Resume, Transcripts, Affidavit etc.Letters of Recommendation and Statement of Purpose are to be uploaded directly within the Application Form. Over the last few years, many universities have made a provision of uploading all the documents in their application form including official transcripts. So, suggest you check with the concerned university before sending any packet. If your university requires physical documents, you can send your packet via Yocket's trusted partners at a very competitive price.11. Choosing the Right University from Admits:It is important for you to check the available options, compare and select the best university you wish to pursue your higher education at. You can read this piece to know what factors to consider to choose your final university.12. Get Your F1 US Student VisaOnce you’ve finalised your university, you need to obtain a document called I-20 from your university. It tells the U.S. government that you are eligible for F-1 Student Status. Next you to apply for a student visa. Here’s a small guide to help you with thatThat’s it ! Once your visa is approved, buy your tickets and fly to your dream university abroad.","Dear GRE Aspirant,First, I would like to clarify by stating that there is no definite pass/fail mark in GRE. Unlike in India, where individuals have their “cut-offs,” GRE examines your analytical skills, including critical reasoning and quantitative capacity. It evaluates the verbal and mathematical skills, and also your ability to develop arguments and write coherently through two writing sections. You start applying to universities after you write your GRE. Even when you take your GRE test, you can apply in up to four schools for free at the test center.The admission process for graduate school in the US is as follows:Admission Session (Season): Decide which session you are going to apply for admissions. Certain schools have intakes during the Spring and Summer sessions, but all schools have a Fall intake.Examination: Once you have decided on the season, fix your test dates, including the GRE and TOEFL, at least two and a half months before the deadline. With such planning, you get sufficient time to evaluate and retake the exam, if necessary.Universities search: Make sure you do a thorough search of the Universities and ensure their authenticity. Also keep top State schools in mind, as Ivy leagues are not the only good schools in the country. Targeting about 10 schools is ideal.Statement of Purpose: This is one of the most important aspects of the application. The statement of purpose (SOP) is section to make the best impression for the admissions counselor to move the application further. The SOP usually includes your interests, reason to pursue the chosen degree at that institution and career goals. This requires about a months’ work depending on the number on universities applied to.Transcripts: Ensure your transcripts meet the requirements of the universities. Since India follows a different form grading, make sure you get your transcript converted to the US system through certified agencies like Educational Perspective. (http://www.edperspective.org).Recommendation Letters: Most universities require three letters of recommendation from current or former professors who can assess the candidate’s academic standing or employers who can provide the professional qualifications of the candidate. As many in India might not be familiar with the process, an email will be sent to the recommender and he or she will have to submit the recommendation through the online portal. A personal recommendation would be for the student to waive their right to see the recommendations as the letters are often considered confidential.Sending supplemental documents: Universities would requests transcripts to be mailed out to them. On most occasions, unofficial transcripts can be mailed out for the purposes of making an admission offer and the official transcript would have to be sent out after the offer has been made. Certain universities, however, require official transcripts to make a decision.GRE scores and TOEFL scores (for International applicants): Most Universities requires GRE and TOEFL scores while applying. On most occasions, the scores are self-reported, however, some may require them to be reported through the ETS website. TOEFL scores are usually needed only for international applicants.Awaiting decision: Once the application is submitted, one has to wait for about four to eight weeks for the decision, depending on when application was submitted.Visa: Once the admissions have been offered, for an international student, the financial background will be evaluated, to pursue graduate education in their institution. Once they evaluate the documents, the I-20 form will be sent and the student can apply for the visa.Start preparing for GRE at least three months in advance for a high score and this would allow you to reach your dream score. Consistency and planning during the preparing is key. Last minute cramming would not get you very far because the GRE tests your conceptual understanding rather than rote learning. Ensure you give yourself sufficient time to prepare by taking a diagnostic tests and understanding where you stand. This will help you set the right expectations about your target scores and chalk out a definitive study plan from there.Thus, Prepare ahead and score wellWe wish you all the best.PS: If you are looking for GRE preparation courses that will help you achieve your target score, then visit www.GREedge.com"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It's ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!You could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your termsKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms","It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.You’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.You’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.You have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it. You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door. But, remember ‘freelancing job is also an actual job’. There’s nothing fancy about it until you make it.Before you are a freelancer you should prepare for being one. These is a simple road-map which you need to follow with determination, to make through this challenge.ACQUIRING SKILLS:This is the most important part. You need to acquire skills in whatever field you choose. You may find this boring and have an urge to jump over and look up to the offers. You may have misconceptions of having all necessary skills. But, this is the only way you can be successful in long run.Take a break to start an elaborated research in the chosen field and the specializations they demand.Look out for dummy projects to build a great portfolio. Offer to work with your peers, friends and nonprofit organizations for free.Keep a close look at people already in the industry and look up to their work. Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.MANAGING NETWORKSLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.Now that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.BEING THE BRANDThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.You need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help. Get your business cards and be ready to talk about the work you do and yourself more often.Learn some basic marketing and accounting skills. Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.THE ADVENTURE RIDENow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!Start looking out for jobs. This might be a slow-moving process, instead of getting stressed introspect your offers.At first work on project/job expecting limited or no money at all. This is to just make connection sharpening your skills and showcasing your talent. These resources might be helpful to start off: Upwork, Guru, Elance, PeoplePerHour, Freelancer, Craig list;Once you have built a quality portfolio and demonstrated your work it’s time to hunt big offers. Serve the clients with generosity, build a rapport. Businesses will start taking you seriously about your specialization.Your career will see a boost. In the long run, you can either be choosy about your project or take projects in volumes, both are keys to success. With time, you’ll be able to create a Brand which clients and businesses will look up to.Finally, keep up the good work and regularly meet other freelancers, talk them about your business. Use calling more often than emailing to a client. These things will give your brand a personal touch and also avoid the feeling of isolation. Now, you are independent and can set your own working ethics being selective about projects and jobs. The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.This answer is a part of my blog, read it here.If you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.Please do let me know your suggestions and feedback.I’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.","For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.That doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.But I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.For example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”To that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.Of course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.Here are a few:You learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.There are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.It’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.You get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?Freelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.Bottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.And you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.If you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.On the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.Once you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.","Let’s start step by step:1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.If you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:Freelancer - Hire & Find JobsUpworkCraigslistPeoplePerHour99designsGuruEngineerBabuHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.2. Build a Perfect websiteAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.While building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.Show diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.Include your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.If you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.3. Brand YourselfOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-Whether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.Along with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.Your logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.Most importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.The domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.Become a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.4. Understand the project requirement carefullyAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.The only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.9. Be ProfessionalWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-Starting date of projectThe project’s deadlineMilestonesFunctionalitiesSchedule meeting in priorMake the clear timeline of deliverables.Professionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–Keep Your Personal Life limited to yourselfYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.  It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.Charge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.Schedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.If some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.Build the right association.It is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.Follow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.Don’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.Be positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.10. Networking and Relationship with ClientsBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..Some useful techniques to grow your network.1. Increase your Social Media Network  Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.  2. Attend events You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.3. Speak at events Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event. 4. Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at. 5. Connect at co-working space You can share your desk with other freelancers from another field; this is the best way to enrich knowledge and network.  All points listed above reinforces you to become a freelancer, your perfect profile generation for freelance success and helps you in becoming your own boss with a promising career ahead."
GRE,"Which is the best GRE Online Program: Magoosh, GRE Edge, Crack Verbal, Chalkstreet or Galvanize test prep?",https://www.quora.com//Which-is-the-best-GRE-Online-Program-Magoosh-GRE-Edge-Crack-Verbal-Chalkstreet-or-Galvanize-test-prep,"Crack Verbal, Galvanize Test Prep, Gre Edge, ChalkStreet, Magoosh, GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions",73,"Since I didn’t enroll with Magoosh or Crack Verbal or Chalkstreet or Galvanize, I can’t speak for them although I did use the Magoosh vocab app which was good and precise. But I can speak for GREedge as I was enrolled in one of their programs. The experience was definitely good as I recently took the GRE and scored 323 and 4 in AWA.When you enroll with GREedge, they give you two SFAs (Student Facilitator and Analysts) who work with you throughout the process. They constantly remind you of your goals for the week, things you have pending and other stuff. They give you an idea about what things to read to improve your comprehensive reading skills (which is pivotal in an exam like GRE) with respect to the GRE. In a nutshell, they are really helpful pushing you to be consistent.Their “Learning Tracker” is a good place where various tools are there for your disposal, like the “Ask a doubt” feature or different wordlists or the dictionary app which focuses on GRE words. Everything is neatly organised and the best part is you can work on it from anywhere anytime. They provide you a huge amount of material both in quant and in verbal and it is up to you to use it. Also, they tell you to set a target score in quant and in verbal and they provide you statistical data showing where you stand among the different students who have achieved the target score set by you. So, it gives you a fair idea regarding how much more effort you need to put subject wise and topic wise. Also, they frequently conduct seminars where different people talk about different techniques which can be implemented in different sections of the exam or about their experiences regarding GRE and MS in general. So, that helps too.The most striking feature of GREedge is their “Wordbot” app where they provide you a set of words with pictures describing their meanings. Now, you may not remember the meaning of a certain word, like “appalled” for instance, but you’ll certainly remember the appalled expression of Brad Pitt which is shown in the picture describing the word. My point is you can retain pictures more easily than words. And it helps, at least in my case it did. And not a single word in my GRE was outside the set of words in Wordbot.Overall, it was a rewarding experience for me. And lastly, it is always up to you to take maximum use of the resources of any program. I understand it becomes hard especially if you are working on a job, but it helped me. And, as someone has already said, it ultimately boils down to the amount of effort you make.So, all the best!","I Galvanize is a good option for GRE preparation.

GRE,What is the best way to improve your English vocabulary for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-the-best-way-to-improve-your-English-vocabulary-for-the-GRE,"Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Vocabulary of the English Language, English Grammar, Grammar, Exam and Test Preparation, English (language)",81,"If you want to crack verbal section of GRE you definitely need a huge vocabulary. Work on vocabulary is never a waste of time. It pays dividends in terms of your final GRE score.Do not just use one approach for mastering vocabulary, work in myriad ways.1. ReadingReading is the best way for improving vocabulary. For complete neophytes, The Hindu editorial is a best place to start. If you have more time read articles from nytimes, The Economist these are filled with challenging gre words. Even the Best American Science series books can help a lot.Make a flash card for each and every unknown word you have encountered.As I said earlier do not just use one way for improving your vocabulary.2. Mnemonics Mnemonics is also a very effective technique for boosting your arsenal of words. Try to make mnemonics for the words which are difficult and pesky. Make mnemonics in your mother tongue since they are much easier to get into your long term memory. Remember your mnemonics need not make any sense for others as long as they help you in building vocabulary. It might be a little difficult in the beginning to make mnemonics but trust me you will enjoy it when you get used to it and learning words will no longer be a cumbersome job rather it would be a fun.Examples of a few mnemonics I madePalliate – reduce pain.My mnemonic – [palli ate] If you eat pallis(groundnut in telugu) your pain would be reduced.Raconteur – A good Entertainer.Mnemonic – Rekha aunty wearing a red sari tells pleasurable stories in an amusing way.Flagrant- something considered wrong or bad.My Mnemonic – He is so bad because he gave the flag for rent.They are much better and even awesome if I told you in my native language.I can’t give you more examples because most of them are in Telugu and also they are also a bit salacious.3. Use The WordsThis is an awesome way which helps to retain the words you learnt and also fish for new words. Write a story using all the words you learned that day or if you are not good at story telling then write a journal using all the words. Like in flash cards, your story need not make any sense just try to connect all words.This is so effective because we can retain information much better when we do something with that information like using the words in sentences etc.4. Flash CardsThere are flash cards on the market that have high frequency words and their definitions, but to get a higher score you will need to know more than just definitions. So make flash cards on your own.I know this is a tedious exercise but it can help you to buttress your vocabulary studies.Here’s how to make GRE flash cards.1. Buy some empty paper business cards set.2. Write the word in CAPITAL LETTERS on one side of the card.3. On the back of card draw a line dividing the card into two parts.Page on 4 the first part write the different meanings of the word.5. Now in the second part write the sentence where you actually encountered the word. This is important because it helps more to remember the word if you make a note of actual sentence than writing some other sentence using the word. Of course, if you have additional space left you can do that.Ok, now you know how to prepare Flash Cards but How to use them?Here’s a couple of ways to make the most out of the flash cards.Pull out a small stack of cards. After you peruse all cards in the stack at least once then its time for elimination. Go through the stack one at a time quizzing yourself on each word – If you get it right, take it out of the stack and lay it aside. As, you continue the stack becomes smaller and smaller.If you are left with two or three difficult words and you are unable to remember, make mnemonics of those words, google those words for additional definitions, check out those words in Fun and easy way to build your vocabulary!.If you have to buy flash cards set then go for Manhattan and do fixed amount of flash cards per day no matter how tired or busy you are.I had kaplan flash cards,I did 20 cards on working days and 35 cards on holidays.Of course,the number of cards per day depends on you and the time you had for GRE.Grouping:After doing a good number of flash cards like 100 or more, you can group those flash cards based on different categories like words related to money ….. Thrifty, parsimonious, frugal, penurious, words related to time anachronistic etc.5. Audio TapesIf you have to spend a lot of time commuting or on other activities where you cannot use flash cards then audio tapes can come to your rescue. You can make your own audio files by reciting all the words, their meanings, example sentences and even mnemonics or can download some from internet.I made 20 audio tapes, half an hour each and they are very helpful during my early battle with the words.Why it is so important to read in context?Words shift connotation depending on the situation. A word in one context has a meaning entirely different from the same word in other context. A dictionary definition may be completely useless in this case. Also in new are the focus on obscure words has been eliminated. ETS wants to test you on the ability on how can you use the word than merely on memorizing the word.If you go through the wordlist by rote …… you are more likely to forget them. Also the habit of reading helps a lot in Reading comprehension of GRE.Remember “There are no shortcuts to success”.Success entails hard and smart work.An Additional Tip: Get enough sleep during your GRE preparation period. REM sleep plays an important role in encoding long term memory, and in an eight hour period of sleep, the last hour has the most REM. If you are getting 7 hours/night instead of 8 hours/night, you are depriving your brain of one of its most powerful systems for learning and remembering. Recommended online resources for VocabularyFollow Vocab Wednesdays in Magoosh GRE Blogquizlet.com – here you can make your own flash cards or study some existing ones.wordnik.com – returns sentences using the given word.mnemonicdictionary.com – filled with awesome mnemonics it can help you a lot in the initial stages of mnemonic makingDictionary.com – word of the dayRecommended Books For Vocab1.Magoosh Vocab e-book : This book is filled with about 300 confusing gre words explained with mnemonics and example sentences.2.Manhattan Flash cards (2 sets) – 500 Essential Words: GRE Vocabulary Flash Cards , 500 Advanced Words: GRE Vocabulary Flash Cards3.Essential Words for the GRE (Barron’s GRE)4.Word Smart, 5th Edition (Smart Guides)5.Build Your Vocabulary Skills!

If you have an year or more before you take the examination, start collecting words as you read articles or watch a TV Series. The trick is when Ross says “I am indignant as a consumer”, pause the show then and there, and look for the word (So the next time you see ‘indignant’ again, you will remember that condom works only for like 97% of the time :P). Collect all words you come across in a word file or notebook and use it actively whenever you get a chance.I found following sources quite ‘meaningful’:Vocabulary.com. It gives you a subjective and contextual definition. Exactly what’s required for GRE!Any website which gives you meaning in your native language: Finding a direct substitute for word of your native language will help you use it more actively and frequentlymnemonicdictionary.com: It offers some tricks which makes you learn words in an easier wayWhen GRE is not more than 3 pages away on your calendar, shift to actively devouring vocabulary.Find right words: You don’t need to learn all the 3000–4000 recommended GRE words. The primary goal is to know most of the words which has been categorized as Basic or Intermediate word in any study material. I used GRE vocabulary app by Magoosh, Barron’s 1100 words and Major Test(only the basic words). Moreover, and what most people ignore, do learn all the words that you come across while practicing questions. For instance,So, even if you know the answer is hoi-polloi, parochial & facile, learn the meaning of all unknown words as they are likely to lie under the ‘GRE vocabulary range’ (specially if you are preparing with recommended materials.)Make a story: Keep collecting all the words in a Word file or a notebook so that you can keep a track. To remember a word for a longer time, making a story(just a paragraph)out of every 25–30 words can be very helpful. It might appear as waste of time, but after a month, reading just the paragraph will remind you of all the words. For example, I made thisYou don’t need to think of the sentences which perfectly fit the words or make sense out of the story. The goal is to use the word for once and it will effortlessly stay in our mind.‘Cheat codes’ for words: As there are so many words to learn in a small time, it’s better to note down in such a way that might be funny and memorable and you could decipher the meaning just by reading it. For instance, I used to write words like:If you can come up with your own such trick, it’s much easier to remember or otherwise you could find it on www.mnemonicdictionary.com or dailyvocab.com.In essence, what appears to be a humongous task can be tackled smartly. While preparing for GRE, practice a lot of questions. The vocabulary will no longer be an explicit concern and you will learn it in the process of solving questions.","1. ReadWhen reading, we don’t expect to see a given word.  This element of surprise makes reading a more effective vocabulary-learning tool compared to flashcards and memorization.  Also, the revised GRE focuses on vocabulary in context - again, making reading more effective.  The New Yorker, Atlantic Monthly, and Economists are littered with GRE words and are great ways to improve vocabulary and reading comprehension.  2. Use words activelyOnce you’ve exposed yourself to new words through reading, you should use active usage to embed the words into long-term memory.  Creativity is the key to active usage.  As words pop into your head, think of where you can use them.  Indeed, the zanier the connections you make with words, the more likely you are to remember them.3. Use mnemonicsLet's say you are trying to remember the definition of lambaste (to reprimand harshly).   Now, imagine you are cooking. You’re not very adept in the kitchen, but you want to surprise your significant other with his/her favorite dish. Well, in the end, you end up ruining the lamb. Your significant other arrives and, witnessing your culinary debacle, gives you a good going over, “you don’t baste a lamb, you roast one.”As silly as my mnemonics may sound, the main takeaway is that a good mnemonic is the one that works for you. And by good, I mean it is memorable. For instance, you may have already forgotten my lambaste mnemonics, because you didn’t think of them yourself. But, if you are struggling with a word, a clever mnemonic will not only make the word easier to learn but will also — hopefully — make the word more fun to learn.We have an article with additional tips on learning vocab along with a plethora or resources available here: http://magoosh.com/gre/gre-vocab...Update: We released a new, free flashcard app with 1,000 of the most common GRE words: Free GRE Flashcards - Magoosh GRE","As we all must be familiar with that GRE consists of mainly 2 sections i.e. Quantitative and Verbal section and both these sections are equally important in order to land our dream GRE score and university.   1. Quantitative section deals with basic and general mathematics that we were taught in high school and it requires a strong conceptual knowledge in the subject   2. The verbal section involves grammar, reading comprehensions and vocabulary knowledge. Verbal section is very important for students applying for grants and fellowship in order to get funding for their education abroad. A high verbal score provides the university with a sense that yes the candidate has a decent command over the language and can be a useful resource to a professor and hence might get you a fellowship.  So, How to prepare for the verbal section? Generally people think that learning 1000’s of words and just mugging up antonyms and synonyms is the way to go, but the correct way is completely opposite of that. We have to decide between smart work and hard work. Of course smart hard work is the way to go.   For better enhanced vocabulary we must learn the roots of words and get to know how these words come to origin , this involves learning something between 300-500 roots of words and that is it. Once we are done with learning these roots we can easily learn more than 100 words per hour by simply breaking down the words into part and learning them. Now just learning these words and roots won’t lead us anywhere, the questions asked in our GRE tests are generally application based and we must learn the usage of these words in the most effective and efficient manner. To achieve this all we can do is read read and read.   Steps to learn new words in effective manner 1. Pickup reading material that excites you let it be newspaper, books, novels or whatever.  2. Mark the words that you find foreign and jot them down. 3. Try to identify the roots of the words. 4. Later try to find the meaning of these words on your own in terms of the context you read  and literal meaning in dictionary.  Many books are available in the market for this very purpose but I would recommend you buying the book: “Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis”. This book provides passages as well as roots of words that will help you ace the GRE verbal section and master you vocabulary.   Thanks to internet and smart phones now you can download an app on your device that will fulfill your purpose of better vocabulary in the most effective manner. You can access the app on a go and will help you wherever you are and whatever small time you have. The name of the app is VoLT (Vocabulary Learning techniques) and it is made by IIT and IIM alumni, the app has many great features that will help you. Some of them are,   1.Pictorial representation of the word ( In the sense it can be used ) explained correct meaning 2.Provision of synonym and antonyms of every word, its usage in sentence , pronunciation of the word in both verbal track and written (break down of the word) .  3. The app has numerous words which can be learnt and are used in our day to day lives.  4. If you are going to give your GRE exam in 2-3 months then this app is bible for you, as in less time you will be able to learn the most probable words that could be asked in you examAN EXAMPLE OF HOW VOLT IS USEFULThe App provides with pictures that represent the word. Visual representation leaves maximum impression on our brain and hence makes it very easy to learn new words .  But the best usage of VoLT can only be taken if you practice the words regularly in your daily life and apply them as much as you can.

GRE,What is the key to scoring more than 160 points on the verbal section of the new GRE?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-the-key-to-scoring-more-than-160-points-on-the-verbal-section-of-the-new-GRE,"Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Exams and Tests",22,"I gave the GRE in August 2013 and scored 335 (Q: 170, V: 165) . This is what worked for me : 1. Reading the newspaper daily : This is a must. I used to read the entire thing, even the news that didn't interest me at all. I underlined all the words I didn't know and later wrote them down in a diary with a sentence example to remember how they're used. Reading the paper is also good practice for the comprehension section, it helps in increasing your 'flow' .2. Reading a lot in general :   Try reading books of genres you don't particularly like. I , for example, read some of the classics which bored me to death but eventually helped a great deal with the comprehensions. Some GRE comprehensions can be really dull and you need to develop the sense to read things you're not interested in.3. Cramming a high frequency wordlist    Buy some practice modules like Barron's and try cramming at least 30-40 words a day. And DON'T do this orally. Write everything down. Revise the words you learnt yesterday before  starting with today's words. And at the end of the week, revise all the words you crammed that week. You're bound to forget no matter how much time you spend on learning them. Use some tricks to remember the words. It can be frustrating but don't get disheartened. There are always some words which no matter what you do, you just can't memorize. Make a separate list of these words and religiously 'worship' them everyday.You can also learn some root words like 'cog', which is related to the brain. So COGnizance is knowledge and to COGitate is to think. This'll help you surmise the meaning of words you don't know directly. 4. Most of all, PRACTICE Lots and lots of practice is needed if you really want a good score. Make sure you have plenty of practice material. You can find some free material online as well. Don't forget to TIME YOURSELF. This is very, very important. If the verbal section is of 25 minutes duration , you should set the timer to 20 minutes. You might not be able to complete the section within this duration in the beginning, but trust me, eventually you will. Train your brain to work under pressure. That's all the advice I can give. This won't be easy and you'll have your moments of frustration, but you have to keep pushing yourself out of your comfort zone if you really want to achieve something.","Thanks for asking me to answer! :) I will tell you what I feel is the key to get 160+ in verbal section. Some of my friends have also followed this, and most of them have got 160+ so, I think there must be something right about this.You need to do improve the following skills, depending on the time you have left. (See my answer to Is three months sufficient to prepare for the GRE?)Vocabulary :You need not learn thousands of words, but good vocabulary always translates into a good score. Learn the most frequent words (Barrons 333, Kaplans 400..) and then make yourself familiar with the jargon in NYTimes, Washington Post etc.,Use it or Lose it. You can improve the vocabulary only by using them. Reading Comprehension Skills :Practice a lot. This will be significantly helpful for your graduate study as well. Use online MSTs as well as sites like RC Practice Utility By Lagnajeet Pradhan. I found the book Manhattan Reading Comprehension succinct and helpful. You should look at that at least once.Sentence Equivalence and Text Completion SkillsThe key to score more in SE and TC is smart guesswork and reasoning. Guess the meaning (if you don't know it), guess the answer , see if your guess is in the options available and reason out why the other options are wrong. Another key is to follow specific strategies (to save time). Manhattan SE and TC should be really helpfulActually the key to score more than 160 in vocab, is to keep calm and be confident. Don't add too much weight to the score. Just enjoy the process and practise a lot before you take the actual GRE.All the best! :)","How to Achieve more than 160 on the Verbal section (Quora)  Getting above 160 on the GRE verbal is going to be very challenging, especially if you’ve never been much of a reading person. That doesn’t mean such an increase is impossible. Indeed, I’ve seen quite a few students go from the lower 150’s to well over 160 (and a few who’ve gotten there after starting off at a sub-150).  In each instance, the person has displayed laser-like focus and remarkable resilience. Yet those traits alone will not help you crack the 160 mark. You’ll need to keep the following in mind:  1.   Understand how vocabulary works in context The GRE verbal is mainly about vocabulary. Even the RC section often relies on your ability to know a vocabulary word (words such as perfunctoriness have show up in answer choices). At the same time, simply knowing the rote definition of a word isn’t going to get you very far.  Instead you must learn how words function in context. A great way to do this is by looking up example sentences online. For instance, let’s say your flashcard defines perfunctory as performed merely as a typical duty; superficial. You can ingrain that definition into your head and still be totally flustered if perfunctory shows up as one of the answers in a Text Completion. That’s because you really aren’t equipped—by that definition alone—to know if perfunctory fits on the blank.  On the other hand, if you go to Wordnikand read several example sentences, or use flashcards with well-thought out example sentences (Manhattan GRE (MGRE) and Magoosh, come to mind), then you are far more likely to get a grasp of how to use perfunctory in a sentence. (I should mention that I work for Magoosh!).  And that’s the key to success on the GRE verbal: knowing not just the denotative (dictionary/flashcard definition) but also the connotative definition (the ways—both figurative and literal—that a word can function in a scholarly context).   2.   Read voraciously, and outside of your comfort zone Your reading brain is a muscle. If it has been out of use—or you’ve mainly been reading your friends’ tweets or FB updates—then that muscle has most likely atrophied. Doing dull and dry GRE reading passages will definitely snap it back into shape. However, you want to exercise that muscle throughout the day, and doing only GRE reading passages will try even the doughtiest person’s sanity. The New Yorker and The New York Timesare great places to start.  If you need something even more challenging, I highly recommend Arts & Letters Daily, which will definitely take you out of your comfort zone. The articles are scholarly, dense, and challenging. And remember—whenever you encounter words you don’t know, look those words up and try to get a better sense of how they function in context.    3.   Use material that is as difficult or more difficult than what you’ll see test day There are quite a few test prep companies out there with material that is much easier than what you’ll see on the actual GRE. Unless you are just starting to prep, doing such passages won’t help much. And if you are going for the 160+, then they may very well hurt you.  Instead, use prep material that is as difficult, if not more difficult than what you’ll see test day. The LSAT guides, for one, are great troves of formidably opaque and ridiculously recondite reading passages. Manhattan GRE prep's  online tests contain Text Completions and Sentence Equivalence questions with very twisted sentence structure. Some of the Magoosh TC’s (according to our customers, at least) are harder than what you’ll see test day.    4.   Build up your stamina You may be able to whip through a tough passage and a set of daunting Text Completions with no problem. Yet those very questions that you breezed through will seem a lot more difficult when you are sitting in the testing center after three straight hours of GRE.  Make sure you do plenty of mock tests (math included!) to build up your stamina.   Finally, as I mentioned in the beginning, you need focus and perseverance. Learning all these words is like learning an entirely new language. But by following the above, you can break into the rarefied realm of the 160+ GRE verbal score.","You'd be able to get that score in verbal if you are into reading , maybe right from your childhood. This was what helped me when I took my GRE last year. However, if you don't really like reading, you might have to work hard for a few months at least to get a feel of the type of questions they ask on the GRE.  You need to work simultaneously on vocabulary and reading comprehension. Your goal should be to minimize the time you need to solve the sentence  completion and text completion questions, thereby maximizing the time available for reading comprehension. Reading comprehension is where you'll be really tested, even if you think you have a great command over English. Use the Barron's word list. Don't try to mindlessly cram words everyday. This might just help you on the exam but not in the long run. I used to pick up the list when I was free and I never got bored reading about words. Try to pick out roots from the words as you go along. For example ' mem' ( Memory, memoir, memento, memorial, memorandum etc.) Imagine situations where you'd use the words and create sentences in your head using the word you learnt. Create strong associations with words. Associate the words' meanings with familiar entities. If you can't remember what a 'pugilist' is, try remembering that ' Million Dollar Baby' was about a pugilist. Images worked for me , so you can try to associate vivid, familiar images with words that are hard to remember. Use flash cards. Try to read about how a word came into being just the way it is. I would recommend Norman Lewis's Word Power Made Easy. Although I didn't read it completely, it was what made my learning about words experience funny and enjoyable.  An important advice for all verbal questions is : Exploit the context. You'd not be asked a word's meaning on the GRE without being given a context for that word. You can try to find out the tone of the sentence surrounding a difficult word and then at least partially guess the meaning of the word. I cannot stress on this enough: Practice. RCs can be nightmare if you are not prepared for them. The more difficult ones that I had on my GRE had a peculiar quality to them. The meaning and the conclusions were very elusive and I was frequently tempted to change my answers. I had to read the passages once, twice, thrice to understand the nuances. I had solved a large number of passages during my preparation but still I thought more would've helped. Try to solve many, many passages. Finally, don't forget to take the two official GRE practice tests that come with the CD. Your score in them will most likely reflect the score you'd be getting on the real test. I scored 330 and 332 on those tests and my actual GRE score turned out to be 334.    *I will update this answer soon adding more details to it*"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5.

GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy !

GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software).

Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It's ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!You could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your termsKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms","It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.You’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.You’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.You have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it. You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door. But, remember ‘freelancing job is also an actual job’. There’s nothing fancy about it until you make it.Before you are a freelancer you should prepare for being one. These is a simple road-map which you need to follow with determination, to make through this challenge.ACQUIRING SKILLS:This is the most important part. You need to acquire skills in whatever field you choose. You may find this boring and have an urge to jump over and look up to the offers. You may have misconceptions of having all necessary skills. But, this is the only way you can be successful in long run.Take a break to start an elaborated research in the chosen field and the specializations they demand.Look out for dummy projects to build a great portfolio. Offer to work with your peers, friends and nonprofit organizations for free.Keep a close look at people already in the industry and look up to their work. Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.MANAGING NETWORKSLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.Now that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.BEING THE BRANDThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.You need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help. Get your business cards and be ready to talk about the work you do and yourself more often.Learn some basic marketing and accounting skills. Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.THE ADVENTURE RIDENow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!Start looking out for jobs. This might be a slow-moving process, instead of getting stressed introspect your offers.At first work on project/job expecting limited or no money at all. This is to just make connection sharpening your skills and showcasing your talent. These resources might be helpful to start off: Upwork, Guru, Elance, PeoplePerHour, Freelancer, Craig list;Once you have built a quality portfolio and demonstrated your work it’s time to hunt big offers. Serve the clients with generosity, build a rapport. Businesses will start taking you seriously about your specialization.Your career will see a boost. In the long run, you can either be choosy about your project or take projects in volumes, both are keys to success. With time, you’ll be able to create a Brand which clients and businesses will look up to.Finally, keep up the good work and regularly meet other freelancers, talk them about your business. Use calling more often than emailing to a client. These things will give your brand a personal touch and also avoid the feeling of isolation. Now, you are independent and can set your own working ethics being selective about projects and jobs. The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.This answer is a part of my blog, read it here.If you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.Please do let me know your suggestions and feedback.I’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.","For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.That doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.But I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.For example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”To that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.Of course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.Here are a few:You learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.There are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.It’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.You get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?Freelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.Bottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.And you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.If you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.On the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.Once you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.","Let’s start step by step:1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.If you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:Freelancer - Hire & Find JobsUpworkCraigslistPeoplePerHour99designsGuruEngineerBabuHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.2. Build a Perfect websiteAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.While building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.Show diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.Include your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.If you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.3. Brand YourselfOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-Whether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.Along with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.Your logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.Most importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.The domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.Become a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.4. Understand the project requirement carefullyAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.The only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.9. Be ProfessionalWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-Starting date of projectThe project’s deadlineMilestonesFunctionalitiesSchedule meeting in priorMake the clear timeline of deliverables.Professionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–Keep Your Personal Life limited to yourselfYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.  It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.Charge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.Schedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.If some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.Build the right association.It is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.Follow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.Don’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.Be positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.10. Networking and Relationship with ClientsBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..Some useful techniques to grow your network.1. Increase your Social Media Network  Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.  2. Attend events You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.3. Speak at events Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event. 4. Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at. 5. Connect at co-working space You can share your desk with other freelancers from another field; this is the best way to enrich knowledge and network.  All points listed above reinforces you to become a freelancer, your perfect profile generation for freelance success and helps you in becoming your own boss with a promising career ahead."
GRE,How do I get 330 in the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-get-330-in-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Exam Strategies",32,"GRE is not a test of your intelligence. It's more about how well you are able to hack the exam pattern and temperament.To go from 320 or 325 to 330/330+ makes all the difference and every point needs to be earned.Verbal: Assuming most people appearing for GRE from India are engineers or atleast from STEM background, Verbal gives nightmares to everyone. Blame it on our schools who taught us to mug up answers in English.Vocab: Don't be lazy about Vocab! It pays rich dividends. Good vocab prep means Sentence Equivalence and Text Completions part done so 8/20 questions taken care of. It helps tremendously in improving AWA quality, understanding RCs and TOEFL writing too. Start slowly and build up from there. Start with 333 High frequency word list, then move on to 800 word list, then 2000 and so on. 10 days prior to GRE focus on 800 word list. It helps the most. (If you are preparing for GRE under severe time constraints, Barron’s800 word list is your saviour). 90% of words on my GRE were from list and I was able to solve all questions by process of elimination because I knew all options or all but one in worst case scenario. There are several apps& websites available like : Magoosh Flashcards, Quizlet, Memrise etc. They have different formats. Pick what suits you the best. My personal favourite was Memrise because reviewing words already learnt is as important if not more as compared to learning new words. Set short targets such learning 20 new words.Reading Comprehensions: pace yourself well while reading. First reading should be mostly skimming through the text. If you don't understand something don't fret. You don't need to understand the whole passage to crack it. Don't trust instincts/gut feeling/memory either. Read every option and verify with relevant parts of passage. (Paraphrasing may help if you are really quick at reading). GRE tries to trick you by twisting/omitting/adding usually a word in the options which isn't in the passage. Thumbrule: eliminate any negative/out of context/ controversial options. More the practice and mock tests, better will be your RCs part.Quant:Manhattan 5 pound is a great book to start off and tackle questions of varying difficulty. Note: Don't skip Advance Quant part. Due to adaptive nature of tests you may get difficult questions in 2nd quant so it's a good idea to get used to it.How to avoid silly mistakes? By accepting them. Whenever I made a mistake in a mock test, instead of classifying under the broad banner of silly mistakes, I would write it down. Example “I calculated % instead of %change” etc.Utilise all 35 mins. Recheck every answer, using substitution or something. It really helps to eliminate silly mistakes.AWA: Usually we just have to clear a cut off for AWA.Read sample essays initially.Practice writing under timed conditions so you know how to manage those 30 mins.Leave 4–5 mins at end for proofreading twice. We tend to ignore spelling mistakes during first reading.General:Practice a lot of mocks with timed conditions so you are accustomed to various exam formats (number and sequence of verbal and quant sections)Keep a track of progress and keep reviewing mistakes.GRE is a test of temperament. Practice sitting in a chair in front of a computer and keeping your brain in full concentration mode for 4 hours at a stretch!Cheers! All the best!","The BasicsFirst off, let me assume you haven't completed an Engineering degree in a First-World Anglophone country, because a lot of my advice probably wouldn't apply to you then. I also don't think you'd have any problems scoring 330 as easy as pie because of the way you've been educated, so this post won't apply to you then. If you haven't however, a score of 330+ on the GRE signifies one of two things: You're either exceptionally well-rounded in both the Verbal and the Quantitative aspects of your education, meaning you won't lose more than 10 points aggregate in all your sections combined. There's a few people I know who're this way despite their Third-World upbringing. Hats off to them.Or, as I was, you're talented enough to score 170/170 on only one of your sections, and you've prepared well enough and done what's required on test-day not to lose more than 10 points on your other section. This was me. I knew I would get 169-170 on my Quants all along, it was all about damage limitation on GRE Verbal (which I wasn't very good at) and making sure I didn't squander more than ten points on test day. I succeeded, but not without some serious doubts along the way.So the objective is clear. You've got to avoid losing more than 10 points on test-day, Verbal and Quants combined. Let me talk about how I managed to accomplish that feat and how you can do the same.GRE VerbalFor me, Verbal was far and away the most difficult of all three GRE Sections, simply because of the limitations in my vocabulary and the types of questions that I encountered when I practiced for the GRE. If you're in the same boat, you'll fully understand how preparing for GRE Verbal can sometimes fill you with doubt and depression, because you've simply got no idea about what the right answer choice could be. The way I see it, the most crucial aspect to mastering GRE Verbal is not how much time you spend preparing. It hasn't even got much to do with how many words you know.The most crucial skill on GRE Verbal is Context.What does that mean? Basically, you need to know how the different words in English you're already familiar with can be used in differing contexts to provide alternate meanings. This is how you should inculcate context into your GRE Preparation:First things first. Buy a complete prep book for GRE Verbal. I chose Kaplan GRE Premier, but only because that was the book somebody else recommended to me. Barron's and ETS are more than good enough as well.Go through all the question types, tips and practice questions provided in at least one of these books. Doing so will ingrain the format of the question paper and the probable words you're likely to come across on the day of the test itself. If you make a mistake in answering a question, write that down in a separate booklet, understand why you made that mistake (unknown word, wrong context etc.) and make sure it doesn't happen again.I would also recommend going through all the resources available on the Magoosh website (https://gre.magoosh.com/) as well as the apps they've got for GRE Verbal, available for smartphones. They really helped brush up my vocabulary.I've also covered GRE Verbal Preparation in more detail here:What can I do to improve my verbal score in the GRE from 153 to 160+?GRE QuantsI didn't need to spend a lot of time preparing for the Quantitative Section of the GRE, partly because it was just 10th Grade Math, and partly because I knew I had more pressing issues to deal with a.k.a Verbal. But if you feel like you need to do better in Quant, there's really no substitute for practice. The books that I've mentioned previously have all got chapters devoted to GRE Quants as well, so getting questions to practice with shouldn't be a problem. Work on the mathematical concepts that you'll need for the test, improve your time management skills, and you'll be fine.Analytical WritingAgain, AWA wasn't especially relevant to my GRE Preparation since I'm going to be applying for an MS in an Engineering discipline, so anything above 4.0/6.0 was fine by me. There are two kinds of essays you'll have to write on test-day, 30 minutes each, with slightly different writing styles. The best way to improve your essay writing skills is to read the sample essays that're given in your prep books, and practice using similar words when you write your own pieces. This goes without saying, but please make sure your essays are devoid of any grammatical/spelling mistakes, as those kinds of errors tend to be looked upon very poorly. Lastly, here's an here's an extensive guide written by the lads over at CrunchPrep on scoring 330+ on your GRE.Hope this helps :)","Here’s how I scored 330+ with a 3 week preparation plan!It is important to understand that the GRE is very different as compared to the other exams we are used to giving, talking from an Indian’s perspective. Blind hard work will not serve any purpose and sometimes will be counterproductive.ETS (the company that conducts the GRE) wants to convince you that your score is a measure of how good you are at ‘critical thinking’, but in reality it is only a measure of how good you are at giving the GRE. So, fortunately for us, the more you practise in the correct way, the better you become at giving the GRE.The Correct Way (in my experience) :Quality > Quantity. Always. Please do not spend 10+ hours a day mechanically solving problems and forgetting about them as you move forward. This will cause you to plateau at a certain skill level. The key is small incremental improvements.For me, the ideal way was a simple 3 step process :1.	Solve problems in small sets, around 20(+5 || -5) questions per set.2.	Check your answers. See the solutions, understand them thoroughly.3.	After checking all, recap the questions you got wrong, why, and what you learnt from them. This is extremely important.Let’s jump into the schedule now, shall we?Pre-prep phase (1 week) :Okay, I lied, it’s not really 3 weeks, but this pre-prep phase won’t take more than two hours of your time per day, and what’s more, you can easily do this while you eat or just before sleeping.What is to be done? Words, Words and more Words.Spend this week learning the words from the following apps :1.	Barron’s 11002.	Magoosh Flash Cards (around 1000 words)3.	Manhattan Essential Words (around 500 words)Vocabulary is essential to understanding the Reading Comprehensions as well as the sentence completions, so please complete this before moving ahead!Week 1 :Congratulations! The boring part is done. This week, let’s do :1.	4 Practice Tests2.	Practise each type of question in isolation. For example, do 20 Text Completions in one set. This will help you to identify weaknesses to work on.3.	Brush up all the shortcuts and maths formulae that you encounter.(Online Magoosh article exists)Week 2 :This week, let’s move forward with :1.	6 Practice Tests.2.	Do mixed practice sets now (All types of problems together), to simulate the actual GRE scenario.3.	Strictly time your tests and practice sets. Keep 5 minutes per section as a buffer. Identify which type of questions you are slow at. Work on them.Week 3 :Buckle up, this is your final lap :1.	8 practice tests.2.	Start reading AWA essays online, as well as general structuring tips. A lot of video material is available online. Practise a few essays if necessary.3.	Revise the Vocabulary words and mathematical formulae.At the end of this schedule, you should be ready to face the GRE. So be confident, sleep well before the paper and ohh, don’t forget to carry a jacket. It’s freezing in there.Thanks for reading!

GRE,Is it right time to give GRE and pursue MS?,https://www.quora.com//Is-it-right-time-to-give-GRE-and-pursue-MS,"Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Career Advice",5,"Hi,A2A. When I am reading your situation it almost felt like someone is explaining my own situation to me. Even I graduated in 2014 from an NIT (ECE dept.). As I had a pretty good pointer and an interesting profile, I got placed in an IT organization when I was in my seventh semester. I wasn't sure of what I wanted to do further. I definitely had plans, but I wasn't sure. Research is my passion. So, I wanted to continue my education and explore more. As I am not sure of what exactly I wanted, I took up the job thinking I could plan things when I am working and also I can earn some good money which could be useful when I study. Also, I was in boarding school since my childhood. I thought taking a break could help me spend more quality time with my family. So, I finally I took the job. I don't like IT jobs right from the start but still because of the above said reasons, I had started working. Initially, as it was my first professional job I was pretty excited about it. The training period of 45 days at the start was fun as I attended training along with couple of my classmates and students from other NITs and IITs. Then we were assigned to our departments and I was put up in a team where no single person in the whole team is of my age or atleast closer. All of them are roughly minimum 15 years elder to me and moreover I was the only girl in the team. I had a hard time to adjust. I thought it's okay to have initial hiccups. I worked so efficiently that I used to get compliments from the Vice president of the vertical. Also, I had a very good manager. Simultaneously, I joined GRE classes as I was planning for MS. Slowly, two months passed and the work became so monotonous and boring. My manager had gone onsite and my GRE exam date approached. By then I became an important resource in the eyes of VP. As my manager wasn't there I wasn't sure whom to ask leave for. So, I left a message to my manager and took a leave for 7 days. By the time I came to back to office, the whole opinion on me changed because I took a leave without higher authorization, though I managed to cover all the work within the deadline. I was assigned to a manager who is a selfish jerk and a donkey. I never respected him as a person because he doesn't even have a character but I was confident over myself as I always stayed perfect with my work. I became the worst employee for taking leave and not respecting manager. To teach me a lesson, I was sent to a remote place in the name of ""ONSITE"" despite working efficiently. The loneliness I had suffered there is beyond explanation.  I am away from my friends, working in an extremely unfriendly environment on a work that I no longer had interest. I was so lost during that time that I missed most of the college admission deadlines, which is my prior importance in life. I was supposed to go for M.S. by this august but because I didn't apply to many universities by missing deadlines and universities I got though are very good but extremely cost, I could take up masters this year. To sum up, my IT life experience has given me nothing good. My main plan of pursuing MS by 2015 itself got postponed. I didn't even save much as I have planned earlier. I had to work on many Saturdays so my plan of spending time with family also didn't work. As I was sitting for nearly 10 hours a day infront of a computer eating hostel food at irregular times, all my health got spoiled. I had to take orders from a donkey who takes up advantage of his position. Felt bad everyday that all my talent is going waste by doing some monotonous job. I got judged by people in their 40s and 50s because of my straight forwardness and DRESSING! Ultimately, suffered mentally a lot and lost inner peace. All this happened because I took a job which I had no interest in. May be, if I had interest in the IT job, I wouldn't have seen all of these as problems. Now, I left the job and I am working in an IIT as project assistant, doing research and I stay at home spending good time with family. Though I get paid very less when compared to my previous salary, I am totally okay with it. Now, I have time for myself and my interests. I decided to work here until I go for M.S. as I don't regret at any point now. Ultimately, we all are in PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS. Everything happens for a reason. The IT job helped me realize what exactly is that I want to do with my life. So I would suggest you to follow your dream. Take up SSB once again as you were very close this time. Try to make yourself perfect for the job you dream of. I have a friend who has made it to Air force in his third attempt. If you want to and have a reason to continue your education, then go for higher studies. It's never late to make your dreams come true. As you are a good orator and manager, try looking for jobs at functional level rather than technical. FOLLOW YOUR PASSION. That is all I got to say you. All the best!","Spend the extra year and take the GRE. Here are the reasons why you should not come to Germany1. It is a hard language to master. Even if you do, the preference in most jobs are for native speakers, and Germans don t consider anyone outside a narrow spectrum as native speaking. I had a perfect score in my TOEFL and yet I cannot get a job teaching English as I am not a ""native"" speaker.2. All that Mr. Anand says is true. What is missing is that Germany prefers to recruit these 100,000 engineers from within Germany and within the EU and many students spend their job search visa time running from pillar to post. Of course if you are lucky you can make it into one of the big multinationals that recruit foreigners or find a job in a start up. However if you don t you ll have to apply to small and medium sized companies that won t take you, no matter how perfect your German is.  Becoming perfect in German is a very hard task.3. The United States has a huge job market and is much more open to immigration. After all it s an immigrant country. Germany is not.So please unless you want to replicate your awful experience with the Air Force go to a country that will not connect your residence with your ability to get a job later.If on the other hand you would love to return to India then come here and study German. German companies love locals who have been to Germany and have decided to return.",Why always MS? Why can't you prepare for GATE and get into an IIT and do your masters from IIT only. More over the amount you will end up spending there is very much and without any benefit where as if you join an IIT you can a stipend of around 18000rs. If you do your MS you will end up spending 25lakhs on yours studies and also end up doing some job in a cafeteria for your livelihood. Instead of that you can take admission in IIT get a stipend and get enjoy your life studying properly. Also if you are in any part of India you can visit your hometown very easily compared to going abroad and coming once in a 2 year.,"So let me answer your question step by step,1.Your percentage in college of undergrad is quite low but at the same time your work experience in TCS is something to see upon and I might have different opinion if you dont have a job in middle or top level of management. If you dont want to work in IT and hate engineering then what exactly are you going to master in? That is something you need to up and discuss with a career counselor. PS: No matter what you see on the internet, please crosscheck everything with a good career counselor and with your family of course.2. Your application being accepted in Indian Air force is also something that is quite impressive and being rejected in physical test is not something that US universities will mind much about and can be easily sorted out in the SOP .3.Your good leadership skills can not be taken by the word of mouth and needs to be converted into the section of projects undertaken and projects lead section of your resume/cv .No university is going to believe in your qualities unless they see evidence of it in your CV, so that is something you need to work on.As per you visa issues, let me tell you that its the biggest myth I have seen regarding admissions in US, the whole visa process is a minute long interview with a person who wants to help you with your visa and all you need to be is honest with him. Dont involve any agency companies in your process that will make it messier.4. Now, what should you do? In my opinion since you are not interested in IT and engineering I would suggest you to give the GMAT exam, make sure you work on your profile very hard and with all your heart and leave no stone unturned, I will list some of the must have credentials in your CV while applying in these universities,1. A good CGPA or percentage in your Undergraduate:2. High GMAT score.3. High TOEFL score. A TOEFL score of 100+ is considered very decent, and can easily get you into a top 20 college in the US. Your TOEFL score might also get you fellowship and scholarship.  4. Internship/Job Experience.  5. Recommendation letter and Statement of purpose: These are only viewed by the college you applied in once you have impressed them by your CV and academics.   Many people tend to copy their SOP or get it written by someone else. It is very important to understand that all top universities have their interview rounds and they might ask you about your SOP, and it is better to write your SOP on your own rather than getting embarrassed in front of your professors. Writing your SOP is really easy, all you need to do is tell them why you want to join a particular university, trust me the more truthful you are the better it reflects to them.  Moving onto the Letter of recommendation part, this is more like a certification from your seniors (At Workplace), Professors from your regular college and Professors from any summer/winter school you attended. I wouldn’t go into detail for this section as it is really easy to get a letter of recommendation in countries like India etc.  Apart from the qualities mention above there are many more qualities you must have (But are secondary) in order to land your dream college. Some of those qualifications are, 1. Sports participation in inter college competition  2. Certification from a reputed institution in a musical instrument or vocals. etcMake sure to check out our app VOLT on Google play store.

GRE,How should I prepare for the AWA section of the revised GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-prepare-for-the-AWA-section-of-the-revised-GRE,"GRE Analytical Writing, Standardized Tests, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions",10,"I scored a 5.0Don't follow the structure! Yes, I said it. Err. I mean, forget the structure which people think GRE evaluators give credit to. If you are considerably good in English, you don't need preparation for AWA. But if you are not confident enough, it's better to do ample amount of preps. During my GRE preparations, I did keep a day every week at the least to AWA. (for about four weeks) This day would consist of:1. Write about anything -  this opens up your mind (if you are in a busy schedule). No rules, no theme! Initially, I found this activity to be distressing, because I would find it prohibiting. Why? I tend to do well when the activity has a specific direction. But by doing this activity, I was preparing for unexpected.  I realized this, though only after I wrote GRE, when I introspected my AWA preparation and waited for my scores hoping for the best.2. Write one Issue and one Argument Essay: Open the list of GRE AWA topics, randomly select one each in both the sections, fix a time of (30+30) for practice. My tip: Close the door, keep the room silent, keep a timer of 30 minutes, finish one section, keep the section's answer aside, reset the timer and continue. Don't think about your previous section 3. Analyse your writing: The GRE AWA list of topics usually have sample answers or important notes that help you evaluate your answer. Be fair while evaluating yourself - neither the liberal side nor the harsh side of evaluation. Look for common grammatical errors. Then look at your sentence structures and paragraph structures. This looks complicated, but as you write more, you feel this is just too natural. It's important for you to realize which structure of an answer to issue/argument you are comfortable with. Hence, write more, think how you are organizing your thoughts in the essay - may be keep one paragraph each for one  main point (like reasons for sth, arguments as to not implement sth etc.)ETS gives sample answers, based on which you can give a score to your answer, which you think is fair. 4. Read everything- you can see how people write, so that you can improve your writing as well. Read pro-actively, because you begin to see new words. (do not keep a dictionary with you while doing this. try to interpret the meaning of the word in the context - and possibly a way to remember the word again. )You say you are not able to give your idea the worth of more than three sentences. This can be solved. Illustrate, give an example, elaborate. If you can't find a real-world example, make a hypothesis. Really, people say in AWA, your real world examples carry weight! Bullshit! I had zero real world examples. Elaborating on your hypothesis allows your essay to be strong; it showcases your strength in evaluating both depth and breadth of your stand in the issue/argument.Lastly, keep track of those beautiful sentences that you wrote in your sample essays. On the day before your GRE, you can have a look at what you wrote, so that your preparation is complete. More importantly, look at this task as fun, not as a draconian task.","Okay, first of all, I think I can answer this question as I wrote my GRE very recently, and I got a 5 on 6.( don't ask how it happened, I was in the zone :P) I have usually noticed that people tend to exaggerate the difficulty of the AWA section. Now, I admit that it is not easy to whip up a smooth, eloquent essay on the spot within a short span of 30 mins, but it is not as ""draconian"" as you seem to perceive. If there's one piece of advice I would give you, it is that, make sure you write at least 10 essays before facing the test. The topics may not repeat, but it will give you the confidence required to write an impressive essay. Having said that, it is important to structure your points. All of us have our own methods. What I generally do is to spend a minute trying to jot down some relevant points in the scratch paper so that I can formulate a proper structure in my mind.Now, coming to specifics. For the issue essay, I know that the ets site  states that you do not require any prior knowledge for writing the essays. But I would suggest that you read up on prominent controversies in common topics like  politics, education, art and economics. Learn the life stories of some famous people in these fields so that you easily tweak the story to include in your essay depending on the topic.  Make sure you divide the essay into paragraphs and indent properly for better presentation. Categorise your points based on relevance and provide examples to substantiate your claim. Another important thing to note is to NEVER change your stance while writing. Fix your mind on a particular stance.For the argument essay, you will need to identify possible assumptions. For this, use your scratch paper again. Make sure you jot down whatever flaws you can think of, and present the most gaping flaws first, in separate paragraphs. Give suggestions on how to better state the argument, and mention how that particular flaw weakens the argument. ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT YOU MUST ALWAYS MAINTAIN A NEUTRAL STANCE. Never let your opinions get in the way of your argument essay. Make sure your essay analyses the argument objectively and back up your arguments with strong suggestions. In general, before writing any essay, decide on a proper, relevant introduction as the examiner may read your essay for less than a minute. So a good strong introduction will go a long way in impressing the examiner. I wouldn't suggest using complicated words unless you are extremely sure of their usage. Content is all that matters. Hope this helps.:)","Of all the questions given in GRE and GMA, Analytical writing questions or essays can be the trickiest. They not only judge your sense of understanding through this but also how good you are at portraying your thoughts.Have a look at the infographic which explains how to score well in AWA section:Look forward to these while preparing for the AWA section:1. It is very important to structure your essay by providing with adequate introduction, body and conclusion. A structured essay is easy to understand and increases the visibility of your idea.2. Understand the topic before you rush into writing. It might happen that you end up assuming the topic wrongly and waste your time writing wrong answer. Thus, better to take time and understand3. Be a little creative and take instances from your personal life till where it is possible. This will firstly, leave a warmly impression on the reader and will also provide him with new content helping you to score the perfect marks. Avoid internet influence.4. Use Templates as they will guide you in the best possible way to format your essays.5. While writing an essay one should keep in mind about the e-rater. Therefore, while writing, try to be grammar fluent and avoid using big words and sentences as it might contradict if you do not know the meaning.6. Proofreading is the most important step while ensuring a perfect essay. Leave aside more than a couple of minutes to spell check and rearrange any sentences if you feel you can come up with something better.These are some tips one needs to keep in mind before appearing for the AWA section.GRE and GMAT AWA Essays: Scoring a perfect 6.0 in AWA EssaysAll the Best!",My friend is starting a video series covering the various ways in which you can tackle the GRE AWA.

If you are running out of time, read the opening and closing paragraphs and skim the middle. The first and last paragraphs contain the passage’s main idea in most passages. You can go back and read body paragraphs more carefully as questions call for it.REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE QUESTION IS ASKING.Reading comprehension questions have the most “gray area” of any question type on the GRE. Some people skim through the question, not really understanding what it is specifically asking, start reading the answer choices, and pick the first one that sounds true. This is not a good strategy – many times more than one answer choice will ring true or partially true with the passage, but only one will specifically and best answer that particular question.DO NOT BRING IN OUTSIDE KNOWLEDGE.The GRE does not require you to have any outside knowledge for the reading comprehension passages, so check any you have at the door. Your own biases might actually hurt you when answering the questions, especially if it is an opinion passage.FOR ""SELECT ONE OR MORE ANSWER CHOICES"" QUESTIONS, CONSIDER EACH CHOICE SEPARATELY.For some of the reading comprehension questions, you will have to choose one, two, or three of the answers. This format can lead you to second-guess yourself more than with a typical multiple-choice question where you can eliminate choices decisively. To avoid these issues, consider each choice separately and only select it if you feel that it could be the only correct answer to the question.UNDERLINE AND TAKE NOTES AS YOU READ.Read the passage actively. Underline key words or sentences that contain the main idea. Jot down any notes, probably just a word or two, that you think might help you. If the author is taking a side on a certain issue, write a positive or negative sign next to the passage to remind yourself later what his or her position is.DON’T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS.Inferring and assuming are not the same thing. When you infer, you make an inference based on the information in the passage. When you assume, you make an assumption that brings in outside information or biases and is not based solely on the given passage. An assumption may seem valid, but if you can’t back it up with statements from the passage, it’s probably best to stay away from it.Good Luck,","A lot of students find Verbal Ability difficult to crack. And if you ask them what makes Verbal Ability their weak area, a lot of fingers would be pointing towards Reading Comprehension (RC). This article attempts to make Reading Comprehension, a less-complex area for you.While solving Reading Comprehension passages, it is essential to be alert. You should avoid simply reading the passage quickly and jumping to the questions.Because then you will be missing out on the ‘comprehension’ part of RC. In order to master your command over RC, you should know how to prepare for it. Given below are some points that will help you in your preparation.Focus on the following strategies while preparing for RC:1) Read, Read & Read: Read newspapers, editorials, magazines and novels everyday to get yourself used to different topics.2) Reading Speed: Pay attention to how you are reading the passages. If you are reading the passage word-by-word or vocalizing each word as you are reading, then you may have a low Words-per-minute rate. Your RCs will then take a lot of time to get over. Try taking in more words at a time while reading. This will help you to finish passages faster. The more you read, the more your eye can accommodate words at a time and thehigher your Words-per-minute rate will be. As a result, you will be able to comprehend sentences and phrases better as your focus will include entire groups of words rather than individual words.3) Reading vs Skimming: Read through the passages that you are unfamiliar with. Skim through passages that you’re familiar with. This will save a lot of time.4) Glancing: Glance through the questions first before attempting the passage. This will help you to pinpoint and remember key extracts while reading the passage. This will aid you in solving the questions later ahead. However, do not spend too much time on the questions at the beginning.5) Moving On: Don’t get stuck on difficult words that appear in the passage. Continue ahead and focus more on the idea being conveyed rather than specific words.6) Vocabulary: The more familiar you are with different words, the faster you will be able to read the matter. Increasing your vocabulary by learning new words and reading more often will naturally increase your reading speed.7) Smart Reading: Don’t focus on facts while reading the passage. Try to focus more on the ideas conveyed. This will help in answering questions that are inference/author’s viewpoint based.8) Central Idea: The central idea is just one idea that is stated directly or indirectly through the different parts of the passages. Most of the illustrations and examples in the passage will try to drive in the same point. So identifying this point is the key to getting the central idea right.9) Elimination: Try eliminating options in questions involving inferences and central ideas. This will also help to save time.Despite following all the advice and information given above, you will be able to tackle RCs only if you practice solving passages on a regular basis. Implement the above mentioned tips and guidelines to make RCs one of your strong areas."
GRE,Is it true that GRE in the month of January of any year is the easiest and then difficulty level rises per month?,https://www.quora.com//Is-it-true-that-GRE-in-the-month-of-January-of-any-year-is-the-easiest-and-then-difficulty-level-rises-per-month,"GRE General Test, GRE Prep Club, GRE Forum, GRE Vocabulary, GRE Score, GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",23,"GRE stands for Graduate Record Examinations. The GRE General Test administered by ETS (Educational Testing Service), is a not-for-profit company. The exam is used to assess student’s Quantitative and Verbal aptitudes and is required for admission to many graduate programs along with some masters programs.It isn’t a true thing that GRE test is specifically easy in January than all other months because GRE test is conducted and designed by ETS on a regular basis. The reason for it is that GRE test is conducted almost on a daily basis in different parts of world. The level of difficulty in this test depends on the type of vocabulary used and the extent to which mathematical problems are stated. But it is true at some point that this exam only gets tougher due to a huge competition between candidates confessing from all around the world. This mostly happens before the start of fall semester in months of July to September when the competition gets hard.In my personal opinion, start preparing for GRE on your best level instead of worrying about it’s difficulty. Prepare for it on a level which can help you make your mark in the test and achieve your goal. Your mind should be test focused so that you can undergo each problem with efficiency, whether easy or difficult in the test.","Short Answer: No (can also mean that it can’t be estimated)Longish Answer:As you might know GRE is adaptive, so difficulty during the test is set by you. Apart from that, the difficulty we’re aware of is reported by our friends who give the test (since online you find people from a huge subset). And friends don’t give GRE every month, so even that can’t be a good estimator. Also people who attempt the test on multiple occasions may find it easier in the subsequent attempts. If they don’t, then maybe they were dealt a harder set of questions (which has nothing to do with the month). Or maybe they couldn’t handle the pressure of the exam.Though people do say that year on year, the exam seems to be getting a bit more difficult, within a calendar year, month shouldn’t be a determining factor of the difficulty.","Hello Priya, Thanks on the A2A. The examination is adaptive- the level of difficulty of the second section is based upon one's performance in the first section. In addition to this, there are also other factors like the some research section(s) being added and one cannot know which section is a research section ( your performance on it is not counted) and which one is not.Moreover, the questions are also distinct. On a relativistic scale (comparison) the quantitative section is “easier” than the Verbal section. The advantage with the GRE examination is that a slot for booking vthe examination can be done through out the year.If you have any further queries, you can private message me- I would be glad to clarify them.Best Regards","Note that I retired in 2002, so my answer is based on old information. That said: no, the difficulty of the GRE General Test is not designed to change from month to month or even year to year.Actually, all GRE test forms must meet statistical standards—set by the program—so that the GRE test form taken in any month or year is statistically comparable to the GRE test form taken in any other month or year. That’s how your parent could take the GRE in 1994, for example, while you could take it in 2019, and the scores you each attain will be comparable.I hope this helps you understand why there are no difficulty-level differences in the GRE General Test. The same also goes for any GRE Subject Test."
GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It's ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!You could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your termsKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms","It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.You’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.You’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.You have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it. You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door. But, remember ‘freelancing job is also an actual job’. There’s nothing fancy about it until you make it.Before you are a freelancer you should prepare for being one. These is a simple road-map which you need to follow with determination, to make through this challenge.ACQUIRING SKILLS:This is the most important part. You need to acquire skills in whatever field you choose. You may find this boring and have an urge to jump over and look up to the offers. You may have misconceptions of having all necessary skills. But, this is the only way you can be successful in long run.Take a break to start an elaborated research in the chosen field and the specializations they demand.Look out for dummy projects to build a great portfolio. Offer to work with your peers, friends and nonprofit organizations for free.Keep a close look at people already in the industry and look up to their work. Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.MANAGING NETWORKSLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.Now that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.BEING THE BRANDThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.You need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help. Get your business cards and be ready to talk about the work you do and yourself more often.Learn some basic marketing and accounting skills. Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.THE ADVENTURE RIDENow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!Start looking out for jobs. This might be a slow-moving process, instead of getting stressed introspect your offers.At first work on project/job expecting limited or no money at all. This is to just make connection sharpening your skills and showcasing your talent. These resources might be helpful to start off: Upwork, Guru, Elance, PeoplePerHour, Freelancer, Craig list;Once you have built a quality portfolio and demonstrated your work it’s time to hunt big offers. Serve the clients with generosity, build a rapport. Businesses will start taking you seriously about your specialization.Your career will see a boost. In the long run, you can either be choosy about your project or take projects in volumes, both are keys to success. With time, you’ll be able to create a Brand which clients and businesses will look up to.Finally, keep up the good work and regularly meet other freelancers, talk them about your business. Use calling more often than emailing to a client. These things will give your brand a personal touch and also avoid the feeling of isolation. Now, you are independent and can set your own working ethics being selective about projects and jobs. The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.This answer is a part of my blog, read it here.If you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.Please do let me know your suggestions and feedback.I’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.","For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.That doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.But I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.For example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”To that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.Of course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.Here are a few:You learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.There are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.It’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.You get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?Freelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.Bottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.And you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.If you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.On the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.Once you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.","Let’s start step by step:1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.If you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:Freelancer - Hire & Find JobsUpworkCraigslistPeoplePerHour99designsGuruEngineerBabuHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.2. Build a Perfect websiteAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.While building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.Show diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.Include your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.If you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.3. Brand YourselfOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-Whether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.Along with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.Your logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.Most importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.The domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.Become a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.4. Understand the project requirement carefullyAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project.

Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.The only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.9. Be ProfessionalWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-Starting date of projectThe project’s deadlineMilestonesFunctionalitiesSchedule meeting in priorMake the clear timeline of deliverables.Professionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–Keep Your Personal Life limited to yourselfYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.  It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.Charge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.Schedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.If some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront.

Networking and Relationship with ClientsBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client.

Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at. 5. Connect at co-working space You can share your desk with other freelancers from another field; this is the best way to enrich knowledge and network.  All points listed above reinforces you to become a freelancer, your perfect profile generation for freelance success and helps you in becoming your own boss with a promising career ahead."
GRE,How much does the GRE score actually matter for graduate school admission in the US? In which programs/circumstances does it materially make a difference?,https://www.quora.com//How-much-does-the-GRE-score-actually-matter-for-graduate-school-admission-in-the-US-In-which-programs-circumstances-does-it-materially-make-a-difference,"GRE Score, Graduate School Admissions in the United States of America, Colleges and Universities in the United States of America, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions",11,"Well, in my experience, GRE serves 5 purposes:1. It is a signal to the admissions committee and the graduate school (the part of the university in charge of grads) that you're reasonably bright.2. It allows for easy sorting of applicants when there are too many.3. It provides a good ""excuse"" for denying someone admission (because if they really wanted you there, they'd find a way).4. It provides a cutoff for the university for hiring TAs. (At my U, you must have a 1000 combined to be a TA).5. It provides 1 metric for distributing fellowships.In my eyes, the only reason to try for a high GRE score is for the fellowships.Because really -- and we're talking about doctoral level here -- the most important things are:Your match with your potential advisor (otherwise it is a waste of everyone's time)Good references from other faculty in the same discipline (the most important thing)Research experience (to show that you know what you're in for) are really the most important things that contribute to admissions.If Professor X's old cohortmate Professor Y says ""You'll love Bob! He's amazing."" and Bob did a good job telling the the admissions committee why he is a good match for a particular faculty member, Bob is in.At the master's level, IMHO, many of these programs are cash cows for the school anyway, so GRE is just a signal that you won't royally screw up.","To get admission in universities in the US you can be expected to have either few or all of the following points:1. Good GRE/TOEFL Scores: - Though not a requisite but TOEFL/GRE scores play an important role at some level. They may considered as a first filter.2. Good Research Papers/Projects - This does not mean copying some one else's paper and publishing it or getting your major project made by someone else and showcasing it for your profile. Here quality and not quantity matters. Though you might be expected to have at least a minimum of 2-3 research papers for admission towards MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, UCSD.3. Intelligent Search for Departmental Programs - Even though if you are a brilliant student with excellent academic performances and good/awesome papers but you apply to departments at prestigious universities where the research you are applying for/interested for is dormant or the professor doesn't have funds to accommodate new students, then it is simply a waste of your money if you apply to a top university but are rejected there simply because they cant accommodate you. I have seen profiles where an IITian had been rejected at MIT because the research field in which he was interested, the professor related to that field was going tor retire in a couple of months. Now, you may ask how we can predict all these parameters and situations! Simply mail the faculty or check his personal profile page on the departmental website and match his research interests with yours. Normally faculties don't have time and don't reply to prospective students. So you can contact existing students of that research group via Facebook/LinkedIN and ask them about the current funding scenarios.4. Extra Curriculars: - Don't know about other universities, but MIT definitely looks for these extra curriculars to differentiate prospective students from others. They want an All Rounder Person for their academic programs. So if you dont have then better garner some extra curricular brownies for your profile. And by extra curriculars, I don't mean singing, dancing and other regular stuffs. Try volunteering at an NGO or any other place.5. Leadership Positions: - If you are a member of international professional organizations such as IEEE, SAE and have volunteered at any leadership ladder, then it surely adds some brownie points to your profile.So GRE scores are not the decision making point. One might consider them as initial filter, but not the decisive point !Hope that helps. All the best :)","GRE is NOT a selective measure but a REJECTIVE measure. This means that if you score less than lets say 315 for an IVY league college you have high chances of getting rejected in the preliminary rounds itself however if you score above 330 it does not leverage you in any form. It just means that you have lesser chances of getting rejected in the initial rounds of scrutiny. Now the Admission Process for US Universities is a Black Box and there are a lot of theories regarding it. Personally, this is the one which seems most trustworthy to me as it appeals to logic.Numbers in the form of GRE Scores, TOEFL Scores, CGPA are your first filter. I am not saying all of them are but some/most of them. Why ? Simple, If you have millions of applications each year coming in , how do you short list them to thousands ? Do you open each SOP/LOR/Resume and evaluate them or do you put a number filter ? I personally think to short list from such a huge pool of applications a number filter (GRE/TOEFL/CGPA) is the first step. When you are to thousands you can afford to open up and glance through people’s SOP/LOR/Resume.. One can argue with me and cite aberrations that occur every year but as I said this is my personal opinion and I would not like to go with the aberrations.More details at my Blog Post : Prepare for the GRE in a month","A lot depends on a lot. Generally GRE scores are important but as someone has said more important if you score low than high. Some places automatically do not consider applications with low GREs, some don't. For physical sciences and math, GRE scores below 700 or even 750 would be considered low.  Graduate admissions is still a very human enterprise. That means that individuals will read the application and some care more about GRE than others. Some folks assign importance to  GPA, others personal statements more than GRE, some not. And if you've had favorable contact with a particular professor or have a letter of recommendation from someone he/she respects that professor may well argue for admitting you even with less than ideal GRE scores. Keep in mind that none of this stuff predicts success in grad school very well (probably previous successful research experience works best), so arguments in admissions committee meetings over who to admit can have a passion which often accompanies decisions with working with flawed information and pet theories which have limited validity.So the only sensible answer is that at some places and in some fields it will matter more than in others."
GRE,Is 320 a decent GRE score for good universities in the USA?,https://www.quora.com//Is-320-a-decent-GRE-score-for-good-universities-in-the-USA,"Colleges and Universities in the United States of America, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",8,"The definition of a ""good"" score definitely depends on how ""good"" the programs you're applying to are. As Franck mentioned, using the percentile rank is a good place to start. A 90th percentile in verbal is about a 162+, and in quant, it's about a 164+ (you can find your personal percentile ranks here: GRE Score Percentiles). Now, of course if you're applying to science/math programs, you'll want your quant score to be higher than verbal, and vice versa for humanities/arts (although scoring high on both sections is the ultimate goal, right!?). I don't know the types of programs you intend to apply to, or what specific schools, but these resources may help: Programs (these will show you the scores you should aimed for based on your intended area of study):- GRE Scores for Engineering Programs - GRE Scores for Science Programs - GRE Scores for Arts and Humanities Programs- GRE Scores for Education Programs- GRE Scores for Social Science Programs- GRE Scores for Life Sciences ProgramsScores based on specific schools (these show you the scores you should aim for based on schools): - Harvard GRE Scores- Stanford GRE Scores - MIT GRE Scores | Magoosh GRE Blog - UC Berkeley GRE Scores- Columbia GRE Scores - UCLA GRE Scores | Magoosh GRE Blog- Yale GRE Scores | Magoosh GRE Blog- Princeton GRE Scores- USC GRE Scores | Magoosh GRE Blog Hope that helps!Edit, 2/5/2014: All of this info is now in a easy-to-read slideshare, which you can find here: [Announcement] Your favorite post is now a Slideshare! Same info, but looks nicer, like this!: ","320 is always an above par score.Most good universities doesn't look at GRE. They focus on the entire profile and there are many other things that they take into picture other than GRE.For example, all top universities look at your research experience, some look at your research interests (only to find that you are interested in that program), some other universities look for good academics as they believe good cgpa represents good foundation in basics and some look for good extra curriculars as they want to find leaders who can lead.On the contrary, even a 340 cannot guarantee you an admission into these, so called, good universities unless you have an overall profile that matters.SOP (Statement of Purpose) is very important in deciding your admission rather than GRE. This two paper letter submitted by you plays a very crucial which helps to advertise yourself in a way that universities cannot find a loop hole to reject you.One last thing. GRE is an exam in which we can top with 2 months of good preparation. They never over estimate a candidate based on GRE score as there is a lot more to evaluate about your four years of undergraduation. Don't feel bad even if you have score lower than 320 but make sure your over all profile looks good.","First of all you need to decide which program you are asking this question for, because the goodness of a GRE score is determined by the program you choose. Secondly, It also depends on your profile overall. If you have a very strong profile otherwise then GRE holds a very small weightage. Match your profile (college, work ex etc.) with the program and university you want to apply to. Few colleges may have a cutoff though. Though I have seen student with less than 320 score getting into very good universities, just because their profiles were excellent and were in sync with what his specialization was.","Have written a blog after taking interview of a current student of “Carnegie Mellon University” on his view on how to get in US universities, may be this can be helpful.Expert Advice to get in Carnegie Mellon UniversityEvery week on Monday we publish an interview of current student from US universities in ConnectBud."
GRE,What is it like for an Indian student to pursue an MS or PhD from a US or European university?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-it-like-for-an-Indian-student-to-pursue-an-MS-or-PhD-from-a-US-or-European-university,"European University Institute, College and University Experience Advice, Undergraduate Studies, Higher Education in the United States of America, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), The College and University Experience, Academic and Educational Advice",27,"Well there it depends on a lot of factors. Most importantly it depends on where you did your undergrad studies in India. If you belong to an IIT or a top NIT you may not find the teaching up to the mark. Most of the time the lectures are very superficial and deep understanding of subject matter is not ensured by the professors. They expect students to do a lot of self study. In France, the lectures are of 2 hours duration which is very rare in India. I can hardly concentrate after 1 hr. So, ensure that you sleep well in the night before going to a class in the morning. But you will feel good about a lot of things here. Everyone is punctual. I have been here for 2 months and I have never seen a professor come late to class. Till date not a single lecture has been cancelled. The laboratories are super awesome. You will find that each lab has developed its own tools and software to carry out the practicals. The lab experiments are very close to the industry standards. For example this semester I have a lab on study of OSEK Real time systems which is being used presently in designing the electronic control system of automobiles. The assignments are really challenging. Not a single question copied from any standard textbook. Another important thing, people here pay a lot of attention on presentation of subject matter. They expect the assignments to be well written with excellent explanation. Hand written reports are generally discouraged and students are really good when it comes to using tools like Latex, Prezi and MS office. So, if one is clever with concepts but cannot reproduce it with the same clarity in his reports then he/she is likely to get lesser grades.Assignments are very meticulously checked by the professor himself (not by his PhD student). This is something that one will not find even in the best IITs.Group work is highly encouraged. I see people forming groups and studying late into the night in the university labs. The professors are very very approachable. Sometimes as approachable as a friend. You can contact anytime and clarify your doubts. If they cannot , they usually send you handouts and books on your email to help you understand the topic.Most importantly you never have to cram formulas here, everything is provided in the question paper. You just have to use them. Most of the exams are open book , but questions are difficult. I never found any standard text book problem in the exams. Past year questions are seldom repeated.","I feel delighted to be doing MS in US. Few of the reasons are1) Excellent teaching: Here professors always try to teach courses to let it be attractive to students as well as Industry. They take it as their responsibility that the concepts are well understood by students. So, a lot of interesting homework and assignment follows hard topics. It is a pain to do them in between semester when there are lots of them to be done but in the end you feel good that you have learnt and applied something which would have been categorized as ""geeky"" back home and friends would have boasted of leaving it. Here, after the end of semester you feel really great to have done things which you were scared of doing. Especially if any subjects require programming, you will soon be proud that you wrote your own code with complex things inside it right from scratch. Everyone'e implementation would be different. You learn lot of new things discussing over that.2) Passionate students: In every class here, mostly all of the students in that  class are taking that course because they want to and not because they have to. So, teacher doesn't have to face impassionate crowd who wants to learn the minimum and try to get classes cancelled to the maximum. Also there is no attendance here. Infact, in all my classes attendance was never ever discussed. Also, in case you have to miss some classes because of some reason, professor will try within his limits to help you.3) Excellent courses: Here universities are huge. They have lots of department and each of them doing genuine work and most of the time great work. You can take course from any department upto a certain number of credits. This gives an option of joining music, arts etc. which wouldn't have been possible in universities in India. Also every departments have new courses coming up as per trends of Industry or research so you can always enjoy the latest.4) Provision of Teaching Assistants and Graders: Few of the reason for not giving homeworks or giving bad quality homework in India is that very few teachers and subjects have position of TAs and graders. When teacher can offload this trivial tasks to others, he/she can put more effort on course.5) Quality of professors: Here, for a professor to be promoted, he has to do good research and bring in funds. This promotes quality in his work. Here professors are those people who know their subject very well and have worked years on it doing something new. So, here the best people become professors atleast at the college level. In India, its mostly the reverse, many people become professors because they couldn't do anything else. So, they end up teaching the same things for decades in same way, sometimes themselves not knowing details of it and the latest development in their field. After seeing how the undergrads work here, I have developed a great respect for them. I believe even if their GPA is 2/4 here, they would actually know their subject better then possibly an 8/10 pointer in India. This is not just in engineering, I have seen even History students here have to do a lot of work themselves and not just copying. So, anything which is taught here is taught here with the best intention.I believe this is a very big reason why America leads in innovation. They may have very few under-graduates than India but whoever it is, they are far better than combined knowledge of many Indian under-graduates.One thing which I disliked here: Here most of the students write their exam papers and homeworks in a very ugly fashion. In fact it is so bad that atleast half of the class would get zero if the paper was checked in an Indian college or school. Here they write as if it is the teachers job to find out where the answer is in the sheet.One important point, I am doing MS in a university which counts in top 25 in US and so my analysis is based on what I see here. Here average GPA to get in undergrad courses is A (3.98/4).It may be possible that lowly ranked universities here may degrade to levels in India but I am not sure about it. From what I can understand, atleast top 100 colleges here would be within limits of top 10 of India.","I will answer this question from the point of view of an undergraduate and I am going to remain anonymous as I a still studying with these folks so bear with me. Due to the nature of my studies, most of classes are at the graduate level because undergraduate classes cannot satisfy my degree requirements and consequently I have a fair amount of interaction with Indian students who have come to the U.S. for their M.S. studies.The one thing that I have seen is that adventurousness seems to be an all time low for most of the students and this goes as far as them feeling totally helpless when in fact they should be relieved that they do not have to speak in a language other than English. 1. If you can, choose housing that is right between an ""Indian Enclave"" and your school. This will help you in meeting non-Indians and will make you more sociable and will make your study period more fun.2. When it comes to choosing classes, the best person to turn to is your advisor. Please do not go to your seniors, if you want to call them that, to help you make your schedule. 3. I understand that being in a foreign land can be a bit isolating and you feel the need to interact with fellow Indians; this should not mean that you ignore life outside your social circle. 4. I chose a totally new academic line and for me it has not been easy but I rolled the dice and it ended up working out for me just fine. Have the courage and the curiosity to explore new things and at the same time define your values. 5. Yes GPA will matter no matter what but if you use your time wisely and do a lot of projects by working with profs in your school it will give you skills, establish a professional network and possibly be able to get you to an interview. 6. Don't be sensitive. Indians have a terrible reputation of being overly sensitive to any criticism of India, it's culture or it's people. Please understand that each and every person has a right to their opinion and that does not mean that they are racist. 7. Copying assignments and code is not going to get you far and non-Indian students as well as faculty know this too well. If you happen to find yourself in such a group please stay away from them. A ""B"" earned through your own work is much better than an ""A"" earned by copying.8. African Americans (blacks) are not criminals and please don't say things like ""kaaliya"" or ""chocolate"" when they are around. They know what that means and it is very degrading. Same goes for fellow Asian students, please don't say things like ""chinkies"" and ""ching-chong-ting-tong"" it is highly un-professional and only makes the entire Indian student body look bad. At the end of the day, your degree will be what you make of it. Also, I am an Indian in case readers have their doubts. Enjoy your stay and welcome to the United States!","From IITKGP (BSc + MSc) to Ghent University (PhD). Some things that I observed:You can treat a professor like an equal here. Talk to them openly about everything, go out for drinks with them, and crack jokes. There were only a couple of professors in IIT KGP with whom I could imagine doing all that. Graduate students here are on average way more smart than the undergrad students and not the other way around, as it is in IITs. Computer science is not the most sought after branch to study in a university, at least not here in Belgium. The smartest people usually end up taking maths or engineering. In many university courses group projects and group activities are a norm while I rarely saw that in India. Also, I have heard that copying of assignments doesn't happen much. In India I had never heard of or faced a situation where someone says ""Oh, you are studying maths! You must be really smart."" while here it seems like a very common thing to say. One of the questions that I posted a few months after coming here: What are some good ways to respond to ""Oh! You must be really smart!"" when you tell someone that you are doing a PhD in math?Europeans love their holidays! Sometimes a little too much. I don't mind if we are allowed to take 35 days off in an year and to not work at all on weekends but it gets annoying when you feel like you are obliged to do so. Your peers expect from you that you would never work on a weekend and they treat you as a weirdo if you do. The university deducts your holiday money for the next year if you do not officially take 35 days off this year! I work when I want to work, and luckily in the work that I am doing right now I can afford to do so. The shops do not open on Sundays! That is among the most annoying things that I have faced. People assume that if you are a vegetarian then you must eat only salad. Non-vegetarianism is the norm and not the other way around. Things are changing a little now. But I miss all the easily accessible and diverse vegetarian food, gol gappe, samosa, pav bhaji, dosa, uttapam, pakode, paranthe, ... :'("
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How good is a GRE score of 302?,https://www.quora.com//How-good-is-a-GRE-score-of-302,"GRE Score, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",17,"Universities look at a candidates complete profile. Let’s take your case as an example since you have done a great job in providing most of your details. What do universities look at when evaluating a profile:Quantitative scores: Grades, GRE scores etc. Your latest grade, 67% in BE, is an average score. Your GRE score, all sections are on the lower side. For MS in any engineering or science program, universities place importance on Quants, then AW, then verbal. So score above 163–165 on Quants, at least 4.0 on AW and above the minimum required for verbal (which should be listed on the universities website) or at the very least 1 standard deviation below the average (some universities list average scores instead of minimum). I recommend reading GRE Scores - The Good, Bad and Ugly for in depth insights on GRE scores.Ranking of your bachelor’s university: A 60% in IIT is valued much more than 90% in a Sido Kanhu Murmu University type university.SOP: This is the heart of your application. A well written statement can get you into your top choice university. A well-thought out SOP has the following qualities:Unique. It has to be about you. Your story, your goals, your personality should shine through, reasons why you want to apply to this particular university etc. Uniqueness gives rise to…Authenticity. Be genuine. Don’t make up stories or challenges you overcame. Authenticity also comes from…Depth. When thinking about your goals, the reasons you want to apply to a university, focus on depth. The more you think about reasons for each and every decision, the more authentic it will be. Keep asking yourself questions. Don’t settle on an answer till you’re satisfied with it. Get to the point where no one can break through your reasoning for any decision. With depth comes…Specifics. Answer each question with details. If you can’t answer a question, research. Find out why you want to go to a particular university or why you want to apply to a particular degree. Write out specifics in…Simple, effective language. There’s no need for eloquent literature or Shakespearean English. Keep it simple, clear and easily understandable while also being…To the point. Don’t beat around the bush. Write crisp sentences, get your point across quickly and move on to the next point.I have a detailed blog post about the must haves in your statement of purpose.LOR: Just like a restaurant has to have great reviews before you eat there, so do you to get into a good university. It seems that you have this covered.With all this in mind (and without reading your SOP), I think USF, ASU and Northeastern are safe choices. You’re on the borderline for UF and UTD.Good luck!Edit:Additionally, a score of 302 for your GRE is on the lower side. Your best bet is to increase your GRE scores above 310 or 315.I’ve captured this sentiment in depth here! Enjoy!","Ruili, both the verbal and quantitative GRE scores have a range from 130 to 170 - average 150. So the combined average is 300. Thus 302 is a shade above average. In my opinion it would not, by itself, gain you entry to a good school for a Master's in CS. Sorry!  But are you not rather late for admission in the Fall of 2015? Best wishes.On another point which applies to many QUORA questions, see below on the confidentiality of GRE scores. All GRE score users should be aware of the confidential nature of the scores and agree to maintain their confidentiality. Institutional policies should be developed to ensure that confidentiality is maintained. For example, GRE scores should not be placed on documents sent outside the institution.","Thanks for A2AA GRE score of 302 can take you places...maybe not the Ivy Leagues and the top 10 grad-schools, but places nonetheless!What Universities Can I Target with GRE: 300-310?To start with, here are a few of the ‘achievable’ universities you can target with a GRE score in the range of 300-310:Texas A&M KingsvilleSUNY BuffaloSUNY Stony BrookUT-DallasUT-ArlingtonSJSUThe University of Louisiana - LafayetteIllinois Institute of Technology - ChicagoRochester Institute of TechnologyUniversity of HoustonDownload GRE Cutoff scores for top 35 US Universities hereBut does this mean you can’t target the TOP 25 with your score?GRE score requirements are not concrete, and there are several instances of students who land above-average or top admits, despite a GRE score not even close to the university average score of admitted students.

Hence, how good your score is, depends on these factors:Your Verbal & Quants percentile scoresThe GRE score required for that program/university.Checkout our eBOOK on 5 Techniques to score 170 in QuantsLet’s talk percentiles. Percentiles are a measure of what percentage of other GRE takers have a score lower than you. Hence, the higher your percentile, the better your chances!ETS, the organization that conducts the GRE calculates percentiles separately for Verbal, Quant, and AWA.As you mentioned, you have a 144 and 158 on your Verbal and Quants section respectively.Take a look at your individual score percentiles below (source: ETS)Decoding the Data - What matters more for you?Broadly speaking you need a higher score on the section more closely related to your field. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) Courses like Computer Science, in your case, place more emphasis on a higher Quants percentile whereas Ph.D. courses in thesis-based subjects often require a higher verbal score!Noticed how the Verbal percentiles are higher than Quant percentiles throughout?The difference between verbal and quants scores is especially more pronounced in countries such as India where more students score better in the Quants section owing to a higher priority given to developing mathematical skills coupled with the engineering background that most test-takers share! Thus, to get a higher Quants percentile, you’d need a higher Quants score than Verbal!Aiming for a high Quants Score? Then Download GRE Quant Formula Book for a perfect 170 ScoreWhat is a Good Percentile?Roughly speaking, any score above the 50% mark is considered good, with a percentile above 70% considered excellent!This means, a score of 151 or more on Verbal and 153 or more in Quant is considered good. Anything below that and it means that most test-takers scored higher than you.Given the fact that your Quants score is 158, and you’re applying to a STEM course, you’re already at an advantage - with your score being higher than almost 70% of test takers!Now, coming to what you really wanted to know…What is the BEST you can target with your score?Your admits are only as good as your profile is - of which your GRE is JUST one part!The internet is jam-packed with the score requirements of universities and the average GRE scores of students admitted.But does that mean that these boundaries are set in stone? Definitely not!There are several instances of students who land above-average or top admits, despite a GRE score that’s even close to the average score of admitted students.You can also get into some very prestigious universities by applying to niche courses, or having skills that aren’t really commonplace. Applying to universities with a large intake like say, SJSU or USC helps too!So what else do the universities consider?

But I did use GREedge and can vouch for it.I recently gave my GRE and can say confidently that I scored a good score. DUring the start of my preparations a few months before I too was confused between the two and while enrolling was thinking on for which of these two online preps should I register for. For me the choice was simple as I did want to score better than last year. I went with GREedge for a simple reason that it's based out of India where I am from and It did have positive reviews and recommendations from some who had earlier enrolled for their prep courses.I enrolled two months before my exam and took an appropriate course. The course material was very thorough, both for the verbal and Quant Sections. Their SFA’s (Student Advisors) were very supportive and did answer all the doubts and questions posed to them, with additional materials to practise whenever requested. I personally found them good at their jobs in guiding students. They also assisted in completing the course on schedule. Their web interface was also pretty adaptable and could start at get go from the very beginning. Just had an issue with their word bots but then am pretty bad at mugging up things leave alone 8000+ words. Even after enrolling to any of the courses (which you must choose after a good research about either of them so that they are suitable for you, just keep in mind its always better if you also parallely prepare in your own time with the additional materials because the better you practise the better score you get. So, all the best.","I recently gave my GRE scored 311{Q:162;V:149;W:4}. Some may find this to be a very average score as compared to 320+ or 330+ which people get so frequently. Then again we should primarily understand that we do not learn anything new for the purpose of taking GRE, instead our aptitude is tested on the things we already know and have had these stuff as a part of our coursework at some part of our academics. I have a lot of respect for the people who do not prefer any assistance while preparation.However I felt that I needed some assistance as I was out of touch with academics for 2 years almost. Also the people whom I live with at present are not into such a culture. I enrolled for GRE-EDGE as a few of my batchmates had already excelled in GRE with this organisation and suggested me to take up one of their programs. I would try to be as much unbiased as possible and go on with my experience as I never enrolled for magoosh as most of their material were already availavle in form of free apps or free videos.Now what I liked about EDGE was that they had variety of difficulty levels. So I was bound to practice more and more. A personal facilitator is assigned to every enrolled student who would provide constant feedback to the student. In my case I took the initiative to go after my facilitators, I used to e-mail them on a regular basis and they would get back to me on mail with resoonse to each and every query.I felt the 2 major regions where I feel I was got the benifit out of the program were:-Time Management: EDGE questions(advanced practice+mock) are having higher difficulty levels. In my actual GRE I had a lot of time to go back to each question and revise.Question Oreintation: My facilitators had mailed me certain materials apart from the learning portal. Mostly PDF samples, which gave me idea on certain tips and tricks(4Q), slideshows for SE and RC tricks, sample essays (4W) rated 1–6 like how I should write and how I should not.I feel GRE-EDGE even though is not as famous as magoosh, but they do offer valued service an you can well go ahead with any one of their programs.","I was enrolled with GRE edge for 4 months and I must say that their service is really pathetic. Their so called “ Personal SFA’s “ call only when they have another offer for u ( like when they want you to subscribe for the TOEFL prep on their portal ). My verbal sfa never picked up the call and their is always this communication gap. What these SFA’s do is basically they chalk out a plan , and that’s it. The plan is created in such a manner that u complete the whole portal before ur GRE (including some style tests and a few full tests as well). So their is no rocket science in this.During these 4 months , I was contacted only 4–5 times by them . ( That's how personal they get. ) I expected these guys to call me at least before my D day to discuss any sought of plans or strategies or a little motivation maybe!! But I Only received a computer generated mail and text sms saying all the best , and a few tips here and their. That's it.Content wise they are okay . But do not expect anything more. Also , their portal looks very out dated and mechanical. ( No videos , only text,) I also found it hard to skip topics sometimes. (Unless you complete the one before ) So it does lack a sense of flexibility .The only thing I liked was the wordbot app which helps u to learn words using mnemonics. You can even revise words by filtering out the list u are focusing on .In conclusion i would say that, it really depends on your preparation level and what score you are aiming for. It’s always better to go for standard books and materials. I haven’t used magoosh , but from what i have heard , their content ,videos,strategies are top notch and they have been in this race for quiet a long time .And they do stand out when it comes to the content. (without any doubt). It would be wise to not get fooled by terms like “Personal SFA” or “Personal tutor”. Ultimately it’s all your effort that adds up. The only reason why i took up online GREEdge was because i had to juggle between my job and gre prep(otherwise i would have opted for physical classes rather than online), and i thought that this concept of “personal SFA” might keep me focused throughout the journey. But only later i realized how cleverly this B.S. concept was sold to me .P.S. Not trying to denigrate GreEdge . Some XYZ might have had a better experience than i had, and it’s totally fine. Just thought that it would be great to share it in a forum . Cheers!"
GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It's ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!You could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your termsKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms","It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.You’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.You’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.You have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it. You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door. But, remember ‘freelancing job is also an actual job’. There’s nothing fancy about it until you make it.Before you are a freelancer you should prepare for being one. These is a simple road-map which you need to follow with determination, to make through this challenge.ACQUIRING SKILLS:This is the most important part. You need to acquire skills in whatever field you choose. You may find this boring and have an urge to jump over and look up to the offers. You may have misconceptions of having all necessary skills. But, this is the only way you can be successful in long run.Take a break to start an elaborated research in the chosen field and the specializations they demand.Look out for dummy projects to build a great portfolio. Offer to work with your peers, friends and nonprofit organizations for free.Keep a close look at people already in the industry and look up to their work. Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.MANAGING NETWORKSLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.Now that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.BEING THE BRANDThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.You need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help. Get your business cards and be ready to talk about the work you do and yourself more often.Learn some basic marketing and accounting skills. Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.THE ADVENTURE RIDENow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!Start looking out for jobs. This might be a slow-moving process, instead of getting stressed introspect your offers.At first work on project/job expecting limited or no money at all. This is to just make connection sharpening your skills and showcasing your talent. These resources might be helpful to start off: Upwork, Guru, Elance, PeoplePerHour, Freelancer, Craig list;Once you have built a quality portfolio and demonstrated your work it’s time to hunt big offers. Serve the clients with generosity, build a rapport. Businesses will start taking you seriously about your specialization.Your career will see a boost. In the long run, you can either be choosy about your project or take projects in volumes, both are keys to success. With time, you’ll be able to create a Brand which clients and businesses will look up to.Finally, keep up the good work and regularly meet other freelancers, talk them about your business. Use calling more often than emailing to a client. These things will give your brand a personal touch and also avoid the feeling of isolation. Now, you are independent and can set your own working ethics being selective about projects and jobs. The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.This answer is a part of my blog, read it here.If you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.Please do let me know your suggestions and feedback.I’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.","For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.That doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.But I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.For example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”To that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.Of course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.Here are a few:You learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.There are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.It’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.You get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?Freelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.Bottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.And you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.If you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.On the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.Once you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.","Let’s start step by step:1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.If you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:Freelancer - Hire & Find JobsUpworkCraigslistPeoplePerHour99designsGuruEngineerBabuHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.2. Build a Perfect websiteAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.While building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.Show diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.Include your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.If you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.3. Brand YourselfOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-Whether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.Along with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.Your logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.Most importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.The domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.Become a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.4. Understand the project requirement carefullyAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day.

GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It's ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!You could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your termsKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms","It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.You’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.You’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.You have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it. You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door.

Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.MANAGING NETWORKSLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network.

Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.Now that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.BEING THE BRANDThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.You need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out.

Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help.

The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.This answer is a part of my blog, read it here.If you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.Please do let me know your suggestions and feedback.I’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.","For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.That doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.But I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.For example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”To that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.Of course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.Here are a few:You learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.There are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.It’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.You get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?Freelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.Bottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.And you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.If you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.On the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.Once you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.","Let’s start step by step:1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.If you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:Freelancer - Hire & Find JobsUpworkCraigslistPeoplePerHour99designsGuruEngineerBabuHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.2. Build a Perfect websiteAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.While building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.Show diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.Include your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.If you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.3. Brand YourselfOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-Whether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.Along with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.Your logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.Most importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.The domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.Become a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.4. Understand the project requirement carefullyAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client.

GRE,How can I increase my GRE score?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-increase-my-GRE-score,"GRE Score, GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",12,"311 is definitely not a bad score(in general). Unfortunately u have mentioned nothing about your profile. Also you have not mentioned about current branch and your intended major branch. So giving advice is a bit difficult.First of all doing masters in US/Canada, is totally different from studying in India. Since you have given GRE you might be aware of the admission process, so I won’t elaborate on it. But the important thing to know is that, while applying for master, they not only see your GRE & TOEFL scores, but also your extra curricular activities like academics, research papers, internships, social work, Good Projects, SOP, LORs, are also considered. I will elaborate on each of these individually.First for applying to any ‘good’ US university, you need to have good academics (irrespective of your major). Academics are going to play a major role in your admission. If you have good academics(ie. NO BACKLOGS and good percentages/pointer) then surely it would be easier to get admission in a good college. Good academics prove that you are a very good student academically and they won’t hesitate you to give you an admit.Second, internships and research papers are going to add weightage to your profile. Having a 1–2 internship or 1 research paper would definitely add to your chances of getting into a better college. They prove that you are interested in hardwork and research field, so they won’t mind admitting you to their college. The internship and/or research papers, prove beneficial in majors such as Computer Science or Electronics branch. There are too many students applying for these branches and in order to make your profile stand out from the scores of other profiles from across the globe, internships/research papers will definitely help you out.Third, people in USA definitely believe in social work, and it has a high importance if you have participated in any social activity(and have a certificate for it). It definitely will help you improve your profile.Fourth, SOP and LOR’s also play a important role. If you have a good SOP then you have the advantage. Also try to convince top faculties like senior professors, HOD or even Principal to recommend your name (to the university you want). This would definitely add advantage to your profile.Lastly, if you have experience of working on projects or have experience of working in some good company then it would definitely help. This is especially necessary if you are applying for CS branch as your major. Also your final year project is of great importance. And if you have extra certifications, like Oracle or Microsoft(for CS), CISCO(for electronics), AUTOCAD(mech and civil), then also your profile will get an upper hand over others.NOW YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY I GAVE SO MUCH DESCRIPTION OF ALL THESE THINGS.DON’T GET NERVOUS BECAUSE OF GRE SCORE OF 311.If you have the above things then you need not take the GRE again. Suppose you have 2 things like very good academics(You are in top 5 of your current univ) and have a good internship(of 1 or 3 months) or a research paper under your belt, then you need not retake your GRE. It is a very good score and you can definitely compete a student for a seat who has GRE score of 322(hands down). So you definitely need to check where you stand in all these, which all of the above mentioned “things” highlight your profile. I am emphasizing because you definitely start working on your SOP and LOR as early as possible. The admission is on first come first serve basis. So if you start applying to universities as early as October, then you will have a great chance to securing an admission as early as November or December. The more early you apply, the better chances you have of getting an early admit.Now since you have not mentioned about your profile, I would also tell you about the worst case scenario, i.e. you have nothing from the things I mentioned above(suppose, I hope not), then my friend you definitely need to retake the GRE.SO HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR SCORE.Since you are continuously, scoring 165 in Quants, then you need to just try and stretch your score by 4–5 marks, which is quite easy(i guess). It can only achieved by solving difficult problems from the Manhattan 5LB or you can always refer net. If you feel like you are lagging behind in a single topic like for eg, Geometry, then practice is the only option. If you are stuck in high level problems of any topics(in general) then you need to solve advance problems and also you need to improve your timing for simple problems. Now looking at your quant score of 165(i guess), you are easily able to solve simple, moderate and a few advanced problems. Now you just need to improve your speed in simple and moderate problems, so that you can shift you attention to the advanced problems. For example, if you are able to solve 1 question in 90sec, then you should bring it down to 75–80 sec for each problem. The extra 10–15 sec/problem would definitely help you get more problems in advanced problems. More time means more chances of getting a advanced problem correct. PLEASE DON’T DROP YOUR EFFICIENCY OF CURRENT QUESTIONS WHICH YOU ARE GETTING CORRECT. You need to improve in time and not drop your efficiency.NOW GETTING TO THE VERBAL PART. THIS PART IS DIFFICULT FOR THE MOST OF THE PEOPLE(including me).You need to strategize in order to score good. First if you get long passage don’t get stuck on them. In my opinion, you can first complete all the fill in the blanks. But, to fill in the blanks correctly, you need to have good command over your words. They need to memorized perfectly. You need to practice them regularly without any mistake and you should know where and when to use a word in the sentence. For that only practice and good knowledge of vocab is necessary. If you have not learnt words perfectly, then I m sorry to say, you Cannot crack the questions. Now coming to passages, start with the smaller ones, then the medium ones and lastly the long ones. This would help, since there is generally only 1 long passages with say 3–4 questions, you can get atleast 1 question correct. But from the remaining 16–17 questions you will have to score at least 12–14 to get a good score out of 20. Don’t waste your unnecessary time on long passages. So according to my calculations(u get 13 correct in both the sections of verbal), U can get a score of 156 in verbal and 169–170 in quant which would help you to get to score of 325.GRE HAS A SIMPLE RULE:PRACTICE MORE, AND CARRY YOUR LUCK DURING THE EXAM.(Luck is important, if you hate verbal and unfortunately u get a verbal in experimental, then it would be bad, because no one wants to see the verbal section thrice in those 4 hr marathon race.)Hope I have satisfied you to a certain extent.IF YOU MENTION YOUR PROFILE IN DETAIL, I WOULD DEFINITELY LOVE TO HELP YOU(whether you should retake the GRE and any other doubts).MY SUGGESTION: IF YOU HAVE GOOD PROFILE, THEN BETTER START WITH YOUR SOP,TRANSCRIPTS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS.BEST OF LUCK.","Majority of students spend between two and three months preparing for the GRE. Given we all struggle to sustain our attention and concentration for more than this long, such a duration makes perfect sense. After all, life’s inevitable “bumps” and distractions are far more likely to derail you during a six months studying for the GRE that you are better off giving it your all over a period of 2 to 3 months. Here is the perfect plan for those who can commit both the time and the cognitive resources necessary for a few months.A study plan of Catking will give structure to your preparation and will ensure that you are preparing the right way.MONTH 1: Target QuantGRE tests you on high school Maths only. You will not be tested on advanced topics such as calculus.• The GRE Maths maybe a little more intimidating for you if you didn’t have Maths in high school. Though the engineering students may not find Maths tested on the GRE to be very challenging, but they will see that they would have forgotten quite a few concepts and you may know how to solve a question but you may not know how best to solve a question.Go through the GRE Study material provided by CATKingStart going through the Maths concepts from the Official Guide and simultaneously start with the Quant concepts and formulae document in our lesson module section to get familiar with what you’d be up against.• Go through the topics one by one and do a sufficient number of questions from each topic so that you understand not only the concepts but their application too.• Start taking maths tests from our online test and do a thorough analysis of the questions.•Once you’ve identified the weak area, patch up those areas by going through the topic again and spending sometime on it. By the end of one month, you should be prepared enough for Maths and you should be ready to move on to the next challenge that is verbal.MONTH 2: Focus on VerbalStart with a topics provided in lesson modules, learn the strategies and then practice 10-15 questions from that topic per day. Make sure that you spend a good amount of time in analyzing the questions.•If you would have been reading editorials daily as suggested in month 1, by the second month, your comprehension skills would have improved quite a lot and you should be able to read complex passages. As you prepare for Verbal in the second month, remember that you do not stop studying Maths altogether. A good idea is to do 5 Maths questions everyday so that you feel that you are in touch with maths.•For Sentence Equivalence and Text Completion, you’ll have to primarily do Vocabulary, so in the first week, learn root words. This will make learning words a much more logical process and will give you a good foundation to learn words. Check out Verbal ability videos on Youtube which would also help you to prepare for GRE• Book your GRE date in the second week.• In the second week, practice Text Completion and Sentence Equivalence questions. If you’d have gone as per the suggested plan, you shouldn’t face much difficulty in doing these questions. Do not freak out learning very difficult words.• Start with the Reading comprehension part in the third week of this month. Go through the Types of questions tested on. Learn the strategies for tackling each type of question. For example, the strategy for tackling an inference question is absolutely different from that used for tackling detail questions.MONTH 3: Practicing and ReviewingThis month should be spent in taking full length tests, reviewing them and addressing your test taking weaknesses.•Take two full length tests provided by CATking. Take these practice tests preferably at the same time of the day for which you have booked your slot for. This will help your body get used to the timing.•In the first week, book your GRE date, if you haven’t already done so. In some testing centres, the GRE dates may not be easily available all the more so during the peak test taking season so it’s best to book it in the second month itself.•In the third week, take two more full length tests. Save one for the last week.•In the last week, take only one exam. Make sure that you take this exam at least 3 days before the exam.•Sleep well during the last few days. Do not study anything new in the last few days; rather focus on revising whatever you have done so far. Relax completely on the last day before the exam.•Take the GRE and blow it away!","As far as your your efforts are concerned, these are commendable that you want to chase the score and aspiring to get it more. At this juncture you are suggested to do some change in the preparation strategy. Here are some of the common mistake to avoid while preparing for GRE and during the test -Don’t scrimp on study materials - Just go though an ideal material such as - books, notes etc. Never read the books in jiffy. Give more attention and concentration to the what are you studying. Purchase some ideal books for the well structured preparation.Take GRE Practice Tests every weekend - Every often just appear for the sample practice test. Many people save practice tests for last 10 days before exam. I do not recommend this strategy, instead I advise you to do practice tests every weekend since it helps you to identify your weak areas, so you can concentrate more on them and subsequently find out the remedy.Do not underestimate quantitative section of New GRE - GMAT - math is not tough but challenging, so don't take it for granted. Just go through NCERT books for the conceptual clarity and then to the ideal practice book for GMAT. Then only you could be able to it more properly. Please do not make a mistake of underestimating quantitative section. Many of us are of impression that getting through quants section is just a cake walk (even I was under the same impression). Remember GRE math isn’t hard but it’s tricky. Without enough practice and proper strategies it can turn out to be a major score bummer. Quants is the scoring part of GRE and ideally Indians are considered good at math so with enough practice it can boost up our score.Verbal section is not just about vocabulary it is more than that - you can’t crack verbal section of GRE just by learning words, however that doesn’t mean vocab is useless. You need vocabulary for Text completion and Sentence equivalence. As ETS states emphasis on vocab is reduced and I experienced this as a trainer. Please note that 50% of question in verbal were from RC’s where vocab doesn’t help you much. Even in sentence Equivalence and Text Completion, you have to focus on nuances in sentences and learn to work in context. Just to say, there are many who memorized 5000 word list and scored less than 145.No last minute preparation- Never keep the preparation pending for the last moment. Always be up to the mark. Be prepared for the test thoroughly.Best of luck..!!","The GRE is an intriguing test, mystifying to many. Often we find students getting complacent that it is easy to crack without much training and a popular misconception is that only the Verbal section could be a challenge to work towards. However, the reality is quite contrary. Along with Verbal, students, in spite of a strong potential fail to get close to a 170 in Quant, and often end up in the low 160’s. In verbal often students end up around 150’s with a resultant total of 310. But you can score high, and remember higher the score, the better the universities where you can apply and higher the chances of admit and even scholarships!Here are few Tips to increase GRE scores-Target your dream school, not your dream GRE score, and work backward.Consistent practice. Getting higher GRE score is not difficult; with proper coaching and consistent practice, high GRE score is possible.Know your concepts wellKeep a track on your speedHow to Crack the GRE QuantThe test is tricky and section adaptive. Students often fail to identify the traps and end up marking the wrong answer. Constant practice will train you to avoid such traps and think quickly. The main hurdle on the test is speed. If you know the concepts that you are tested on well, you can go through the major part of the test quickly with a minute per question. This gives you enough time to solve the tougher questions, especially the Data Interpretation questions which will typically take more than 2 minutes per question.Understand, what is judged is your analytical capability, and not just your mathematical knowledge.Here is one example to help you understand-Column A: Number of factors of 100Column B: Number of factors of 441.Is A > B; B > A; A=B or cannot be determined.The concept requires you to prime factorize i.e. 100 = 22 * 52 and 441 = 32*72. The number of factors of each thus is 3 * 3 = 9 factors (using rule of counting). Thus the two columns are equal. If you know this concept you can do the question quickly. There are many such concepts in each of the main topics namely, Numbers, Statistics, Geometry, Coordinate Geometry, Sets, Speed Time Distance, Work Rate time, Counting and Probability. Knowing these concepts ensures you are fast in the test. Remember to always practice in sets of 20 questions, and time yourself - 35 minutes for a set of 20 Questions for Quant and 30 minutes for a set of 20 Questions for Verbal.How to crack GRE VerbalIn the Verbal section, students tend to memorize words in isolation and that is a foolproof way of practicing for failure in the actual test of Sentence Completion and Sentence Equivalence. In the older version of GRE, students were tested on synonyms and antonym questions and at that time rote memorization used to be helpful. But in the new GRE, you need to have knowledge of words in the context of sentences. In most of the tough questions the words are not that difficult; however, the meaning of the sentence and the connections between the blanks is tough to comprehend. One needs to practice and develop the skill of drawing meaning of the sentences from the clue words and transition words and predicting answers of the blanks.When building your vocabulary, try to understand words rather than memorize. Also, make sentences of your own which will make the meaning of the word stick in your memory. For example, consider the word ‘anachronism’. An easy way to understand this word is to break it as ana + chron + ism. This allows you to see that the root is ‘chron’. We know that chronology means pertaining to time. Thus this word must be related to time. ‘Ana’ is a prefix which means ‘out of’. Thus anachronism must be something which is out of chronological time. Now to easily remember this word make a sentence – for example, ‘Sword is an anachronism in modern warfare’. Ice the cake by writing down a few synonyms of the words. If you learn in this way not only will you understand the usage of words but it will be very helpful in Sentence Equivalence where you need to find two words which have similar meanings.Lastly, let’s address the most challenging section, Reading Comprehension. There are many strategies to handle RCs and you need to use the strategy that works for you. For most, the strategy which works best is to scan quickly the first time, understand the main idea of the passage and each paragraph, rather than the details. You can then go to the questions and start reading the specific details of the passage pertaining to each question.Last but not least, the most important thing to remember in order to increase your GRE score is to write a lot of genuine tests and analyze your mistakes carefully. Try and find out what kinds of mistakes are recurring. Are you getting caught in traps? Did you make any concept mistakes? Did you make reading and understanding errors? This analysis is the key to high scores.A little tip on improving AWA score.Remember, if you fail to prepare, you are preparing to fail!Good Luck…"
GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It's ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!You could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your termsKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms","It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.You’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.You’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.You have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it. You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door. But, remember ‘freelancing job is also an actual job’. There’s nothing fancy about it until you make it.Before you are a freelancer you should prepare for being one. These is a simple road-map which you need to follow with determination, to make through this challenge.ACQUIRING SKILLS:This is the most important part. You need to acquire skills in whatever field you choose. You may find this boring and have an urge to jump over and look up to the offers. You may have misconceptions of having all necessary skills. But, this is the only way you can be successful in long run.Take a break to start an elaborated research in the chosen field and the specializations they demand.Look out for dummy projects to build a great portfolio. Offer to work with your peers, friends and nonprofit organizations for free.Keep a close look at people already in the industry and look up to their work. Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.MANAGING NETWORKSLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.Now that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.BEING THE BRANDThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.You need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help. Get your business cards and be ready to talk about the work you do and yourself more often.Learn some basic marketing and accounting skills. Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.THE ADVENTURE RIDENow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!Start looking out for jobs. This might be a slow-moving process, instead of getting stressed introspect your offers.At first work on project/job expecting limited or no money at all. This is to just make connection sharpening your skills and showcasing your talent.

In the long run, you can either be choosy about your project or take projects in volumes, both are keys to success. With time, you’ll be able to create a Brand which clients and businesses will look up to.Finally, keep up the good work and regularly meet other freelancers, talk them about your business. Use calling more often than emailing to a client. These things will give your brand a personal touch and also avoid the feeling of isolation.

The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.This answer is a part of my blog, read it here.If you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.Please do let me know your suggestions and feedback.I’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.","For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.That doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.But I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.For example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”To that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.Of course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.Here are a few:You learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.There are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.It’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.You get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?Freelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.Bottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.And you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.If you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.On the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.Once you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.","Let’s start step by step:1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.If you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:Freelancer - Hire & Find JobsUpworkCraigslistPeoplePerHour99designsGuruEngineerBabuHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.2. Build a Perfect websiteAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.While building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.Show diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.Include your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.If you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.3. Brand YourselfOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-Whether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.Along with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.Your logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.Most importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.The domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.Become a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.4. Understand the project requirement carefullyAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.The only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.9. Be ProfessionalWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-Starting date of projectThe project’s deadlineMilestonesFunctionalitiesSchedule meeting in priorMake the clear timeline of deliverables.Professionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–Keep Your Personal Life limited to yourselfYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.  It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.Charge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.Schedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.If some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.Build the right association.It is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.Follow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.Don’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.Be positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.10. Networking and Relationship with ClientsBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..Some useful techniques to grow your network.1. Increase your Social Media Network  Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.  2. Attend events You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.3. Speak at events Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event. 4.

GRE,What should be the target GRE score for Stanford MS&E?,https://www.quora.com//What-should-be-the-target-GRE-score-for-Stanford-MS-E,"Stanford Management Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions",11,"To put it straight, a 340 wouldn’t guarantee your admission unless your profile as a whole, your undergrad GPA, your statement of purpose and your letters of recommendations put you as a good candidate. A low GRE score would hurt you as in you might not make through the first round even as it is ground for a rejection. But beyond 325, with a close to 170 on quants won't buy you any more leverage. A 328 vs 335 hardly would make any difference unless a person with the exactly the same profile as yours out scored you on GRE.So, to put it in summary, beyond a decent score of 325 it won’t buy you any leverage while a low score in the <320 category is going to hurt you. Beyond 325, it’s going to be a mere check park on your profile that you took the GRE. As others have pointed out, it’s the last factor which is going to make a difference and is more of a rejection criterion rather than getting you extra brownie points.","Thanks for A2A.Stanford University is one of the best universities in the world with its rich faculty base,strong alumni network, placements and most importantly a global exposure. Although GRE score is just an examination that allows you to apply to universities abroad. Having said that if you have a score of 330–335 it will be safe to apply to this university for MS. I will suggest you to have decent LORs and SOPs along with it so that your chances of selection increase. If you have prior research and publication experience it will help you to convince the professors to allow you for assistantships. Relevant work experience is icing on the cake !!However, does that mean with a GRE score within 320–330 won’t fetch you this admit? Of course not. You can still get into Stanford with a score above 320 if you have decent academics as well as if you succeed in convincing them through your SOPs.Also, one more suggestion please try working on building your profile based on relevant field. After all it’s Stanford !! Make your every move count. Try to contact the professors there so that you have a better chance of getting research assistantship.Hope you get the desired admit. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need any further information.Cheers!!-Kush..","This is a very good question. It is very essential to understand the Target GRE score for Stanford MS&E. Stanford University is among the Top 10 Universities in the US. So you can imagine the acceptance rate. They would not just take an average student. Their acceptance rate is mere 4.8% and financial aids are among the most generous ones. To get an idea of exactly how competitive Stanford is, you don’t have to look further than the long list of prominent companies founded by Stanford alumni- Google, Hewlett-Packard, LinkedIn, Yahoo, and Sun Microsystems. And that’s not even one-tenth of the list.Mentioned below are Average required scores for MS&E in Stanford:Average Quant-166Average Verbal-160Average GRE-Anything above 330. A helpful link for GRE prep-Best Books For GRE Test Prep | YocketHowever, This is a world-class university so they do not only focus on GRE but many other parameters in a students profile.GRE is definitely a very important parameter, but your profile should be highly commendable to get an admit in Stanford University.Good Luck!","It was quite some time ago, but I scored a 720 and 590, which I think equate to a 168 and 159 on the current scale. I got into Stanford’s ME Dept. with a Nuclear Engineering emphasis, and was awarded an Atomic Energy Commission Fellowship for my Masters studies.My understanding is the Stanford Engineering does not place high emphasis on the GRE. They want applicants to take it to demonstrate they are serious about attending grad school. I may be incorrect on this point, and I would like others to weigh in, and say if I am wrong about this or if they agree.In any event, the GRE is probably the least important metric for admission to the graduate school. Having said that, if you are much lower than some of the benchmarks that others have provided, I imagine it can very easily result in your rejection.I also would take my input with a grain of salt because I expect it is far more competitive and difficult to get into Stanford’s Engineering Graduate Schools now, than it was in the 70’s!!"
GRE,"What minimum and recommended GPA, GRE and TOEFL score an Indian student not from IIT should have to get MS CS a MIT,Harvard, Stanford, UCB or CMU?",https://www.quora.com//What-minimum-and-recommended-GPA-GRE-and-TOEFL-score-an-Indian-student-not-from-IIT-should-have-to-get-MS-CS-a-MIT-Harvard-Stanford-UCB-or-CMU,"Master's Programs in Computer Science Admissions and the Graduate Record Examination, Harvard University vs. Stanford University, Graduate School Admissions and the TOEFL, Master's Programs and the Graduate Record Examination, Carnegie Mellon University, University of California, Berkeley, Master's Programs in the United States of America, TOEFL, Stanford University, Harvard University, Master of Science in Computer Science, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Computer Science Education, Master's Programs",6,"Thanks for A2A!MIT, Harvard, Stanford, UCB, CMU are all top top universities and your profile has to be significantly good to secure an admission into these universities,GRE - 325+ on the safer sideTOEFL - 110+GPA - Be in the top 2-5% of your class Research - Do as many publications as you can, try to get involved in research activities at college, try to get patents if possible.Internships - I sincerely believe internships play a considerable role! Use your vacation time for internships and try to focus on research based roles/ Pure CS roles.Extra Curricular - Present Papers, Attend events such as GSOC, other coding events etcProjects - Do at least 2+ projects during your under graduation, better if they are industry related.Work Experience - An optional factor, but may prove worthy if you work in the R&D of a top product company for a few years.SOP - A very crucial factor, put a lot of time and effort into this and make sure it reflects your motives behind pursuing MS CS at its best.LORs - Get Letters of Recommendation from research people at college, top management at work (They have to know you!)Even if you cover all the above points, there is no guarantee that you'd make into one of the universities you have mentioned above. A combination of all these factors come into play when your decision is being made, but these 10 points are a good first step to start with.I know someone with a 1400+/1600 GRE and made into MIT, UCB, CMU for MS/PhD. He had a stellar profile with consistent 9+ GPA at college,  2 years research in Microsoft R&D and had a couple of patents when he applied. So it's your overall profile that matters.Hope this answer helps! All the very best!","In general try being in the 90th percentile or higher in any of the tests. This is the best strategy! Once you are there, your scores become irrelevant but not before that. What this means is that scores and GPA are only used to filter out candidates in the first round, after that recommendation letters and other factors come in play. The above applies to anyone from any nationality or school.School reputation I believe becomes important once you pass the tests filter, but not before that, but even if you are not from a top school an excellent recommendation letter, extracurricular work to show or work experience can easily make up for it. Also if your GPA is not great, try to justify any special circumstances that may have adversely affected it or if it is just school tradition.I followed this advice and it got me into the PhD program in Computer Science at CMU and got into other top schools in the US. The above is basically a compilation of advice from many people I met over the years that were in graduate school at top universities.","We at ConnectBud interviewed a current student at CMU who has done “BTech in Computer Science from Lovely Professional University” and got this response“GRE score was 323.

GRE,"Apart from good GRE scores, what are the other credentials required to ensure admission to a top foreign university for an MS program?",https://www.quora.com//Apart-from-good-GRE-scores-what-are-the-other-credentials-required-to-ensure-admission-to-a-top-foreign-university-for-an-MS-program,"The GRE and Postgraduate University Admissions, Master's Programs and the Graduate Record Examination, Master's Programs Admissions, Master of Science in Computer Science, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Master of Science Degrees, Master's Programs, College and University Admissions, College Advice",41,"Note: You can follow my Quora blog for more info about higher education abroad: https://studyabroadgre.quora.com/SOP Evaluation here: SOP Evaluation procedure by Mihir on Study AbroadPS: Before I answer anything else, I will directly answer the question asked by most of the applicants: Can my GRE compensate for poor GPA/CGPA? The answer is NO. Now read everything below:GRE is not a big selection criterion for MS programs. The selection of a candidate for MS program is a 2 stage process:Screening process by the admin department: This screening process goes something like, there is a list of cut-off score or threshold values for certain selection criterion. For example, all students with GRE above 310 will be cleared, or all students with CGPA above 8.0/10.0 will be selected etc. This limit is not very strict and is flexible. TOEFL is one such criterion that will fall only and only in this screening process and not evaluated for the next one, unless you are going for TA/RA, in which case they need to evaluate your English language capability (still it will be least importance).Selection process by Adcom: In this process, you will be judged on your GPA, GRE score, SOP, LOR etc and is highly flexible. A student with great acads but not so good GRE can be selected over a student with perfect GRE score and average acads. It depends on your whole application file BUT certain parameters weigh more than the others.Usually the selection criterion goes like this (in descending order):Academic GPA/CGPA/%age as well as ranking in your batchUndergrad universitySOPResearch ex/Work exGRELORThese other factors will vary from case to case:Final Year ProjectInternship and papersCo/Extra-curricularProf LettingProblems people might face:BacklogsYear GapPlagiarismSome people may disagree, but this is what I personally think, seen and experienced.SELECTION CRITERION:1. Acads are the most important parameters:Your GPA or %age is the prime deciding factor. If you are topper in your batch and have shown outstanding academic performance, the chances are that you will be a preferable candidate for the program. Backlogs will damage your admission chances drastically. Although you can still find cases with a lot of backlogs and people still get admission in the university. Read this link at the end of the answer those who have low confidence in this area (he had 55 backlogs; read the whole thread/story).2. Undergrad University:If you belong to one of the top universities in your country, and you have descent acads, then you have good chances of admission. BEWARE, if you are from a top university BUT your acads are weak you will have a disadvantage compared to a student who is from a descent ranking university but high GPA. That's how it goes, 'Be on the top where ever you are', that's something to be learned not just for MS admission process but for life as well. :D3. Statement of Purpose (SOP):I personally feel that SOP is a big deciding factor in your admission. You can be a lot of different by writing an excellent SOP. Your SOP will say a lot of thing about you silently that a strong profile will never be able to speak out. SOP tells your attitude, your ambition, your clarity of thought and your personality. These sometime overweight excellent profiles. This video will help you realize the importance of a good SOP (UMass Amherst Admission Committee):Also if you want to read more about it, check the link at the end of the answer.4. Work/Research ex, GRE and LOR:I will prefer not to rank them in a strict order because they will depend on the type of program you are applying to. If you are applying for a research based program, your research/work ex and LOR will be of higher value than GRE, but if may be it is not a specifically research based MS program, then if is possible that GRE may matter more. A good GRE score will certainly help. Score above 310 is considered okay-okay.... may be descent... 320+ is desirable and good... 330+ is excellent. AWA also matters and 3.0+ is almost like mandatory... 4/4+ is good. Work/research ex is helpful not just during MS application process but also after completing your MS when job hunting. A relevant work ex is recommended and good, but if you have work ex in a different field than what you are going to study, no promises can be made if it will help.If you are interested in doing some research work and gain some research experience before applying for MS you can apply as RA at IITs under a prof. Here are some details on that: http://www.edulix.com/forum/show... LORs are important mainly for PhD programs. they do add some weight to the application, but only if a prominent professor from a premier institute or a high ranking official from work place writes it. It is also important to send the LOR only using the official university/company mail id of the prof/boss, else although acceptable, they will add ZERO points to application.Finally I will add the uncertainty factor: LUCK. :D Although they say ""The harder I work, the luckier I get.""Update: To include all the rest of the factors involved in the admission process.THESE FACTORS WILL VARY FROM CASE TO CASE:1. Final Year Project (FYP):Check this too: Mihir Gupta's answer to Which kind of project should I do so that I can show it in my resume for MS in US? This is also one of the important deciding factors for admission, especially for one applying for MS with thesis. It will demonstrate your ability to convert your theoretical know-how into practical engineering knowledge. Also if your project is good enough, you can get a paper out of it and publish it. Sometimes, if he admission process involves an interview with a prof who is willing to take you as RA/TA, then the FYP is very important as mos of the interview questions will be from the project.2. Internships and Papers:Internship that are usually undertaken by B.Tech students in 3rd or 4th year matter only if they project assigned to them is a good one and it they do it from a reputed firm like IISC, DRDO, or some big pvt companies. Here the important thing will also be to work for a longer time as one month's internship won't be of any use. If you work for a minimum 3 months and are also able to impress your boss such that he is willing to give you recommendation, that will be the best case scene. It is also possible to try score internships abroad in a university or a company. They are a big plus for overall profile.Research papers published during the final year project or internship will help those who wish to go for MS with thesis option but not very much for students aiming for MS without thesis (MEngg; 1 yr course). The impact factor of the journal you have published your work in will be considered, but not much as adcom do not expect a high quality research work from an undergrad unless it is a direct PhD application.3. Co/Extra-curricular:These activities will not offer you any major advantage, but will make your resume/CV look bright and show that you are involved in activities other than acads. If you do not have good acads and bad GRE, then these activities will be of zero importance, on the other hand if you profile is good and you have done some nice activities, then these will provide you an edge over student who has profile similar to yours.4. Prof-Letting:This is useful only when you think you have good admission chances and that you want to work under a prof as RA/TA under a prof during MS. For this the credentials responsible will differ. Of course acads will still hold importance, but after that will come your work ex, research ex, papers, project and LOR. There is a method required to contact profs of the desired university. You can read all about it in the link at the end of the answer.PROBLEMS PEOPLE MIGHT FACE:1. Backlogs:Don't feel disappointed if you have had a few backlogs. Although your list of universities will be a bit different compared to the one who had no backlogs, but you still do have a good chance to succeed. For this I will again link you to this guy who had 55 backlogs and still got admit and visa as well. All you need is strong motivation, hard work and will power.Backlog in a core subject, the one you are selecting your specialization for MS will hurt bad, but if it is in an unrelated subject, it will probably not be that bad.2. Year Gap:If you completed your UG in 2012 and did nothing till June 2013, then it will be called a year gap. If you worked for a major part of that year (6/6+ months) then its not probably not a year gap.Some year gaps are acceptable. Like you took a year off to work in an NGO or may be for (Teach For India) TFI or something like that, then it is acceptable.The other case may be that you were preparing for GATE or any other exam. This will be a negative factor for your profile unless you did great in that exam and that exam somehow added to your profile (like good GATE score is valuable for German universities).The third case can be that you were search for job and by the end you decided to take GRE for MS. This will have really bad effect on your profile, unless you can cover it with something valuable you might have done side by side.3. Plagiarism:This is kind of an indirect factor that may affect your chances of admit, BUT if found guilty, you may not just receive reject from the university you applied to but also from other universities you are going to apply to. Plagiarism is a serious issue when it comes to higher studies.

More importantly, once you achieve something around 167 and above in quant and 160 and above in Verbal, even GRE does not matter. These days a lot of Indian students are applying with GRE scores of 325+, so I do not think GRE will pull you up, unless you get 335+ (but anything less than 315 will pull you down).What matters --1) CGPA (higher the CGPA better are your chances. Anything with 9 pointer above will be a good bet).2) Rank (if your university of college gives you a recognised rank then say your CGPA is 8, but still you are second in class, then it shall help your case).3) Name of the institute. Better recongized is your institute, better are your chances. For example: names such as IIT, NIT or BITS do hold value.4) Internships -- If you have internship at IIT or some other good US university, then you have brighter chances of achieving an admission. If you have internships at top multinationals (such as for CS guys microsoft, IBM labs, intel, samsung and so on) then also you can secure a good MS program. Your internship at a startup can also help you, if the work done is good. The main point to understand is at the end of the day, work matters.5) If you have research papers or some academic awards or grants, then it will help you pass through a good MS program. Publishing researh papers does not mean that a person publishes 10 papers, but the conference or journal is not even recognized. Even if you have a single paper, but from a reputed organization, then it is far better than ten.6) Contacts with foreign univeristy profesor. If you have any interaction with the professor of the college of your choice, then you have an edge.7) SOP -- A golden rule, write the truth and not stories. State your achivements and your study plans, group to join and professor to work with.PS: Thanx to Nikhil Prabhu for edits","Dear GRE aspirant,Do you think that modest GRE scores and backlogs would hold back a profile? No, definitely not.To help you in understanding this claim better, I have a chart* with three GREedge alumni with modest GRE scores and backlogs.*Data obtained from GREedge’s Admission Counselling TeamSo, these profiles are indeed testimony to the fact that apart from your GRE score, a host of other factors determine the status of your admits. Now that you know this, I’m sure you are wondering what these factors are. Based on my experience as the Co-founder of GREedge, I would like to share them with you.Before you get to these factors, you must know the application process to know how universities shortlist candidates. This would give you a background of what universities look for in a prospective candidate. A general flow of the application process would look like this:Over the evaluation process, Universities, in general, look to scrutinize you on a holistic basis.The evaluation begins by examining your CGPA and a host of other factors. Some of these factors include the scores of your admission requirement tests, Letter of Recommendation, Statement of Purpose/essay among the rest. So, clearly understand what universities use as a sieve in screening your application.Most universities have some common filters. Some of them include:Competitive GPA: Once your application package reaches the university, it is immediately forwarded to the Graduate Department. The first scrutiny that is made on the application is the “test of your GPA”. Your GPA speaks volumes about your application. If you are a rank-holder or if you have a consistent academic track record, then you can definitely expect some weightage. Countries like the U.S. and Germany place a huge emphasis on GPAs. For example, Georgia Tech requires an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better to pursue a Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (MS-HCI). Though you cannot completely balance your profile with high GPA, a consistent and competitive GPA will definitely add substantial value to your profile. In addition to your GPA, the following academic factors will give your application an edge too.TOEFL/IELTS: A great deal of emphasis is placed on your IELTS or TOEFL score apart from your GRE score. Most universities require a good TOEFL or IELTS score. For example, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, requires a minimum of 90 points in the Internet-based TOEFL (iBT). Georgia Tech, on the other hand, for the MS-HCI program, requires a minimum of 100 in TOEFL. Universities emphasize on TOEFL/IELTS scores to determine the status of TA/RA. Further, IELTS and TOEFL scores are also taken into account in determining the quantum of your scholarships and fellowships. Keep it a point to research on the minimum requirements. A TOEFL score over 100 or IELTS score over 7 will indeed add value to your profile.Letter of Recommendation: The basic purpose of the Letter of Recommendation is to get a person to vouch for your credentials. This, no doubt, adds value to your profile. Ensure that you get two or three Letters of Recommendation. The Letter of Recommendation must come from someone who has been associated with you. It can be your university professor or your senior at workplace. Further, it will also add value if the person who recommends you has a PhD. So, make it a point to get a commendable Letter of Recommendation and this will indeed boost the value of your profile.Statement of Purpose: Your SOP is just like your personal interview with the Admission Committee. Convey all that you want the Admission Committee to know about your profile.Your Statement of Purpose must be genuine and convincing. Make it a point to highlight the drive behind your Master’s program. Answer all possible questions, such as:1. Your degree of interest in your chosen field 2. What made you apply for the particular university 3. Why did you choose the particular courseEnsure that you don’t leave out any relevant information. Make it a point to highlight all your academic achievements and professional goals. Always remember that your SOP is as good as an interview. So, draft a compelling SOP that would persuade the Admission Committee to consider your profile.You can keep the following guidelines in your mind while you draft your SOP:Paper Publication and Research Work: Having a good number of paper publications and research work will show that you had been in touch with the academic community. Ensure that you have your papers published in international journals. Also, if you had participated in international conferences, ensure that you highlight them. A good number of paper publications and research work will indeed add points to your applications. So, even if you have not published any papers until now, get started with it. Paper publications and research work add a high impact to your profile.Work Experience: Work experience will be a crucial factor in adding value to your profile. Two or three years of relevant experience will add precious points to your profile. Further, it will also be a good source for your Letter of Recommendation. Though work experience is not a mandatory requirement, relevant work experience in a reputed company will add value.Project and Internships: Your project and internships will definitely be considered while your application is evaluated. The degree of your practical knowledge and research acumen can be demonstrated through projects and internships. So, highlight your projects and internships. Make it a point to highlight your projects and internships in an appropriate manner.Apart from these factors, you can certainly highlight your co-curricular and extracurricular activities too. They will also be considered since they throw light on your overall personality.Though there is no set order of priority in evaluating a candidate’s profile, you can indeed make a huge impact if you can balance out your profile. So, have a balanced profile and try not to compromise on any element. Remember that universities look for candidates with a holistic profile and not someone with unilateral strength. This will indeed make all the difference.All the best!","Studying abroad: it’s something we all have dreamt about at some point, isn’t it? The prospect of moving to a strange country, meeting new friends and living independently cannot fail to excite anyone. It really comes as no surprise, then, that the Ministry of External Affairs reported that as many as 7.5 lakh Indian students are studying abroad in 2018, with the numbers only predicted to rise in the coming years.With the US and Canada retaining top spots as the preferred study abroad destinations, (with 2.1 lakh and 1 lakh Indian students respectively) it goes without saying, then, that the competition for seats at universities in these two countries can get incredibly stiff.eBook Download: USA or Canada - What’s the right choice for MSAdd to that the high costs of application fees, and it becomes paramount to ensure that your application quality is top-notch and helps you put your best foot forward.

Here’s a glimpse at some of the top Canadian universities that accept GRE scores, and their respective GRE requirements:Download the ebook GRE Cutoff Scores for Top 35 UniversitiesTOEFL/IELTS score: Both the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) are accepted at universities in Canada, Germany and the US, and seek to assess your command and fluency over the English language. Your ability to read, write, speak and listen comfortably in English will be gauged, and a score will be given accordingly. In countries apart from USA, this lays a very important role in the admission committee’s mind as it gives a reflection of your communication abilities. In the TOEFL iBT (Internet Based Test), each of the four sections will be marked between 0 to 30 for a possible total score of 120. On the IELTS, marks are allotted between 0 to 9, with 0.5 increments. You will be given an individual band score for each skill, in addition to an overall score. A good TOEFL score is anything between 100 to 120, while a score of 7.5 and above is generally regarded as a good IELTS score. While the IELTS enjoys a worldwide acceptance, the TOEFL is generally used in the US, although all American universities also accept IELTS scores. Owing to its versatility, IELTS scores are valid in over 10,000 institutions and universities worldwide, including countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany.Download eBook: A Definitive Guide for IELTS hereAcademic GPA: One of the most crucial factors that impact your admission chances would be your GPA referred to as CGPA or percentages in a lot of Indian Institutions. Given the fact that a student’s CGPA does not completely reflect the student’s potential but to a certain extent about the faculty, college & competition in the university, it’s seen as a relative criterion. To explain in simple words, your GPA is considered as good or bad depending on your topper’s GPA. Also, each country requires your to convert your GPA to scale of 4. Read about how to convert your GPA for USA, Canada & Germany here>>Statement of Purpose: The Statement of Purpose, or the SOP, is a crucial ingredient to a successful application. Because universities abroad typically receive hundreds of applications with similar credentials, your SOP is your one chance to showcase your individuality and your dreams and aspirations, and set yourself apart from your peers. The SOP is commonly thought to be a replacement for the personal interview, and for that reason, it is crucial that you nail it just right. For the lowdown on how to craft the perfect winning SOP, make sure you checkout our top tips and tricks!Download ebook: How To Craft A Winning SOP >>Letters of Recommendation: Written by former professors or employers, the LOR is an important testament to your intellectual and personal character, and is essentially a promise from one professor to another that you are an intelligent, diligent student, and deserving of an admit. Ideally, you should get LORs from professors who have supervised your thesis or research project, Heads of Departments, or from professors who have taught you and known you for a substantial period of time, especially if they are well-known in their field and have published extensively. You can also submit LORs from employers, although it is recommended you only do this if you’ve been out of college for a few years.Work and research experience: As a fresh undergraduate, you aren’t typically expected to have work experience apart from the usual internship or voluntary work. However, if you do have such experience, make sure to highlight it in your CV and SOP. Most applicants tend to apply to graduate school straight after finishing undergrad, and view work experience as a filler, but work experience not only allows you to gain a fresh perspective on the world, but also facilitates the development of new, life-defining skills, and the ability to work in and lead diverse groups of people, all of which are paramount to graduate applications. As far as research is concerned, do remember, universities in the US are vastly different from Indian ones, especially because of the onus they place on research and development, to the extent where applicants with a relatively lower GPA have won admits to top schools based purely on their excellent research experience in the past. If you have substantial research experience, it would be a good idea to get your research supervisors to write you a reference letter, and also issue you any relevant certificates. Both research and work experience are especially beneficial in making up for any shortfalls in you GPA or GRE scores, and also in getting scholarships and other aid.What are the common mistakes students make while applying?Time, as they say, is money, and this is especially true for MS applications, where every single day is of prime importance. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that you plan your application well in advance and follow a proper timeline so that you don’t find yourself floundering for time. So what are some of the mistakes that trip up study abroad aspirants? Let’s take a look:Starting GRE preparation late: Your GRE, as we mentioned, is one of the most important building blocks of your application, so ideally, you must give yourself sufficient time to start preparing for the test, so you can identify your weak points and work on them properly. You also need to have enough time so that if you find your GRE scores unsatisfactory, you can choose to rewrite it.Inability to shortlist universities: Of course, Harvard, MIT and Caltech are the dream of millions, but realistically, is your profile compatible with the stringent requirements of these universities? Before applying, draw up a list of 8-10 universities you would like to attend, based on criteria such as GRE requirements, tuition fee, acceptance rate, past admits, alum profiles, cultural & research field compatibility with faculty etc. Remember, you will be spending quite a bit on application fees, so make sure you don’t waste time and money on schools that are unrealistically out of your league.Download The SELECT Strategy to Shortlist Universities eBOOK hereLacking the relevant details about deadlines and requirements: Universities in the US and Canada are extremely strict about the application deadlines: for instance, for fall admit, applications usually close in the first week of December of the previous year. Many aspirants often fail to take cognizance of deadlines, or neglect to send in their applications keeping in mind the time it would take to reach the US. A good idea is to note down the application deadlines of the various programs you want to apply to, well in advance. Do remember that if you are applying for a scholarship, deadlines are typically earlier. Additionally, many schools have an early bird round, which closes much before the usual deadlines. Applying in an early bird round greatly improves your chances at an offer letter, so if you’re ready, you can send in your applications right in time for that!Consulting unofficial/inaccurate/random websites: The internet is a quagmire of information, and it is easy to fall into a trap of misinformation if you are not careful. While researching for application information, be sure to stick to only the university’s official websites. If you are still doubtful or have any questions, be sure to write to the admissions help desk of the university to be sure.Sending an incomplete or inadequate application: Applying overseas is not as straightforward as applying to universities in India: there is a lot more paperwork involved, such as healthcare insurance, transcripts, and visas, and in order to prevent your application from being summarily rejected, you need to ensure that your application package is complete. Overwhelmed?Don’t worry. Please find the MS application checklist right below to help you plan your entire application process.Download the eBOOK “MS Admit: The Application Checklist” hereWe hope you found this information useful, and now have some clarity on the various building blocks to ensuring an offer letter to your dream university.

GRE,I am a BTech (CSE) graduate from India (Gujarat). How do I apply for an MS program in the USA?,https://www.quora.com//I-am-a-BTech-CSE-graduate-from-India-Gujarat-How-do-I-apply-for-an-MS-program-in-the-USA,"TOEFEL, Masters in Computer Science in the United States, Master of Science Degrees in the United States, International English Language Testing System (IELTS), Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",13,"I would point out some of the things that you need to work on the most while applying in the US, Also you can refer to the answers already given here and get the most info you can.1. A good CGPA or percentage in your Undergraduate: As we all must know that the GRE does not have subject specific test and hence your CGPA is the only thing that reflects your knowledge in a particular subject. (This might be overlooked if you do your masters from your home country or you have been working after completing your graduate school)  2. High GRE score. A score of 325+ is required in order secure admission into a top college. Your GRE score reflects your aptitude and command on English knowledge that is very vital to survive in a cut throat competition.  3. High TOEFL score. A TOEFL score of 100+ is considered very decent, and can easily get you into a top 20 college in the US. Your TOEFL score might also get you fellowship and scholarship. (More info in provided in the coming sections).  4. Internship/Job Experience.   If you are applying in a US university directly after your graduation then you must have decent amount of internship certificates. Recently I read a study in Economics Times regarding how Ivy league colleges are providing special acknowledgement to those who have had working experience in a start up (Does not matter if it was successful or not). I would suggest you to get as much internship as you can in MNC/NGO/Start-Up.  If you have already passed out your graduate school and currently working then I would suggest you to get minimum of 2 years of experience. But if you have been working in a company for 7-8 years then your chances to get into these universities get a bit low, as with age people to tend to be rigid and are a bit difficult to train.  5. Recommendation letter and Statement of purpose: These are only viewed by the college you applied in once you have impressed them by your CV and academics.   Many people tend to copy their SOP or get it written by someone else. It is very important to understand that all top universities have their interview rounds and they might ask you about your SOP, and it is better to write your SOP on your own rather than getting embarrassed in front of your professors. Writing your SOP is really easy, all you need to do is tell them why you want to join a particular university, trust me the more truthful you are the better it reflects to them.  Moving onto the Letter of recommendation part, this is more like a certification from your seniors (At Workplace), Professors from your regular college and Professors from any summer/winter school you attended. I wouldn’t go into detail for this section as it is really easy to get a letter of recommendation in countries like India etc.PS: Application in US universities start way in advance, like a year in advance and hence you should be ready with all the documents ASAP.But if you dont have the most important credential that is the GRE score, then please consider delaying your application. Now there is a general myth surrounding the whole application process is that people fail to get their educational visa on time, This is one of the most irritating question people have for me. The visa process is made to understand the purpose of the trip and if you are no shady, they want to send you to America and not stop you from going there. Just be honest with them and you will be just fine. the interview will last not longer than a minute or 2 and its that simple. I will never know why people involve middleman for this very reason, thats just over complicating and is a process where you will waste a lot of money.Make sure to check out our app VOLT on Google play store. It now has over 1.1 lakh downloads and has amazing cool features that will make your verbal section easy and interestingVoLT: Vocabulary Learning Technique , helps student prepare for Verbal and Vocabulary section of competitive exam.Link for download VoLT - Vocabulary Learning - Android Apps on Google Play","Start your preparation by at least 18 months earlier to your intended semester. You can follow these steps:Take a sample GRE test (Most preferably power prep I). If you score a total of 300 for example, then you can guess your final score to be in between 315-320.Then analyze your profile (take a note of all research papers you published, going to publish and project work).Go through the similar profiles in Stupidsid.com or Edulix and short some universities (around 4 univs).Then start preparing for GRE and make sure you reach your target of 315. After the exam is done, select the 4 universities you shortlisted for Educational Testing Service (ETS) to report your scores to (by this way of selecting universities beforehand, you can save $100 here).Apply for TOEFL or International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and prepare to get the minimum score required by your department in the universities selected. (with TOEFL of IELTS – British Council you can save $72 by selecting universities beforehand)After you are done with these exams, start preparing your SOP. At the same time, reach out to your professors asking for recommendation letters. Help them prepare recommendation letters on your behalf. Also get the required no.of sets of transcripts from your university.Once you are okay with SOP and required LORs, open the university website and fill out the online application. After completing this application, you'll be required to upload scanned copies of mark sheets.Complete the online application, pay the application fee, wait for university to send a mail with student id and finally courier the transcripts to those universities (Make sure you mention your student id on top of the cover).Wait for university to mail its decision.If accepted, they'll ask you to send bank statement showing liquid assets amounting to 1 year of expenses you are going to spend in that university along with affidavit of support (link to this affidavit will be sent to you in the acceptance mail) and also they'll ask you to get some vaccinations done.After approving your bank statement, they'll send you the I20.On receiving I20, pay your SEVIS fee and apply for F-1 Student Visas (US).Once your visa is approved, you are free to go.I guess, I have covered all the steps here. If needed further clarifications, you are free to pm me.All the Best.Edit1: sorry guys your have to start your preparation before 18 months, not 1 year.","I'm quite surprised to see that nobody has mentioned about getting an Education Consultant (an unpaid and official one ofcourse), in the answers. I myself have been searching a lot lately and found out a lot of things. Personally, I feel that it's best to search on your own because there are very few people who actually tell you about - Education USA (may be they themselves don't know about it). http://www.usief.org.in/New-Delh...Visit their office and talk to them about your interests. They'll guide you better. Certainly you won't be able to do everything by yourself. We all definitely need support and help especially with writing SOP(s).Other answers are helpful in some or the other way but we cannot do everything just by reading Quora answers. Not everyone can. Also, you definitely don't need to hire a paid consultant for USA. Checkout YouTube videos. Videos are more helpful. There is this guy with a YouTube channel named ""That Indian Guy"".He has made a lot of videos for people planning to go to the US for higher studies. All the best!","Follow these steps. Start ahead of time. Don’t wait till last minute. There’s a lot to be done.Evaluate your profile. What are your strengths, your weaknesses.Determine your long term and short term goals. Long term is where will you want to be in 7–10 years, short term is immediately after graduation.Start studying for the standardization exams. SAT for Undergrad, GRE for Grad school. You may need to take the TOEFL as well.Take a test prep exam. This will give you a good indication of where you stand and what you should expect on the real exam scores.Based on your goals, grades, GRE scores, research which universities are applicable to you. Break them down into three categories: Out of reach (20–30% chance of making it in), medium (60–70% of making it) and easy (100% chance of making) - pick out 3 in each category for now.Start developing a list of 5 recommenders. These are people who you are comfortable with, who know your work, your class work, your research etc.Take your standardized test. Study harder and re-take if you’re unhappy with the scores.With the list of universities at hand, start an in depth research into the program you will be applying to. This will help in writing your SOP.Start writing your SOP for one university. Write about what your goals are, long term and short term; write about how the university will help you achieve these goals; and how the university is a good fit for you. But like with any service in this world, it has to be mutually beneficial to both sides. So then talk about how the university benefits by having a candidate like you - by showing what you bring to the table and how, once you graduate, you will be a good brand ambassador for that university and program. If you’re applying to a research program, pick out which professor you would like to work with and write about joining his research group with a particular set of skills you possess. Write about a research idea you have and would like to work on; even if it may not be practical at this point in time. Put your ideas out there, the professor will be impressed that you have thought about his research in depth and will want to work with a student like you.Reach out to the top 3 out of 5 recommenders. Create your resume and give it to them. Talk to each one of them about what aspects of your resume you would like them to focus on. This will cover a wide variety of your skills, personality, work ethic etc.Put the whole application together. Review your SOP and let a few other close friends, family or professors review it as well. Politely remind your recommenders the deadline is approaching.Submit, sit back and relax. You’ve done it. You’re on your way to fulfilling your goals!I have created a detailed schedule for each task, which will serve as a great checklist for everything. Feel free to use it to make sure that your application gets submitted on time.Good luck!"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5.

GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,What is the best method to memorize GRE Word list?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-the-best-method-to-memorize-GRE-Word-list,"Memorization, Memory (information storage), Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",43,"Many GRE experts say that you don't need to learn the exhaustive word-list in the new GRE format. Well it's true that you won't encounter many words out of the ""high frequency word-lists"" on your D-Day. For example, in most of the sentence equivalence questions, your answer will be the pair of words, among which, one is a general word and another one is a High Frequency GRE word. Say, ""support"" and ""bolster"". But ETS doesn't provide you any such word-list. Many words in one High Frequency Word List won't be on another list. The truth is, learning 2000-3000 words can give you an extra edge and you can score at least 5 more marks in your verbal section. Not only this. The good thing about learning new words is the fact that this is the only part of your GRE Test which is going to help you in the long run. Suppose you learned a word yesterday and you encounter that word while reading today's newspaper. The bliss it brings is just amazing. Your frequency to check for a word meaning in a dictionary will reduce by nearly 60%. Improving your vocabulary is really a good thing. And the GRE Test is the best excuse to achieve it. Don't take it as a burden. Take it as an opportunity.Okay, I am sorry I digressed from the main question. The best method to memorize GRE Words is to make FLASH CARDS and REVISE REVISE and REVISE. Pick a wordlist and aim to learn 50 words per day. On the next day, before learning the next 50 words, revise what you learned yesterday and make Flash Cards for those words which you don't remember. Also make flashcards of those words which you think you'll probably forget in the future. Don't learn new words on Sunday. Revise all the words you've learned till date from your flashcards.If you don't revise on a weekly basis, most likely you'll forget most of the new words within two weeks.Ankit Sharma's answer to Which is the best word list?Good Luck.","As enlisted in above answers, contextual way of learning of words are better than mugging up for a longer run.But how do we do that?Reading books and newspaper articles,watching movies or engaging in conversations which gives you a proper context to use words.But all these methods takes like forever to learn all the words.Our main concern is how to remember words easily within a shorter duration.How to build your GRE vocabulary in a short span of time?At the same time we can’t overload our brain with words. So how do we learn the words?1. Learn GRE words with pictures-Images help you define words in a meaningful context. They enable you to understand and utilize vocabulary in different aspects of life. In addition, they help you remember the words every time you see the object.Here is how to learn GRE words using pictures and a video on how to use CV Flashcards which you can buy from Amazon.2. Learn Vocabulary for GRE through Word Roots-Root Root words are the basic words to which affixes (prefixes and suffixes) are added to form the new word.Focusing on your test prep time on root words in addition to learning individual word can save your time,energy and improve your score is possible you will see words you do not know.Therefore,knowing the roots may help you get a sense of the general meaning of certain words3. Learn Theme based GRE Words-Your brain loves to make connections between things. So when you’re sad, and it’s raining, there’s a little part of you that feels like maybe your sadness is so heart-wrenchingly profound that you actually altered the weather.Or when you can see a leaf fall from a tree and suddenly get crystal-clear, long-forgotten flashbacks to your first day raking leaves, or visiting the mountains.When you see a leaf, your brain does this:So you can take up a theme and learn around 10 words associating it.Becomes much easier!!These are just a few points but you can check out this blog on - A detailed approach on how to learn vocabulary the points mentioned are really useful and will help you remember GRE words more easily.","It's a great way to start prepping with word list , but it's not as big deal as you might think of it to be. I've seen people going crazy to learn all the words, instead stay calm take them in as you encounter them. Few things that worked out for me were:1- Reading - and the best thing to read when you want to enhance your vocab is newspaper, (The hindu, my personal choice). I used to read editorial everyday and mark the words that I couldn't understand. Gradually, in a week or two you'll start coming across familiar words.2- POS- secondly, the meaning of the word is not enough, you need to know the parts of speech to which it belongs to, if you keep mugging up the word meanings, you might end up using them in wrong places , where they don't fit.3- memrise-  this is the website that worked marvels for me. memrise.com has all the wordlists that you might need. If you practice it regularly, I'm sure it'll help you a lot.4-Usage- using the words as you learn them is the most important thing you should do. You can use them in random conversations with friends. Initially though your friends might think that you are showing off your large vocab, but in the end you'll be the one who'll gain. Words that you use are going to stick to your mind, amf you'll be able to use it again amd again. And this my friend is THE MOST important trick.Hope it helps. All the best :)","Cultivate a habit of reading extensively. Any book (my personal recommendation are the classics), magazines – The Economist, Reader’s Digest,newspapers – NewYork Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian(the best content lies in the editorials, and definitely not in the Page-3/entertainment section), websites and news sites (BBC has some of the finest content).To learn something new (activity, word etc.), learn by making associations. To learn new words, learn them by associating with a few words you already know; and associating with a few sentences.Etymological associations are the best. Learn the root of these words, learn how they were derived. As a bonus, etymological learning opens your horizons to the whole family of new words derived from the same root.Another association is learning with the synonyms. As you come across the new words, learn the synonyms for these words. There's a very fair chance you might know one or more of them.Most importantly, learn by usage. Every new word you learn, understand how it's various forms are used in a sentence. This makes your learning much more concrete. It is now a well established fact that you cannot learn a word by looking at it once, unless you are gifted with anesthetic memory.For the common people like us, we need to read them once, twice, thrice,and many more times. A general thumb rule is that you have to get exposed to the word 4-7 times (tend to the higher side for the more complex words), distributed over 15 days. That drills the word into your sub-conscious mind. Make it a habit to recall these new words regularly. As you read any website or newspaper, try replacing the words with the new set of words you've learnt.Last,and perhaps the best thing you can do is use this newly gained vocabulary as often as possible. You might, at times, sound outlandish; that's fine. Remember, vocabulary is like Siri, the more you use, the better it gets.I used Vocabsmith GRE app and it was very useful to remember words. It helped me learn the words, meanings, etymology, pronunciation, meanings with their usages. Further, VocabSmith would revise all the words over 2-3 weeks; this ensured I wouldn’t forget the words. I had subscribed to their GRE – High Frequency Package(1000 words) and could learn all the words in approximately two months.1.iOS:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/...2.Android:https://play.google.com/store/ap..."
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"

But I did use GREedge and can vouch for it.I recently gave my GRE and can say confidently that I scored a good score. DUring the start of my preparations a few months before I too was confused between the two and while enrolling was thinking on for which of these two online preps should I register for. For me the choice was simple as I did want to score better than last year. I went with GREedge for a simple reason that it's based out of India where I am from and It did have positive reviews and recommendations from some who had earlier enrolled for their prep courses.I enrolled two months before my exam and took an appropriate course. The course material was very thorough, both for the verbal and Quant Sections. Their SFA’s (Student Advisors) were very supportive and did answer all the doubts and questions posed to them, with additional materials to practise whenever requested. I personally found them good at their jobs in guiding students. They also assisted in completing the course on schedule. Their web interface was also pretty adaptable and could start at get go from the very beginning. Just had an issue with their word bots but then am pretty bad at mugging up things leave alone 8000+ words. Even after enrolling to any of the courses (which you must choose after a good research about either of them so that they are suitable for you, just keep in mind its always better if you also parallely prepare in your own time with the additional materials because the better you practise the better score you get. So, all the best.","I recently gave my GRE scored 311{Q:162;V:149;W:4}. Some may find this to be a very average score as compared to 320+ or 330+ which people get so frequently. Then again we should primarily understand that we do not learn anything new for the purpose of taking GRE, instead our aptitude is tested on the things we already know and have had these stuff as a part of our coursework at some part of our academics. I have a lot of respect for the people who do not prefer any assistance while preparation.However I felt that I needed some assistance as I was out of touch with academics for 2 years almost. Also the people whom I live with at present are not into such a culture. I enrolled for GRE-EDGE as a few of my batchmates had already excelled in GRE with this organisation and suggested me to take up one of their programs. I would try to be as much unbiased as possible and go on with my experience as I never enrolled for magoosh as most of their material were already availavle in form of free apps or free videos.Now what I liked about EDGE was that they had variety of difficulty levels. So I was bound to practice more and more. A personal facilitator is assigned to every enrolled student who would provide constant feedback to the student. In my case I took the initiative to go after my facilitators, I used to e-mail them on a regular basis and they would get back to me on mail with resoonse to each and every query.I felt the 2 major regions where I feel I was got the benifit out of the program were:-Time Management: EDGE questions(advanced practice+mock) are having higher difficulty levels. In my actual GRE I had a lot of time to go back to each question and revise.Question Oreintation: My facilitators had mailed me certain materials apart from the learning portal. Mostly PDF samples, which gave me idea on certain tips and tricks(4Q), slideshows for SE and RC tricks, sample essays (4W) rated 1–6 like how I should write and how I should not.I feel GRE-EDGE even though is not as famous as magoosh, but they do offer valued service an you can well go ahead with any one of their programs.","I was enrolled with GRE edge for 4 months and I must say that their service is really pathetic. Their so called “ Personal SFA’s “ call only when they have another offer for u ( like when they want you to subscribe for the TOEFL prep on their portal ). My verbal sfa never picked up the call and their is always this communication gap. What these SFA’s do is basically they chalk out a plan , and that’s it. The plan is created in such a manner that u complete the whole portal before ur GRE (including some style tests and a few full tests as well). So their is no rocket science in this.During these 4 months , I was contacted only 4–5 times by them . ( That's how personal they get. ) I expected these guys to call me at least before my D day to discuss any sought of plans or strategies or a little motivation maybe!! But I Only received a computer generated mail and text sms saying all the best , and a few tips here and their. That's it.Content wise they are okay . But do not expect anything more. Also , their portal looks very out dated and mechanical. ( No videos , only text,) I also found it hard to skip topics sometimes. (Unless you complete the one before ) So it does lack a sense of flexibility .The only thing I liked was the wordbot app which helps u to learn words using mnemonics. You can even revise words by filtering out the list u are focusing on .In conclusion i would say that, it really depends on your preparation level and what score you are aiming for. It’s always better to go for standard books and materials. I haven’t used magoosh , but from what i have heard , their content ,videos,strategies are top notch and they have been in this race for quiet a long time .And they do stand out when it comes to the content. (without any doubt). It would be wise to not get fooled by terms like “Personal SFA” or “Personal tutor”. Ultimately it’s all your effort that adds up. The only reason why i took up online GREEdge was because i had to juggle between my job and gre prep(otherwise i would have opted for physical classes rather than online), and i thought that this concept of “personal SFA” might keep me focused throughout the journey. But only later i realized how cleverly this B.S. concept was sold to me .P.S. Not trying to denigrate GreEdge . Some XYZ might have had a better experience than i had, and it’s totally fine. Just thought that it would be great to share it in a forum . Cheers!"
GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It's ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!You could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your termsKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms","It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.You’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.You’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.You have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it. You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door. But, remember ‘freelancing job is also an actual job’. There’s nothing fancy about it until you make it.Before you are a freelancer you should prepare for being one. These is a simple road-map which you need to follow with determination, to make through this challenge.ACQUIRING SKILLS:This is the most important part. You need to acquire skills in whatever field you choose. You may find this boring and have an urge to jump over and look up to the offers. You may have misconceptions of having all necessary skills. But, this is the only way you can be successful in long run.Take a break to start an elaborated research in the chosen field and the specializations they demand.Look out for dummy projects to build a great portfolio. Offer to work with your peers, friends and nonprofit organizations for free.Keep a close look at people already in the industry and look up to their work. Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.MANAGING NETWORKSLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.Now that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.BEING THE BRANDThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.You need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help. Get your business cards and be ready to talk about the work you do and yourself more often.Learn some basic marketing and accounting skills. Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.THE ADVENTURE RIDENow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!Start looking out for jobs. This might be a slow-moving process, instead of getting stressed introspect your offers.At first work on project/job expecting limited or no money at all. This is to just make connection sharpening your skills and showcasing your talent. These resources might be helpful to start off: Upwork, Guru, Elance, PeoplePerHour, Freelancer, Craig list;Once you have built a quality portfolio and demonstrated your work it’s time to hunt big offers. Serve the clients with generosity, build a rapport. Businesses will start taking you seriously about your specialization.Your career will see a boost. In the long run, you can either be choosy about your project or take projects in volumes, both are keys to success. With time, you’ll be able to create a Brand which clients and businesses will look up to.Finally, keep up the good work and regularly meet other freelancers, talk them about your business. Use calling more often than emailing to a client. These things will give your brand a personal touch and also avoid the feeling of isolation. Now, you are independent and can set your own working ethics being selective about projects and jobs. The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.This answer is a part of my blog, read it here.If you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.Please do let me know your suggestions and feedback.I’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.","For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.That doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.But I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.For example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”To that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.Of course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.Here are a few:You learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.There are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.It’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.You get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?Freelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.Bottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.And you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.If you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.On the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.Once you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.","Let’s start step by step:1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.If you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:Freelancer - Hire & Find JobsUpworkCraigslistPeoplePerHour99designsGuruEngineerBabuHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.2. Build a Perfect websiteAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.While building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.Show diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.Include your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.If you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.3. Brand YourselfOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-Whether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.Along with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.Your logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.Most importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.The domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.Become a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.4. Understand the project requirement carefullyAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.The only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.9. Be ProfessionalWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-Starting date of projectThe project’s deadlineMilestonesFunctionalitiesSchedule meeting in priorMake the clear timeline of deliverables.Professionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–Keep Your Personal Life limited to yourselfYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.  It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.Charge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.Schedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.If some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.Build the right association.It is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.Follow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.Don’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.Be positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.10. Networking and Relationship with ClientsBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..Some useful techniques to grow your network.1. Increase your Social Media Network  Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.  2. Attend events You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.3. Speak at events Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event. 4. Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at. 5. Connect at co-working space You can share your desk with other freelancers from another field; this is the best way to enrich knowledge and network.  All points listed above reinforces you to become a freelancer, your perfect profile generation for freelance success and helps you in becoming your own boss with a promising career ahead."
GRE,"How many words does one actually need to learn for the GRE? What is the correct method to prepare for the GRE verbal? I have Magoosh 1000 Words, Barron’s 800 Essential Words, the Manhattan RC Guide, and the Manhattan 5lb for practice.",https://www.quora.com//How-many-words-does-one-actually-need-to-learn-for-the-GRE-What-is-the-correct-method-to-prepare-for-the-GRE-verbal-I-have-Magoosh-1000-Words-Barron’s-800-Essential-Words-the-Manhattan-RC-Guide-and-the-Manhattan-5lb-for-practice,"Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Standardized Tests, Words, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",13,"Let me tackle the second part of your question first:What is the correct method to prepare for the GRE verbal?Be careful assuming that the “correct” (maybe I’ll use “best” or “preferred” since there are plenty of good variations of study plans) way to prepare includes the sheer memorization of hundreds of obscure vocabulary words.  On each of the two verbal sections that “count” (you’ll also get a section that’s for research purposes and doesn't count, and that might be verbal or it might be math), you’ll see 10 “vocabulary” questions (typically 6 Text Completion and 4 Sentence Equivalence).  Figure on average you’ll see about six answer choices per problem, meaning that overall on test day you’ll see 120 answer choices that fit “vocabulary.”But go through official practice problems and you should see that most of those words are fairly common, some answer choices (for the multi-blank Text Completions) are phrases and not just vocab words, and of the “not everyone is going to know this word” words, many appear as a single answer choice among other choices that are common words.  Meaning: if one of the words you do know is right, then the one you don’t is wrong, and if the words you do know are all wrong, then this bizarre word is right by process of elimination.So memorizing 1,000 individual words is a long, circuitous route to honing in on the handful of times that you might need to make a decision between two or more “hard” vocab words.Then add these elements:Unless the word came directly from a modern ETS-written GRE problem, it’s just a hard vocabulary word that someone who doesn’t write for the GRE thinks might be a word on the test.  Which also means that it probably comes from an old test, either the old (pre-2011) GRE, which had much more of an emphasis on obscure vocabulary, or the old (pre-2016) SAT, which also emphasized uncommon words.  So most words you memorize won’t appear on your test, and some have a very low (if nonzero at all) probability of showing up there.The modern GRE doesn’t directly test pure word meaning: it’s all about how the word fits into the context of the sentence.  And a good deal of vocab memorization comes out of context, memorizing a dictionary or flashcard definition without really becoming familiar with how that word is used in various situations.And what it really boils down to is this:  remember those commercials for kid cereals (Lucky Charms, Count Chocula, Froot Loops…) that said “part of a healthy, well-balanced breakfast” but then also had a quick shot of all the food you probably should have been eating instead (a banana, maybe some eggs, some fresh fruit…)?  Memorizing some vocabulary is “part of a well-balanced study plan” but it’s not the most important or most valuable part.  You have to know some vocabulary, but your primary score gains will come from learning how to do the problems and reason your way through them.So with all that said, here are some core elements of a quality GRE Verbal study plan:Devour the official ETS-written problems.For one, only ETS really knows which words it will test and which ones it won’t, and any other resource is only making an educated guess.  So make sure you prioritize the official GRE study books, and the official ETS PowerPrep practice tests.  If the authors of the GRE have put it in their resources, it’s a word worth getting to know.But that’s not all!  As you go through the official questions, you’ll get a good feel for how they’re written (I’ll touch on that more a little further down) and what types of action items you’ll need to attack the questions.  This is really important - there’s a definite style and feel to the official problems, and the more you’re in sync with that style the better your study tactics will be directed right at the target.2. Find vocabulary words in context.One huge problem with just sheer flashcard memorization is that you’ll learn some combination of a formal definition and one single usage of that word.  But you’re not directly tested on the meaning of the word: you’re tested on its usage.  So with any word, Google it and then click on “News” and read it as it’s used in a handful of articles.3. Learn words in families.Again, think about how you’ll be tested on these words.  In Sentence Equivalence, your job is to find two words that give the sentence the same, logical meaning.  So learning multiple words that mean the same or similar things (loquacious and garrulous both mean “talkative” or “wordy,” the opposite of succinct) sets you up for questions in which you’ll often need to find pairs.  And with Text Completion, often you’ll see that the sentence requires agreement between two blanks or between one blank and a given word; in these cases, it’s also helpful to know “these words tend to go together.”  So for any “new” word, find a few related, similar words that you already know and think about them together.  And if multiple new words have similar meanings, try to learn them together also.4. Pay attention to roots.Learning words one at a time is pretty inefficient.  So similar to grouping them in families above, picking up on roots that give words similar meanings can help you get more mileage out of each thing you memorize.  Knowing that “mal” is a prefix for “bad” means that even if you don’t know the exact meaning of “malicious” or “malevolent” or “malignant,” you have a pretty good sense that they’re words that mean “bad.”  So if the meaning of the blank has to be “good” you can eliminate those words, and if it’s something negative then unless you see a better fit that you know for sure, you can feel confident picking one of the mal- words.  This website was one of my favorite resources as I was writing up our section on roots in the Veritas Prep lesson book: English Language RootsNow, those are great strategies for learning vocabulary in a GRE-efficient way, but keep in mind that Text Completion and Sentence Equivalence are not explicitly vocabulary exercises!  So as you study, you should also:5. Pay attention to subtle differences between word meanings.This is something that GRE students don’t do nearly enough!  Lots of questions are designed to hinge not on the definition of an obscure word that you’d never use yourself, but on the very precise meanings of words that you use frequently.  I love the problem in this video, for which the whole thing comes down to the difference between “massive” (very big) and “excessive” (too big).  To the untrained or slightly-unfocused (or focused on the wrong thing) they both mean the exact same thing related to “big.”  But the GRE does a great job of requiring (or ruling out) specific meanings and punishing those who take a meaning that’s really close but not exact.6. Think about the second, third, fourth, etc. definitions of a word, not just the most obvious one.Another theme that gets people down is that they quickly make decisions on words based on one definition, without considering some of the lesser-used definitions of those words (cue Led Zeppelin “there’s a sign on the door but she wants to be sure, for you know sometimes words have two meanings…”).  There’s one in an official practice test where just about everyone rules out the word “plastic” - you need a word that means flexible/pliable/malleable - because we all think of plastic material, but then you go through the other answer choices and…maybe one word you’re not exactly sure of but the others don’t really work.  And it’s so, so common…about half of people I see pick the word they don’t know (“well, it isn’t these so it must be that”) and the other half go through a second pass and essentially say “I’d use a different word myself, but yeah I guess plastic does fit here…”One of our instructors called me a couple weeks ago after scoring a perfect 170/170 and as we were debriefing his test, he specifically highlighted that exact takeaway.  He said that much of the test was very comfortable, but on each verbal section at least two problems came down to him having to really dig deep on “wait…but that word that I was about to eliminate actually has several other meanings.” And he specifically called out a strategy we talk about with regard to that “plastic” problem - before you eliminate a word, see if you can change the part of speech.  “Plastic” as an adjective may mean fake, or cheap, or something pertaining to the material plastic.  But “plasticity” as a noun absolutely conjures up the meaning “flexibility/pliability” and helps you realize that “plastic,” via a definition lower on the hierarchy in the dictionary, gives you what you need.7. Be ready to work on these problems.One last limitation to the centrality of vocab memorization is that anything you expressly memorize for conjures up the idea of “hey you either know the meaning or you don’t.”  But so many GRE verbal problems are a lot more about trial and error, plugging in an answer choice or two and seeing if they work together, then going back and trying another combination, and really asking yourself deep down “would anyone really write that sentence?”  Here’s one more video that deals with that topic - any of the problems for which there are multiple answers (Text Completion with more than one blank; Sentence Equivalence where you have to choose two answers) aren’t just an exercise in picking one answer, then moving on and picking the next.  You may find one meaning you love but then have to really critically consider whether you can match it with the other blank or another choice.  And the danger comes from then forcing a square peg in a round hole, so to speak, on that next decision.  GRE Verbal now more than ever really rewards critical thinking - the meaning of the sentence is so crucial but people spend too much of their time memorizing meanings of words.  And as you practice with official problems, you’ll start to learn that lesson and hopefully better focus your preparation on these strategies that will help you master the questions, whether you’ve memorized 1,000 words or even just 100.","Hi, I would strongly suggest that you absolutely know BYHEART ALL THE WORDS in1. Barrons book (50 Word lists) and the2. Magoosh Gre Vocabulary word lists (approx 1000 words) app (not the vocab builder app).From my experience, this is MORE THAN ENOUGH to get a 160+ verbal score.I recall, 2 days before test day, i took a GRE Powerprep test and i got EVERY sentence completion answer right in the 1st verbal section and only 1 or 2 wrong in the 2nd section. This i will most certainly attribute to my mugging up the entire Barrons and Magoosh words as mentioned above.Also i would like to add, these word lists help greatly even in the RC.I strongly suggest against any new-age methods like flashcards, learning roots and etymology, Norman-Lewis books etc for learning words - you will not get any words outside these 2 lists, so dont complicate things unnecessarily.","No matter how many words you memorize, you will not score high in GRE verbal just by knowing the words.What you need is to understand the word usage in context. GRE will never test you on your ability to cram. It is about how you can use the words.The trick here is to always try and simplify the statement in your own words and then choose the option from the answers that you think resembles the most to the simplified word used by you. I scored low in verbal (153) because I did not heed this advice. The sentences proved to be too confusing just by the language being used in the exam. It was very complex.Even the verbal section is supposed to measure your analytical ability and it does exactly that, even when the words are such which you would never use in simple English language.My advice would be: Learn the words in context. Learn to use them properly.Make it a habit to summarize statements/paragraphs in your own words.Read, read and read a lot. Aldaily and Scientific American will help.Manhattan Prep is a good guide and you have ample word resources.Best of Luck!","It should actually depend on how big your vocabulary already is. But at the very least, you should master/learn 10 words per day.

GRE,What can I do to improve my verbal score in the GRE from 153 to 160+?,https://www.quora.com//What-can-I-do-to-improve-my-verbal-score-in-the-GRE-from-153-to-160+,"Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Self-Improvement, Exams and Tests",8,"Here's a list of steps you can take to improve your score to the extent possible at such short notice:Reasons for Mistakes: You mentioned a couple of PowerPrep tests that gave you scores of 153. Your big duty now, and for the rest of your 4 days until test day, is to make a list of every single question that you got wrong and the reason you made those mistakes. If it's a vocabulary problem, write down the word in a separate notebook and go through all its possible meanings in different contexts with the help of Google or a Thesaurus. If it's because you're falling into choice traps, do the same for every word that confuses you. Repeat the process for every single question you've ever got wrong, analyze why you got them wrong, and do what you have to do to make sure you never make the same mistakes again. You've made it clear you've done the needful as far as memorizing vocab goes, so your problem isn't learning new words, it's becoming familiar with all the different contexts in which the words you already know can be used. Because ultimately, that is GRE Verbal's most crucial skill, context. More Practice? : If you feel like you're confident you won't repeat the same mistakes you've already made and you've still got time to burn, practice! Especially when it comes to Reading Comprehension, the more practice that you can get under your belt, the better. You can get plenty of practice questions on GRE Verbal from Prep Books, Magoosh or even online with just a simple Google Search. Practice as many questions as you can, analyze your mistakes if you get them wrong, and make sure you don't repeat those mistakes. That's the way to go about it. The Time Management Problem: When I wrote my GRE, I wouldn't give myself more than 1 minute to use my strategies and arrive at the best possible answer, and I expect the same from you. Because, quite frankly, the lack of negative marking for wrong answers means you've GOT to attempt every single question on the GRE to the best of your ability, and I'll leave it to you to find a way to make that happen. My suggestion? Leave RC for last. It's a time-intensive question type. RC Strategy: Do NOT read the paragraph first. You're stressed for time on GRE Verbal as it is. Reading the paragraph before you look at the question is the biggest mistake you'll ever make on GRE Verbal. Instead, read the question first, and then search for the answer within the paragraphs. Because Reading Comprehesion questions are generally arranged according to the order in which their answers appear in the paragraphs, that should allow you to systematically answer one question after another.Trap Answers: When it comes to answer choices, my strategy for GRE Verbal was to physically cover the answer choices on the screen with my hands while reading the question. Basically, you do NOT want to be looking at the answer choices before you read the question. Read the sentence first, think of the most suitable word that could complete the sentence, and then look at the options. The test-setters are very well aware that there are students who simply hunt for synonyms and eliminate answer choices without reading the question beforehand, so there usually is a trap answer hidden among the answer choices that's tempting to pick because of one or more similarities it's got with the right answer. This tends to happen most often in Sentence Equivalence and Text Completion, where you have to choose answers that fit best. Use your knowledge of context and make intelligent guesses to select the right answers from among the choices.Most importantly, relax! Any score of around 320 on the GRE is good enough to satisfy that requirement of your applications. If your GRE scores are lower than you want them to be, you can always take the test again in a month as well. And by the way, the actual test on the day of the GRE is usually easier than most mock tests and practice tests you'll find from PowerPrep and Magoosh. Try and improve your Quant score as well if you can, and you'll be all set to write the GRE in a few days. Best of luck!","Keep in mind the following GRE Verbal tips as you study before test day.1.	Use roots, prefixes, and suffixes to determine the meaning of words you don’t know.2.	Vocabulary is essential. When it comes to the GRE Verbal section, that’s the bottom line. Be proactive: look up words you don’t know!3.	On definition questions, guess quickly! Many questions require you to know the definition, and because it’s likely that you can’t use much logic to get to a better answer, select one and move on. You can always come back if you have time.4.	Find your personal reading passage strategy. If you read the questions first, when you read the passages, you can focus on finding the right answers most quickly. However, some students find that reading the passage first helps them understand the argument more generally first, before delving into the specific questions.5.	Pay special attention to the first and last sentences. They provide important clues to the meaning of each passage.6.	Questions with Roman numeral answers are often confusing and difficult. They ask you choose one more or to find an exception. If you’re running low on time, mark down a guess and move to the next question.7.	Think of an obvious opposite word in your head on Antonym questions first, before you look at the answers.8.	On Reading Comprehension, make sure your answer actually answers the question, and isn’t just a true statement.9.	With analogy questions, create a sentence in your head that shows the relationship between the two words and then use that sentence on each answer choice.10.	On sentence completion questions, find connector words like “although” or “but” that may change the meaning of the sentence.You can also check out my videos","Time management will only come with practice. As for RC, this is a strategy that worked for me. I'd read one para of the passage and answer the related questions. Keep in mind though, after reading the next paras, the answer to the previous question may change. So, it is necessary to be alert and keep that in mind while answering the questions. See if it works for you. Good luck!","Given that there are only 4 days left for the exam, I would spend most time on more and more practice  and not worry too much about learning new material. You need to manage your time properly and that would come form giving more practice test and getting familiar with the test layout (how many questions in each section and how much time to spend on each type of question).SubmitAlso, in the day prior to the GRE, I would just chill and relax, so that is what I would advise you to do too!"

If you are a quantum physicist with a penchant for vocab who enjoys spending your time, solving convoluted math problems you do not need much time for preparation. If cramming means two to three weeks, then you don’t have to be our aforementioned quantum physicist. For those that are relatively adept at math, you can score well with little preparation. Preparation for the test will depend on the amount of time you have available and your personal preferences for how to prepare. When taking the computer-delivered GRE General Test, you are free to skip questions that you might have difficulty answering. The testing software has a ""mark and review"" feature that enables you to mark questions you would like to revisit during the time provided to work on that section. The testing software also lets you view a complete list of all the questions in the section on which you're working, indicates whether you've answered each question and identifies the questions you've marked for review. The GRE is broken down into three primary components: verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing. For the verbal reasoning section, test takers have two 30-minute periods to answer two sets of 20 questions. Test-takers answer two sets of 20 quantitative reasoning questions, with 35 minutes to answer each set. The analytical writing section consists of two essays, for which test takers get 30 minutes to write each. The verbal and quantitative reasoning sections are graded on a 130- to 170-point scale in 1-point increments, and the analytical writing section is scored on a 0-6 scale in half-point increments.Every student decides what he or she needs for an exam, what resources are better, etc. Many GRE test takers are many years removed from the basic tenets of high school math, which play an important part in the quantitative section of the test. If you're rusty, it's important to revisit the concepts of algebra and geometry that you learned in high school.

Today, I’m happy to announce that I’ve made some updates to our Best GRE Books List! While not all of these books are from this year (some are far from it), the list offers my honest GRE book reviews and recommendations for the best GRE book options on the market.Best GRE Books 2016 – 2017It’s 2016 and, to be honest, not a lot has changed in the GRE prep book landscape in the last few years. This is good news for you—you can head to Amazon and buy inexpensive (new or used) versions of many of the best GRE books below and know that you’re not sacrificing quality for price.In this post, I list the best GRE prep books on the market and explain the positives and negatives of each. If you’re just interested in reading about one or two, use the links in the Table of Contents to jump to that section of the post.Best GRE Prep BooksWithout any further ado, I present you with the list of the top 8 best GRE prep books (in order) and three books deserving of an honorable mention (in no particular order).Most publishers change very little content from one edition to the other. If I can save you money by recommending an old edition of a great book, then I’m going to do that!1. Magoosh GRE BookBetween the covers, this 468-page book packs more than a hundred practice questions accompanied by comprehensive explanations—all pulled directly from our renowned online GRE prep product. Not only is the book loaded with tons of useful information, but each question and answer has been triple checked by industry experts to maximize students’ learning.2. Free GRE eBooksTangible or not, the eBooks are free and they provide a wealth of helpful strategies. Along with the rest of Magoosh’s free GRE resources, they are a great way to start your GRE journey, before deciding on which book to purchase.3. ETS’s The Official Guide to the GRE Revised General Test, 2nd EditionThis is the holy grail of prep. If you can only buy one book, this is it. The tone of the voice may not be as friendly as almost any other book on the market. But if you can bear the dry content, you are getting by far the best practice since ETS writes the questions for the test.Throw in two GRE computer-based tests, which are in a CD that accompanies the book, and the best GRE book on the market gets even better.4. ETS’s Official GRE Verbal Reasoning Practice Questions & Official GRE Quantitative Reasoning Practice QuestionsThe strategies are nothing new (you can learn all of those from this blog), but this book is a must-buy, if only for the quality of its practice questions. The Quantitative Reasoning book, on the other hand, contains both helpful practice problems and useful new strategies. A word of warning: these new math problems are really challenging. They’ll definitely require some extra attention, and will help you up your quant game.5. Barron’s 6 GRE Practice TestsThis book is not perfect. But it is better than the Barron’s general GRE guide.6. Practicing to Take the GRE General Test, 10th EditionThis is a version of the old GRE, and the old, old GRE at that (the tests were taken from 1991, a year some of you had yet to enter the world). Yes, the math is much easier. Still, these are questions created by the writers of test, so the traps are classical GRE. I wouldn’t use this as a foundation for my GRE test prep, but check out the review to see if it’s a good fit for your studies: Practicing to Take the GRE, 10th Edition Book Review.The Reading Comprehension passages are still tough and make for good practice. And while they’ve cut the Antonym and Analogy sections, the antonym questions still make for good practice (the analogies contain many ridiculous words, such as names of tools and sewing implements).7. The Manhattan GRE Series (MGRE) – Books One Through EightThs series contains eight (mostly excellent) books written by those with years of tutoring experience. This fact really shines through in the authorial voice this series uses. You feel as though there is a highly intelligent, but fun, laid back tutor walking you through the material.The six free online tests you get by simply buying any one of the eight books makes MGRE a no-brainer if you want expert guidance and great practice.8. Vibrant’s GRE Analytical Writing: Solutions to Real Essay Topics BooksBook 1These books from Vibrant Publishing GRE Analytical Writing: Solutions to Real Essay Topics and GRE Analytical Writing: Solutions to the Real Essay Topics – Book 2 are a welcome addition to the GRE literature scene. Not because they’re perfect, but because they contain GRE sample essays … something few books have. They’ll help you craft a decent response to a range of GRE essay topics. Not required reading, but definitely helpful if you want to improve your essay score.GRE Book Honorable MentionThis book is generally substandard, and if after reading my review (see below), you are surprised I’m pairing it with this top five list, then I owe a quick explanation: the inclusion of the The Princeton Review book speaks to the generally low quality of GRE prep books out there.9. The Princeton Review, Cracking the GRE, 2017 EditionThese strategies are mostly absent from the Official Guide (though I share similar strategies in the eBook and on the blog).That said, two major caveats: Do not use this book if you are looking for a high score. The strategies are very generic; they apply to most standardized tests, and they won’t help you understand the nuances or advanced concepts in the GRE. Secondly, do not do the questions, unless you are scoring way below 50% and are just starting off on the GRE. From this book glean some helpful strategies that you can use on actual test questions. Otherwise, this book is not of much use.Since this book remains almost exactly the same from year to year, here’s the review of an older version: Princeton Review: Cracking the New GRE 2012 Book Review10. Kaplan New GRE Premier 2011-2012 Book ReviewThe 2014 Kaplan book is no different from the previous two years. Test prep strategies that are very high-level and not that innovative, followed by subpar questions. That is, these questions aren’t like what you’ll see test day in terms of difficulty or style. It’s better to not waste one’s time with this book.McGraw Hill’s New GRE with 8 Practice TestsHere are dozens, if not hundreds, of GRE books on the market. Good luck!","I wrote GRE in 2015 and scored 330/340 after preparing for 20 days.I scored 170/170 in Quant and 160/170 in Verbal. I learned words using Barron's 1100 words android application and Word power made easy(Norman Lewis).Barron's 1100 app link: Barron's 1100 - Android Apps on Google PlayWord power made easy: Buy the book, it's very cheap.I learned words from only these two sources and almost all the words on actual exam were covered by these two sources. Make sure that you do not simply cram the meanings. Try to understand the context.I think learning these two sources in their entirety is sufficient for building a decent vocabulary for GRE. I got 113/120 in TOEFL too by only these too sources. If you have time, go for Magoosh flash cards App and learn only first two levels, leave the advanced one.One important part for preparation is to be able to apply what you have learned, and for that you need a lot of practice. Buy Manhattan 5 pounds book. It has a lot for questions for practice. After learning the vocabulary, practice the questions from Manhattan book. Put more emphasis on RCs and Paragraph completion.For a good GRE score, one advice would be to maximize score in Quant. I used Barron's GRE book for revising basic mathematics concepts and used Manhattan 5 pounds for practice. Do not forget to prepare for the essay part, otherwise you will get an awful 3 like me!Good Luck for your exam.","You should definitely get the ETS Official Guides for the GRE if taking the exam before August 1 or Revised GRE if taking the exam after Aug 1.Barron's has been and still is great for their list of vocab words.  A common misconception is that the new/revised GRE doesn't test vocab.  The revised GRE does test vocab, however it's vocab in context meaning that you will have clues from a sentence to help you. So Barron's is still a good bet.The GRE Big Book (again by ETS) is arguably the best source of practice questions for the GRE. It contains over 5,000 questions from 27 actual tests.  The major catch is that it's not longer sold by ETS, but you could search for used ones. I've seen them go for as much as $300.Outside of books, online/computer-based tools are also great for GRE prep as they provide an experience more similar to the actual exam than books do.  Again, ETS is the best source of questions with their Powerprep (for the current GRE) and Powerprep 2 (for the revised GRE). But Powerprep lacks explanations to questions.  My company, Magoosh (http://gre.magoosh.com), has online products for both the current GRE and the new GRE with video explanations for most questions.  There are several others with products for the current GRE and I have yet to see another company with a new GRE online product with the new question types.I'd suggest using a combination of books and computer-based tools to prep. And using the Powerprep tests to assess your progress.","Recommended Books - These books are highly recommended for GRE preparation, listed with their pros and cons -1) The Official Guide to the GRE Revised General Test. By ETS.A must have because right now since ETS is more knowledgeable than any one else about the new format of GRE.Includes around 100 sample questions organized according to difficulty level.Has real essays written by test takers along with the ETS people’s evaluation and comments.2) Manhattan Prep GRE Set of 8 Strategy GuidesThese books are great.Majority of them (6 out of 8) are devoted to math: Algebra, fractions, geometry, number properties, word problems and quantitative comparisons. The practice questions in Math are divided into three sections easy, medium and hard.There are two books devoted to the verbal section: Reading comprehension and Text completion & sentence equivalences. The books dealing with verbal section consists of more challenging questions than what actually appears in the test.The interface is very similar to that of the actual test, and so is the difficulty.3) Barron’s New GREA good book for Quant.Does not have the word listYou can download the word list online or xerox it from an old Barron’s.Includes sample tests.Also includes a CD with stimulated tests (around 2).Other Books - The above mentioned books are actually enough for all the preparation you will need. But if you want some more books for extra practise, consider the following -3) Cracking the NEW GRE by Princeton.A good book for practice. Nothing special though.4) Kaplan NEW GRE PremierI have not used the book personally, but my friends swear this book is the reason they score high in their exam.Apart from that, I recommend getting your hands on the following too -(i) Nova GRE Math Bible (softcopy) - Excellent for math preparation. Has 1000s of questions organized according to difficulty levels and topics. Must Have!(ii) Voca Game based on Barron’s Word List - An excellent refreshing multiple choice game where you need to guess a word’s meaning. Has ALL Barron’s Words.(iii) Big Book (softcopy) - This book had a lot of old GRE papers but is now out of publication. Even though it has old GRE questions, they really help you increase your reading speed for RCs and test your words memory as well.You will also find the following online resources handy when preparing for the GRE -1) Practice tests and resources for high school, college and graduate tests - Though their RCs section has weird questions and answers.2) Home | Tyrannosaurus Prep - A fun word game for GRE and SAT though don’t rely solely on it to learn words as they do not have even half the important words that are present in Barrons. YOU CANNOT ESCAPE BARRON’S WORD LIST.Other Tips for GRE -Apart from that, here are some tips that you might find useful during your preparation-Preparing by yourself is absolutely fine. But if you do want to join a class, join Princeton/Kaplan classes (Quite expensive though). Or prepare on your own. Certainly doable.You need at least 2-3 months of preparation.Verbal preparation and memorizing words consume 80% of the time for most students. Start with high frequency word lists (around 500 words) to remember the important words first. Easily available on net. Then go on to Barron’s 5000 words list.You need to do Barron’s 5000 word list at least 2-3 times to remember most of the words.Don’t ignore math. Students often loose a lot of marks due to silly mistakes.READ THE QUESTIONS PROPERLY! Don’t ponder too long on a question though. Mark it for review and move on!"

all of our applicants can do that.  (The GRE-V and Analytical Writing sections are a little more interesting, because we also want our students to be able to write, talk, and think.  I'll always notice a grade in the 5.0-6.0 range on Analytical Writing.  However, I don't like to set my expectations too high for these scores, particularly for non-native English speakers, because they're related to degree of immersion in the English language - GRE-V tests vocabulary rather than clarity of thought and presentation.)Here's some sense of how we weigh the different factors:Answers for Prospective Graduate Students","Mihir's answer to Apart from good GRE scores, what are the other credentials required to ensure admission to a top foreign university for an MS program?","No.  The general GRE is an essentially worthless examination for the sciences.Your verbal and writing scores matter very little for a science program--all the program cares about is if you can effectively communicate in English.  These scores only matter if they are abysmal, signaling that English isn't your first language and that you aren't fluent in English as a second language.  This information will also be abundantly clear from your TOEFL scores (if needed) and personal statements.The quantitative portion of the exam should be completely trivial for any STEM graduate.  This portion of the exam essentially assumes you have taken no quantitative classes since high school.  If your score isn't close to perfect on the quantitative portion, you likely aren't a competitive applicant.A bad performance on the GRE could certainly earn you a rejection.  But a good performance says almost nothing about the student's potential for graduate school, and is weighed accordingly in admissions.Subject GREs require more specialized knowledge and can help a bit at some schools, but there is no canonical subject test for E/CS students to take."
GRE,How to crack gre with a score of 310+ in 10 days?,https://www.quora.com//How-to-crack-gre-with-a-score-of-310+-in-10-days,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Study Strategies, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Studying, Exams and Tests",17,"Writing this after 3 months since getting back my official scores. I figured that this might help other aspirants who might be having a time-crunch. Should have written this earlier but procrastinated :)First of all, allow me to give a brief overview of the turn of events that compelled me to take GRE in the first place.I work in at an IT MNC. Like many IT professionals in India, I had become disenchanted with my job after 2 years. Though I didn't particularly dislike it, the sheer redundancy forced me to look for other options.Like many of my peers, I took a crack at various MBA exams in India but my results were not up to the mark. At this point of time, seeing many of my friends take up higher studies in USA, I decided to write GRE. The thought of being left behind by my friends coupled with the lure of big bucks to be earned in US was difficult to ignore.Hence I booked my slot on 31st January. I took the earliest date available (10th February) so that I could apply for the fall program of some universities. Needless to say, I was on a really tight schedule. Time-management became crucial and I had to devise an effective plan that would make registering for GRE worth the investment (the benchmark for me was a 320+ score).Below is the section-wise breakdown of how I approached the 3 sections of GRE :Quantitative Reasoning - This is the section which can drastically boost your score. Assuming that you are reasonably familiar with the basic concepts of maths, a 160+ score can be easily achieved in this section. Having already prepared for those wretched MBA exams, I was pretty sure that I could achieve a 165+ score in this section. Word of advice to all aspirants - get your basics right, practice as much questions as you can and look out for trap questions.Verbal Reasoning - This section is quite tricky as you can’t really guess what will be thrown at you. Also, the humongous amount of GRE words can demoralize even the ardent vocab lovers. The trick for the vocab part is to learn the words in such a way that they are imprinted in your mind. For this I installed Memrise app on my phone. This is a really handy app and with its interactive mode of learning and regular reviews, I was able to learn some of the frequently asked words in GRE pretty easily. I briefly revised Norman Lewis's legendary Word power made Easy (a must read) book, which I had during my second year (this was 5 years ago) in college and to my astonishment, I could recall most of the words, such is the beautiful way in which this book is crafted. For RC’s and sentence completion I referred Manhattan material which I think is more than adequate. I had targeted a 155+ score in this section. Word of advice to all aspirants - don’t just mug up the words, that won’t help much. Try to figure out the root of the word, its popular usage or create an image of a tricky word in your mind. This way the probability of the retention of the meaning will drastically increase. Also, while doing RC’s read the whole text very carefully, don’t skim through any portion of it.AWA - Increasing your AWA score within a short time frame is difficult. I would advice all the aspirants to look at the responses given by various test takers and how they were evaluated/scored by the GRE essay readers. This would give you an idea about how to frame your response and the strategy that is to be employed while writing them.Besides this, take as much Practice tests as you can. ETS has 2 sample tests which are very good. Manhattan and Kaplan also provide free tests once you sign up on their website. Within the time-frame of 10 days, plan to take at least 5–6 Practice tests. After taking each test analyze your performance and see where you had made mistakes. These tests and their analysis are the most crucial part of your preparation, so spend more time on this.I hope this answer might help you out :)Suggestion are always welcome. Do let me know your questions/thoughts in the comments.","I just took the GRE last week after approximately 1 week of preparation and I scored a total of 328 with 165 in Math/Quantitative Reasoning and 163 in Verbal Reasoning.Note that universities look at the percentiles rather than the absolute scores. My scores put me at 90th percentile in Math/Quantitative Reasoning and 92nd percentile in Verbal Reasoning even though I had a higher score in the prior section.http://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre...I suppose I would be the most qualified to answer this question by taking my 7-day preparation experience, as compared to theoretical predictions from people who have not actually done it and are not basing their advice on any real 10-day preparation experience.In terms of strategy, it is much easier to get a higher absolute score in Quantitative Reasoning. (Thus the lower percentiles for a higher score in comparison to Verbal Reasoning.)Aim to score 165 for Quantitative Reasoning, which is easily possible with a few hours of preparation (I am assuming that you are smart enough and did well enough in Math previously to get into an undergraduate course). Having a 165 there gives you leeway to score just 145 for Verbal Reasoning to achieve a total score of 310.Preparation Breakdown:Day 1: spent 5 hours reading about GRE format, reading about the sources of preparation materials and their relative usefulness and effectiveness.Day 2: spent 7 hours looking for preparation materials and spent 3 hours on vocabulary flashcards.Day 3: spent 12 hours coding an addon for the flashcard application to give me more data about types of words I needed to pay more attention to.Day 4: had to do something else, spent 0 hours on GREDay 5: spent 3 hours on the official guide for Math, spent 2 hours on vocabulary flashcardsDay 6: spent 3 hours on vocabulary flashcardsDay 7: spent 3 hours on vocabulary flashcards, 2 hours on a sample testDay 8: spent 2 hours on flashcards, 2 hours on the official essay samples, 2 hours watching a newly released show, 4 hours on a test skipping all breaks,  1.5 hours analyzing my mistakesMost importantly: have at least 4.5 hours of sleep on the night before the GRE. I made the decision to get sufficient sleep instead of doing a 3rd test.Prior Ability and What I Had To Do:Scored A1 for O Level Math in middle school. GRE math essentially uses O Level Math fundamentals but is 10x more tricky and 4x more complicated. Even though it has been years since my O Levels, whatever I remembered was good enough, so I only skimmed through the basics in 10 minutes and didn't focus on them. I mainly focused on learning the tricky traps and making sure I didn't fall for the tricks and traps in the questions.Scored A1 for O Level English and A for A Level General Paper. For GRE Analytical Writing, I mainly looked at the structure of the essays, to identify how the essay structure answered the corresponding question, particularly for the Argument Task since it was very different from regular essays.Majority of vocabulary used in GRE Verbal Reasoning Text Completion Questions and Sentence Equivalence Questions is obscure as fudge. When I started, I did not know most of the vocabulary used in them, so I had to use flashcards to learn a few hundred words within the week. I spent the most time on this.GRE Verbal Reasoning Reading Comprehension Passages requires either prior understanding of English or probably months of preparation to bolster your ability to understand English. Did not prepare for this. Probably not possible to prepare this within 1 week.Traps to Avoid Since You're Very Very Tight on Time:Most of the free tests online are lousy and irrelevant to the actual GRE. Since you are very limited on time, and each test takes about 3 hours, it is a huge waste of time to do most of them. I looked at a couple and immediately felt they were weird. After having taken the real GRE, I would say those weird ones would have been a complete waste of time had I spent time on them.Your time would be better spent on flashcards and improving the speed that you can correctly do the existing RELEVANT questions.Focus your efforts on the 2 official GRE tests given to you. Focus on perfecting one while saving the other for an accurate assessment on the last day.","Since this question ask about complete preparation plan, my answer can be a bit longer..I will try to keep it concise as well as precise!Let us divide the preparation according to three sections and try to cover all of them in 3-4 months -Quantitative - If you are good with the basic concepts of mathematics, this section can  help you boost up your score with at least 5-8 marks easily. But let us assume you still have to improve you concepts. I would suggest, refer to quantitative aptitude by R.S. Agarwal. Read and understand first two pages of every chapter which contains theory part and short tricks. After getting a grasp over concepts practice questions from Kaplan's quantitative material. Do at least a chapter everyday. If you are not able to score well in quantitative section, then refer to my answer Aman Sharma's answer to How can I improve GRE quant score 143 to 160? That can help.AWA - This section requires a lot of reading and writing practice. Start reading articles from websites, newspaper and try to write a paragraph about what you have read and what did you understand. If you don't have time to proceed this way, then there is a short cut to get at least 3.5 in AWA (which I did). Find answers for issues and arguments topics on google and categorize the endless pool into different sections like education, technology, science, politics, government, society, culture, religion etc. Once you have categorized them read 4-5 answers for every section and try to remember examples that you have read. They will surely fit in any question that might appear in your GRE. But do practice writing once or twice in a week because you should be in a habit of bringing out the best in 30 minutes!Verbal - As it appears to most of us, the most tough section in GRE. But you can get a decent score if preparation is well planned. Have a mind set that you have to learn at least 1000-1500 words before you appear for GRE. You don't have to learn them all at once, but around 30 words everyday. Now let us start with book Barrens 333. Learn all 333 words perfectly. Once you are done with learning these words start practicing for questions. You have to attempt 20 questions of each type i.e. Sentence  Equivalence, Text Completion and Reading Comprehension everyday. Refer to Princeton 1014 for SE and TC & Manhattan 5lb for RC. If you complete these books go for Kaplan. Level of Kaplan is slightly more than what actually comes in GRE. Along with these questions keep learning new words and revising old ones. Remember learning new is not that important as remembering old ones. Also do not learn random words, search online for 1000 high frequency words and learn them first.So if we have to conclude with what we have to cover everyday, we can say that, an article/issue/argument answer, 30 words, 1 chapter of quantitative and 60 questions for Verbal.I hope this helps! Do post in comments if you have any question.","A2A A great thought, some of the aspirants have scored even 330+ with just a week to prepare. But you need a strong determination, being comfortable with both English and Math and must be able to squeeze out the most number of hours from the 10 days. A very good way is to score a perfect 170 in Math, and score 140 in verbal. Ah this seems quite plausible but scoring 170 is not everyone's cup of tea even how good they are in math. The key to score 170 in math is getting your basics correct, practicing hard and the last- not falling for trap answers. So given that the 170+140 option is almost ruled out(its very good if you are able to achieve this combination), you can try with the 165+145 option. Scoring 165 in math is reasonably easy(not as difficult as 170), but  the problem comes in scoring 145 in verbal, and this is due to the time constraint. So lets see how to score 145 in verbal. Each verbal section contains close to 1o RC questions, 5 sentence equivalence, 5 text completion. There you see RC questions are the low hanging fruit(its not that easy, I had just compared it to the other sections keeping in mind the time constraints you have). So a 15mark in verbal(145) can be scored by 8+7 breakup in the two sections. If you just brush up the basics of text completion and sentence equivalence, you can crack the easy questions. So the 8+7 need not be essentially from the RC's but its a mix of RC's+ SEq+ TCo.  For text completion's and sentence equivalence, you need a good vocabulary, but not for all the questions, you can surely aim for the easy questions by just reading the words from this list- GRE 400 Vocab Words and Top 101 High Frequency GRE Words - CrunchPrep GRE. By the way 80% of the words come from this list(they came in my exam). Practice TestsYou can find the best list of practice tests here- 33 Free GRE Practice Tests That You Should Definitely Take! - CrunchPrep GRE.

You need to know the following about the GRE exam before you start your preparation.The GRE exam has 3 sections the analytical writing section, the verbal section and the quants section.The analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to your GRE score so you needn’t break your head about it.The Quants and verbal section are for 170 marks each. The quants is the scoring section and you should ideally be looking to get 170/170 in this section. Anything more than 160 is a great score when it comes to verbal.You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 minutes in each of these sections.Something that most of the people don’t know is that the GRE is actually only for 80 marks but the marks are awarded out of 320 so that we don’t assume that a person who scores a 40 is only half as good as a person who scores 80 so the scores are given on a scale of 260–340.You needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.Getting to the hardest part of it all PREPARATION:You needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.Most people find the Quants section easy so you should just be trying to brush up on your basic concepts. I would suggest you make your concepts concrete and don’t get carried away in cramming as many formulas as possible. Once you’re confident enough try taking up a mock test and see where you stand, analyze your mistakes and then go back to those topics and make sure that there isn’t an Achilles heel. Spend as little time as possible preparing for Quants and I don’t think it will take up a lot of time. 1 hour a day for a month and you should be good to go.The dicey section is the verbal section and it will definitely be the make or mar factor in your GRE since you may not be accustomed to the language used. The best way to prepare for the verbal section is to READ. The verbal section is predominantly vocabulary based and being thorough with vocabulary might just make the difference between you getting into an average institute or premier institute abroad.Please try to stick to the following schedule:Spend two hours each day for the verbal section of GRE and one hour for the Quants section.Make sure that your preparation doesn't take a back seat during the weekends or due to some occasion like a friend's birthday.GRE Quants in a week:People are usually comfortable with the Quants section. If you are from an engineering or science background, you are already leaps and bounds ahead of your peers.1.Brush up your concepts and make sure you don’t get carried away and cram as many formulas as you can.2. Make sure that you approach each problem logically .3. Cover all the bases and make sure to go through each topic since Quants is a scoring section and you should ideally be aiming for 170/170 and nothing else.4. Practice each type of question and double check the concepts from high school that you never really understood but chose to skip anyway :P5. Be stubborn and don’t proceed until you get it right.Check out the best self study partner for cracking the GRE Quants section. I am pretty sure you will find this useful.GRE verbal in 10 days:GRE is predominantly a vocabulary based section. The quants section of the GRE isn’t very hard to crack and the analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to you GRE score. The verbal section will generally be the make or mar factor in your GRE and will make the difference between you getting into a premier institute or average institute abroad. If you are from an English medium school you would already be strong with your basics which makes it all the more easy for you to prepare yourself. Being thorough with the high frequency words can actually help you a lot. Check out the Barron’s 333.There are very few types of questions in the verbal section like text completion, sentence correction, reading comprehension and critical reasoning. I highly recommend the GRE verbal prep: A definitive guide. It is probably the best study material for a quick preparation. There are loads of practice questions and tests that are available along with videos which will definitely help you remember the words and their in-context meaning. Several shortcuts, tips and mnemonics are also a part of the videos. When you connect things with pictures, you remember them better which is exactly what the videos do. The etymology of the words are also dealt with in detail so that you can understand how a word came into existence and how it has evolved over the years.The MOCK frenzy with an error log:You still have a few days left. You should be taking up as many mock tests as possible. Go CRAZY!Keep solving questions and analyzing them.Keep a check on your progress.Identify the topics which aren’t really comfortable with. They may turn out to be the Achilles Heel on the day of the exam so don’t leave anything to chance.There is no point in solving umpteen number of problems from topics which are your strong suit. Solve more problems related to the topic which you aren’t comfortable withSolve → Analyze → Identify errors → solve more → RepeatOn the day before the exam JUST CHILL. Stop learning and don’t learn anything new since it is more likely that you will get confused because of it. Brush up on the concepts and KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK!A few of the following tips may come in handy:The GRE is a timed test: If we had all the time we need, then every one of us would get the perfect score on the GRE. But the GRE is a timed test, so it is important to not only be accurate but also quick when it comes to answering the questions. So when preparing for the GRE, time yourself. You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 mins both in the Verbal and the Quants section. Attempt a lot of mock tests it will help you a lot.Be aware of the wrong answers:The wrong answers generally tend to fall under certain categories which will help you eliminate the wrong choices when it comes to the GRE verbal reasoning section or reading comprehensions.The choices are most probably wrong if they:Assume too muchAre beyond the scope of the passageAre too extremeAre true but involve outside knowledgeAre too specific/too broadSave the worst for the last:They usually say save the best for the last but it doesn’t hold good when it comes to the competitive exams like GRE. You will end up wasting time if you attempt the unfamiliar questions. If you find a question complex, it is better to leave it for the time being and improve your score by answering the questions related to the easier and familiar questions.Utilize the scratch pad:Take short notes while reading the comprehension passage in the space allotted. Eliminate the unnecessary details and words which are just present to throw you off.The following are a few tips that might come in handy when it comes to the reading comprehension but they might also be applied to any question in the verbal section.DUMB them down:Questions on reading comprehension passages have the most gray area when compared to any other type of question in the GRE.Avoid skimming through the questions without understanding what is specifically being asked. If you find a question or choice confusing rephrase the question in your one words.Be on the look out for concessions:In many cases, the author may have a strong voice towards a certain topic or aspect in the passages. The author might have a strong opinion towards certain aspects in a passage and argue for it throughout the passage but then the author might suddenly stop doing so and make subtle or drastic concessions to the opposing side which will weaken the arguments that were previously made in the reading comprehension passage. Make sure that you aren’t thrown by such concessions.Make use of the context:If the question asked is related to a specific line in the reading comprehension passage, it won’t help if you just go back and read the sentence. The thumb rule is to read at least one sentence before and after the aforementioned line.Zero in on the idea behind the longer passages:Majority of the reading comprehension passages that you will come across while taking the GRE will be short but on the off chance that you encounter one or two longer ones, it is advisable to focus more on the first and last paragraphs of the passage and find the big picture of the passage, since time is of the essence.Find the tone of the passage:The tone of the passage can be found using the choice of words or the turn of phrases used by the author. Even if the tone appears to be neutral, assume that it is complex and look for the tone. You can arrive at the tone by observing the diction or by asking the following questions:Does the author feel positively or negatively about a certain topic?What aspect of the topic does the author criticize?What concerns does the author raise through the passage?Which adverbs and adjectives does the author use to voice his opinion?Last but not the leastWatch your diet: An important factor which most students ignore to their detriment is their health and diet. This is very important both during your preparation and while taking the test. Ensure that you stick to a nutritious diet since you will need a lot of energy during your preparation. It is a good thing to avoid eating outside especially junk food, during your preparatory phase. Also, refrain from drinking, partying and taking recreational drugs a week or two before the Test day.P.S. If you are looking for study material I would recommend the following:GRE verbal prep - A definitive guideGRE Prep: Crack the Quantitative Reasoning SectionGre Prep: Crack the Analytical Writing Assessment Section EffortlesslyGood Luck!","I scored 336 on my first shot (V166 V170,) and 20 is about the number of days I actually spent on studying for it. However, I started with a good foundation. With my SAT history and intense workload at college, I scored 320+ on my first mock test after I reviewed the vocabulary — in other words, it took me nothing but memorizing a few words to get myself at around 320.People at different levels or from different backgrounds require different strategies and time investment to reach that 320 goal. Regardless, the 20 days I spent got me 15+ points further. I can’t tell you how to reach 320 without knowing much about your background and needs, but I can tell you how to utilize a shorter time period to make some good progress:Focus. The famous 80/20 Rule states that roughly 80% of your outcomes come from 20% of your inputs.[1] This applies to GRE as well. There will be areas on GRE where you can most quickly improve. When the time is limited, you need to focus on those areas to make the most progress. Take a few mock tests and find those spots, and work on them relentlessly.Make mistakes. Don’t worry about them at all. It is a good thing to find yourself making mistakes when you’re practicing than you do on the real test. When you practice, you want to expose all the possible ways you make mistakes, and then find ways to avoid them. The reality is, aside from the vocabulary, GRE hardly covers anything that esoteric. In many cases, it’s the silly mistakes you make that really keeps you from getting your dream score. Learning how to avoid those mistakes can allow you to improve quickly. You just need to identify them first, by making them.Analyze. Don’t just practice questions after questions. Think about them. Find patterns, find how you get them wrong, and find quicker ways to solve these questions. At the end of the day, it’s not the quantity of questions that you practiced on that matters the most, it’s how you treat them. Don’t just focus on getting the questions right, focus on how to get better.Consolidate. After you’ve practiced, made mistakes, and analyzed them, now it’s time to consolidate your takeaways. Make yourself a list of actions you can take during the actual test to help yourself perform better. This could include double checking your zeros, or being more alarmed of particular words, or things you tend to forget or overlook. Take a good look at them before you take the test.Many of my friends have asked me how I got the score I have. Frankly this is it. Now I’m building Gregory to help people do these things automatically. I’d be happy to hear any thoughts/feedback on it.Footnotes[1] What Is The 80/20 Rule And Why It Will Change Your Life","First nothing is impossible for anyone to achieve. 21 days is a very short period of time and I don’t want to discourage you. But I do have some tips for a preparation.Vocabulary Building for Verbal Section - Take two alphabets each day and start memorizing at least 30 words per alphabet. Try grouping the synonyms together and writing down the antonyms. This will help you learning more words easily. Download the Magoosh Vocabulary flash cards app on your phone and start preparing right away.Barron’s 3000 word list is available online. You should read it and try acing as many words as possible.Quantitative - Make a time table with the detailed versions of every section in mathematics. You should take up one topic every day and start practicing different level difficulty questions. Try to remember the tricks, the area formulas, the shortcuts. Make a copy where you could note the tricks and the formulas which you glance every day before starting a new topic. Make ALERT AREAS AS THOSE YOU ARE TAKING MOST OF THE TIME SOLVING.Each day read essays on different GRE topics. Try framing your own essays and also practice the “ISSUE” Topic that comes for writing. It will be a refreshing break from your daily maths practice and will also help you think pragmatically in the direction of the topic.It is important to familiarize yourself with 3 hours while taking the GRE exam. Register for an online test series by Manhattan Prep or Princeton review. You should at least take 6 online tests before appearing for the GRE if your are aiming a score above 320. Look into your problem areas. Manage time and you will be well acquainted with what you will be facing on the real day of the examination. I feel with systematic approach and a lot of practice you can ACE the GRE.","20 Days - it is a really small amount for preparation, but you can manage it. Mind increasing the number of hours you’ll dedicate in studying (10 hours a day would suffice).This course gives you 2 weeks to be prepared - Fast and Smart GRE Prep Course by Nova Press. It is designed for those with only 2 weeks or more to prepare with strategies and tips you need to prepare FAST.Here is a schedule guide in Mastering Words for you:I am using the SMART Objective way in helping me prepare for any exam. Identifying the SMART Objective of your GRE Preparation would somehow look like this:S - Specific: Your end-goal should be stated, for example: Be confident when taking the GRE exam because I have prepared very well, studied every topic and even had practice tests to enhance more my skills. It should include the “W” questions: Who? What? Where? When? Which? and Why?M - Measurable: A proper schedule should be created and maintained. Establish a concrete number - how many number of words would you like to master? How many weeks would you like to spend for each GRE section? How will I determine if I have accomplished it?A - Achievable: A schedule with defined time and activity is something needed for preparation. Make sure that the words you wanted to master and the time you want to prepare would be achievable. Also, practice as many mock test as possible to avoid cram during exam.R - Realistic: Provide each list of words a realistic time to finish. Let’s say a list of 10 words can be mastered in 3 days or maybe a week. That includes reviewing it through games/the help of vocab app. I suggest you use Preped Vocab - for free. (But that depends on you)T - Time-based: Schedule, schedule, schedule. :)For more help, we have asked a couple of GRE tutors and authors with the following questions.

I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5.

GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,"Apart from good GRE scores, what are the other credentials required to ensure admission to a top foreign university for an MS program?",https://www.quora.com//Apart-from-good-GRE-scores-what-are-the-other-credentials-required-to-ensure-admission-to-a-top-foreign-university-for-an-MS-program,"The GRE and Postgraduate University Admissions, Master's Programs and the Graduate Record Examination, Master's Programs Admissions, Master of Science in Computer Science, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Master of Science Degrees, Master's Programs, College and University Admissions, College Advice",41,"Note: You can follow my Quora blog for more info about higher education abroad: https://studyabroadgre.quora.com/SOP Evaluation here: SOP Evaluation procedure by Mihir on Study AbroadPS: Before I answer anything else, I will directly answer the question asked by most of the applicants: Can my GRE compensate for poor GPA/CGPA? The answer is NO. Now read everything below:GRE is not a big selection criterion for MS programs. The selection of a candidate for MS program is a 2 stage process:Screening process by the admin department: This screening process goes something like, there is a list of cut-off score or threshold values for certain selection criterion. For example, all students with GRE above 310 will be cleared, or all students with CGPA above 8.0/10.0 will be selected etc. This limit is not very strict and is flexible. TOEFL is one such criterion that will fall only and only in this screening process and not evaluated for the next one, unless you are going for TA/RA, in which case they need to evaluate your English language capability (still it will be least importance).Selection process by Adcom: In this process, you will be judged on your GPA, GRE score, SOP, LOR etc and is highly flexible. A student with great acads but not so good GRE can be selected over a student with perfect GRE score and average acads. It depends on your whole application file BUT certain parameters weigh more than the others.Usually the selection criterion goes like this (in descending order):Academic GPA/CGPA/%age as well as ranking in your batchUndergrad universitySOPResearch ex/Work exGRELORThese other factors will vary from case to case:Final Year ProjectInternship and papersCo/Extra-curricularProf LettingProblems people might face:BacklogsYear GapPlagiarismSome people may disagree, but this is what I personally think, seen and experienced.SELECTION CRITERION:1. Acads are the most important parameters:Your GPA or %age is the prime deciding factor. If you are topper in your batch and have shown outstanding academic performance, the chances are that you will be a preferable candidate for the program. Backlogs will damage your admission chances drastically. Although you can still find cases with a lot of backlogs and people still get admission in the university. Read this link at the end of the answer those who have low confidence in this area (he had 55 backlogs; read the whole thread/story).2. Undergrad University:If you belong to one of the top universities in your country, and you have descent acads, then you have good chances of admission. BEWARE, if you are from a top university BUT your acads are weak you will have a disadvantage compared to a student who is from a descent ranking university but high GPA. That's how it goes, 'Be on the top where ever you are', that's something to be learned not just for MS admission process but for life as well. :D3. Statement of Purpose (SOP):I personally feel that SOP is a big deciding factor in your admission. You can be a lot of different by writing an excellent SOP. Your SOP will say a lot of thing about you silently that a strong profile will never be able to speak out. SOP tells your attitude, your ambition, your clarity of thought and your personality. These sometime overweight excellent profiles. This video will help you realize the importance of a good SOP (UMass Amherst Admission Committee):Also if you want to read more about it, check the link at the end of the answer.4. Work/Research ex, GRE and LOR:I will prefer not to rank them in a strict order because they will depend on the type of program you are applying to. If you are applying for a research based program, your research/work ex and LOR will be of higher value than GRE, but if may be it is not a specifically research based MS program, then if is possible that GRE may matter more. A good GRE score will certainly help. Score above 310 is considered okay-okay.... may be descent... 320+ is desirable and good... 330+ is excellent. AWA also matters and 3.0+ is almost like mandatory... 4/4+ is good. Work/research ex is helpful not just during MS application process but also after completing your MS when job hunting. A relevant work ex is recommended and good, but if you have work ex in a different field than what you are going to study, no promises can be made if it will help.If you are interested in doing some research work and gain some research experience before applying for MS you can apply as RA at IITs under a prof. Here are some details on that: http://www.edulix.com/forum/show... LORs are important mainly for PhD programs. they do add some weight to the application, but only if a prominent professor from a premier institute or a high ranking official from work place writes it. It is also important to send the LOR only using the official university/company mail id of the prof/boss, else although acceptable, they will add ZERO points to application.Finally I will add the uncertainty factor: LUCK. :D Although they say ""The harder I work, the luckier I get.""Update: To include all the rest of the factors involved in the admission process.THESE FACTORS WILL VARY FROM CASE TO CASE:1. Final Year Project (FYP):Check this too: Mihir Gupta's answer to Which kind of project should I do so that I can show it in my resume for MS in US? This is also one of the important deciding factors for admission, especially for one applying for MS with thesis. It will demonstrate your ability to convert your theoretical know-how into practical engineering knowledge. Also if your project is good enough, you can get a paper out of it and publish it. Sometimes, if he admission process involves an interview with a prof who is willing to take you as RA/TA, then the FYP is very important as mos of the interview questions will be from the project.2. Internships and Papers:Internship that are usually undertaken by B.Tech students in 3rd or 4th year matter only if they project assigned to them is a good one and it they do it from a reputed firm like IISC, DRDO, or some big pvt companies. Here the important thing will also be to work for a longer time as one month's internship won't be of any use. If you work for a minimum 3 months and are also able to impress your boss such that he is willing to give you recommendation, that will be the best case scene. It is also possible to try score internships abroad in a university or a company. They are a big plus for overall profile.Research papers published during the final year project or internship will help those who wish to go for MS with thesis option but not very much for students aiming for MS without thesis (MEngg; 1 yr course). The impact factor of the journal you have published your work in will be considered, but not much as adcom do not expect a high quality research work from an undergrad unless it is a direct PhD application.3. Co/Extra-curricular:These activities will not offer you any major advantage, but will make your resume/CV look bright and show that you are involved in activities other than acads. If you do not have good acads and bad GRE, then these activities will be of zero importance, on the other hand if you profile is good and you have done some nice activities, then these will provide you an edge over student who has profile similar to yours.4. Prof-Letting:This is useful only when you think you have good admission chances and that you want to work under a prof as RA/TA under a prof during MS. For this the credentials responsible will differ. Of course acads will still hold importance, but after that will come your work ex, research ex, papers, project and LOR. There is a method required to contact profs of the desired university. You can read all about it in the link at the end of the answer.PROBLEMS PEOPLE MIGHT FACE:1. Backlogs:Don't feel disappointed if you have had a few backlogs. Although your list of universities will be a bit different compared to the one who had no backlogs, but you still do have a good chance to succeed. For this I will again link you to this guy who had 55 backlogs and still got admit and visa as well. All you need is strong motivation, hard work and will power.Backlog in a core subject, the one you are selecting your specialization for MS will hurt bad, but if it is in an unrelated subject, it will probably not be that bad.2. Year Gap:If you completed your UG in 2012 and did nothing till June 2013, then it will be called a year gap. If you worked for a major part of that year (6/6+ months) then its not probably not a year gap.Some year gaps are acceptable. Like you took a year off to work in an NGO or may be for (Teach For India) TFI or something like that, then it is acceptable.The other case may be that you were preparing for GATE or any other exam. This will be a negative factor for your profile unless you did great in that exam and that exam somehow added to your profile (like good GATE score is valuable for German universities).The third case can be that you were search for job and by the end you decided to take GRE for MS. This will have really bad effect on your profile, unless you can cover it with something valuable you might have done side by side.3. Plagiarism:This is kind of an indirect factor that may affect your chances of admit, BUT if found guilty, you may not just receive reject from the university you applied to but also from other universities you are going to apply to. Plagiarism is a serious issue when it comes to higher studies. So my advice will be DO NOT try to copy anything.So if you find my answers helpful, do endorse me for topics.LINKS (For any help use Edulix - Premier Site for Scholars - 'Education Crowd-Sourced'.

More importantly, once you achieve something around 167 and above in quant and 160 and above in Verbal, even GRE does not matter. These days a lot of Indian students are applying with GRE scores of 325+, so I do not think GRE will pull you up, unless you get 335+ (but anything less than 315 will pull you down).What matters --1) CGPA (higher the CGPA better are your chances. Anything with 9 pointer above will be a good bet).2) Rank (if your university of college gives you a recognised rank then say your CGPA is 8, but still you are second in class, then it shall help your case).3) Name of the institute. Better recongized is your institute, better are your chances. For example: names such as IIT, NIT or BITS do hold value.4) Internships -- If you have internship at IIT or some other good US university, then you have brighter chances of achieving an admission. If you have internships at top multinationals (such as for CS guys microsoft, IBM labs, intel, samsung and so on) then also you can secure a good MS program. Your internship at a startup can also help you, if the work done is good. The main point to understand is at the end of the day, work matters.5) If you have research papers or some academic awards or grants, then it will help you pass through a good MS program. Publishing researh papers does not mean that a person publishes 10 papers, but the conference or journal is not even recognized. Even if you have a single paper, but from a reputed organization, then it is far better than ten.6) Contacts with foreign univeristy profesor. If you have any interaction with the professor of the college of your choice, then you have an edge.7) SOP -- A golden rule, write the truth and not stories. State your achivements and your study plans, group to join and professor to work with.PS: Thanx to Nikhil Prabhu for edits","Dear GRE aspirant,Do you think that modest GRE scores and backlogs would hold back a profile? No, definitely not.To help you in understanding this claim better, I have a chart* with three GREedge alumni with modest GRE scores and backlogs.*Data obtained from GREedge’s Admission Counselling TeamSo, these profiles are indeed testimony to the fact that apart from your GRE score, a host of other factors determine the status of your admits. Now that you know this, I’m sure you are wondering what these factors are. Based on my experience as the Co-founder of GREedge, I would like to share them with you.Before you get to these factors, you must know the application process to know how universities shortlist candidates. This would give you a background of what universities look for in a prospective candidate. A general flow of the application process would look like this:Over the evaluation process, Universities, in general, look to scrutinize you on a holistic basis.The evaluation begins by examining your CGPA and a host of other factors. Some of these factors include the scores of your admission requirement tests, Letter of Recommendation, Statement of Purpose/essay among the rest. So, clearly understand what universities use as a sieve in screening your application.Most universities have some common filters. Some of them include:Competitive GPA: Once your application package reaches the university, it is immediately forwarded to the Graduate Department. The first scrutiny that is made on the application is the “test of your GPA”. Your GPA speaks volumes about your application. If you are a rank-holder or if you have a consistent academic track record, then you can definitely expect some weightage. Countries like the U.S. and Germany place a huge emphasis on GPAs. For example, Georgia Tech requires an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better to pursue a Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (MS-HCI). Though you cannot completely balance your profile with high GPA, a consistent and competitive GPA will definitely add substantial value to your profile. In addition to your GPA, the following academic factors will give your application an edge too.TOEFL/IELTS: A great deal of emphasis is placed on your IELTS or TOEFL score apart from your GRE score. Most universities require a good TOEFL or IELTS score. For example, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, requires a minimum of 90 points in the Internet-based TOEFL (iBT). Georgia Tech, on the other hand, for the MS-HCI program, requires a minimum of 100 in TOEFL. Universities emphasize on TOEFL/IELTS scores to determine the status of TA/RA. Further, IELTS and TOEFL scores are also taken into account in determining the quantum of your scholarships and fellowships. Keep it a point to research on the minimum requirements. A TOEFL score over 100 or IELTS score over 7 will indeed add value to your profile.Letter of Recommendation: The basic purpose of the Letter of Recommendation is to get a person to vouch for your credentials. This, no doubt, adds value to your profile. Ensure that you get two or three Letters of Recommendation. The Letter of Recommendation must come from someone who has been associated with you. It can be your university professor or your senior at workplace. Further, it will also add value if the person who recommends you has a PhD. So, make it a point to get a commendable Letter of Recommendation and this will indeed boost the value of your profile.Statement of Purpose: Your SOP is just like your personal interview with the Admission Committee. Convey all that you want the Admission Committee to know about your profile.Your Statement of Purpose must be genuine and convincing. Make it a point to highlight the drive behind your Master’s program. Answer all possible questions, such as:1. Your degree of interest in your chosen field 2. What made you apply for the particular university 3. Why did you choose the particular courseEnsure that you don’t leave out any relevant information. Make it a point to highlight all your academic achievements and professional goals. Always remember that your SOP is as good as an interview. So, draft a compelling SOP that would persuade the Admission Committee to consider your profile.You can keep the following guidelines in your mind while you draft your SOP:Paper Publication and Research Work: Having a good number of paper publications and research work will show that you had been in touch with the academic community. Ensure that you have your papers published in international journals. Also, if you had participated in international conferences, ensure that you highlight them. A good number of paper publications and research work will indeed add points to your applications. So, even if you have not published any papers until now, get started with it. Paper publications and research work add a high impact to your profile.Work Experience: Work experience will be a crucial factor in adding value to your profile. Two or three years of relevant experience will add precious points to your profile. Further, it will also be a good source for your Letter of Recommendation. Though work experience is not a mandatory requirement, relevant work experience in a reputed company will add value.Project and Internships: Your project and internships will definitely be considered while your application is evaluated. The degree of your practical knowledge and research acumen can be demonstrated through projects and internships. So, highlight your projects and internships. Make it a point to highlight your projects and internships in an appropriate manner.Apart from these factors, you can certainly highlight your co-curricular and extracurricular activities too. They will also be considered since they throw light on your overall personality.Though there is no set order of priority in evaluating a candidate’s profile, you can indeed make a huge impact if you can balance out your profile. So, have a balanced profile and try not to compromise on any element. Remember that universities look for candidates with a holistic profile and not someone with unilateral strength. This will indeed make all the difference.All the best!","Studying abroad: it’s something we all have dreamt about at some point, isn’t it? The prospect of moving to a strange country, meeting new friends and living independently cannot fail to excite anyone. It really comes as no surprise, then, that the Ministry of External Affairs reported that as many as 7.5 lakh Indian students are studying abroad in 2018, with the numbers only predicted to rise in the coming years.With the US and Canada retaining top spots as the preferred study abroad destinations, (with 2.1 lakh and 1 lakh Indian students respectively) it goes without saying, then, that the competition for seats at universities in these two countries can get incredibly stiff.eBook Download: USA or Canada - What’s the right choice for MSAdd to that the high costs of application fees, and it becomes paramount to ensure that your application quality is top-notch and helps you put your best foot forward.

Here’s a glimpse at some of the top Canadian universities that accept GRE scores, and their respective GRE requirements:Download the ebook GRE Cutoff Scores for Top 35 UniversitiesTOEFL/IELTS score: Both the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) are accepted at universities in Canada, Germany and the US, and seek to assess your command and fluency over the English language. Your ability to read, write, speak and listen comfortably in English will be gauged, and a score will be given accordingly. In countries apart from USA, this lays a very important role in the admission committee’s mind as it gives a reflection of your communication abilities. In the TOEFL iBT (Internet Based Test), each of the four sections will be marked between 0 to 30 for a possible total score of 120. On the IELTS, marks are allotted between 0 to 9, with 0.5 increments. You will be given an individual band score for each skill, in addition to an overall score. A good TOEFL score is anything between 100 to 120, while a score of 7.5 and above is generally regarded as a good IELTS score. While the IELTS enjoys a worldwide acceptance, the TOEFL is generally used in the US, although all American universities also accept IELTS scores. Owing to its versatility, IELTS scores are valid in over 10,000 institutions and universities worldwide, including countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany.Download eBook: A Definitive Guide for IELTS hereAcademic GPA: One of the most crucial factors that impact your admission chances would be your GPA referred to as CGPA or percentages in a lot of Indian Institutions. Given the fact that a student’s CGPA does not completely reflect the student’s potential but to a certain extent about the faculty, college & competition in the university, it’s seen as a relative criterion. To explain in simple words, your GPA is considered as good or bad depending on your topper’s GPA. Also, each country requires your to convert your GPA to scale of 4. Read about how to convert your GPA for USA, Canada & Germany here>>Statement of Purpose: The Statement of Purpose, or the SOP, is a crucial ingredient to a successful application. Because universities abroad typically receive hundreds of applications with similar credentials, your SOP is your one chance to showcase your individuality and your dreams and aspirations, and set yourself apart from your peers. The SOP is commonly thought to be a replacement for the personal interview, and for that reason, it is crucial that you nail it just right. For the lowdown on how to craft the perfect winning SOP, make sure you checkout our top tips and tricks!Download ebook: How To Craft A Winning SOP >>Letters of Recommendation: Written by former professors or employers, the LOR is an important testament to your intellectual and personal character, and is essentially a promise from one professor to another that you are an intelligent, diligent student, and deserving of an admit. Ideally, you should get LORs from professors who have supervised your thesis or research project, Heads of Departments, or from professors who have taught you and known you for a substantial period of time, especially if they are well-known in their field and have published extensively. You can also submit LORs from employers, although it is recommended you only do this if you’ve been out of college for a few years.Work and research experience: As a fresh undergraduate, you aren’t typically expected to have work experience apart from the usual internship or voluntary work. However, if you do have such experience, make sure to highlight it in your CV and SOP. Most applicants tend to apply to graduate school straight after finishing undergrad, and view work experience as a filler, but work experience not only allows you to gain a fresh perspective on the world, but also facilitates the development of new, life-defining skills, and the ability to work in and lead diverse groups of people, all of which are paramount to graduate applications. As far as research is concerned, do remember, universities in the US are vastly different from Indian ones, especially because of the onus they place on research and development, to the extent where applicants with a relatively lower GPA have won admits to top schools based purely on their excellent research experience in the past. If you have substantial research experience, it would be a good idea to get your research supervisors to write you a reference letter, and also issue you any relevant certificates. Both research and work experience are especially beneficial in making up for any shortfalls in you GPA or GRE scores, and also in getting scholarships and other aid.What are the common mistakes students make while applying?Time, as they say, is money, and this is especially true for MS applications, where every single day is of prime importance. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that you plan your application well in advance and follow a proper timeline so that you don’t find yourself floundering for time. So what are some of the mistakes that trip up study abroad aspirants? Let’s take a look:Starting GRE preparation late: Your GRE, as we mentioned, is one of the most important building blocks of your application, so ideally, you must give yourself sufficient time to start preparing for the test, so you can identify your weak points and work on them properly. You also need to have enough time so that if you find your GRE scores unsatisfactory, you can choose to rewrite it.Inability to shortlist universities: Of course, Harvard, MIT and Caltech are the dream of millions, but realistically, is your profile compatible with the stringent requirements of these universities? Before applying, draw up a list of 8-10 universities you would like to attend, based on criteria such as GRE requirements, tuition fee, acceptance rate, past admits, alum profiles, cultural & research field compatibility with faculty etc. Remember, you will be spending quite a bit on application fees, so make sure you don’t waste time and money on schools that are unrealistically out of your league.Download The SELECT Strategy to Shortlist Universities eBOOK hereLacking the relevant details about deadlines and requirements: Universities in the US and Canada are extremely strict about the application deadlines: for instance, for fall admit, applications usually close in the first week of December of the previous year. Many aspirants often fail to take cognizance of deadlines, or neglect to send in their applications keeping in mind the time it would take to reach the US. A good idea is to note down the application deadlines of the various programs you want to apply to, well in advance. Do remember that if you are applying for a scholarship, deadlines are typically earlier. Additionally, many schools have an early bird round, which closes much before the usual deadlines. Applying in an early bird round greatly improves your chances at an offer letter, so if you’re ready, you can send in your applications right in time for that!Consulting unofficial/inaccurate/random websites: The internet is a quagmire of information, and it is easy to fall into a trap of misinformation if you are not careful. While researching for application information, be sure to stick to only the university’s official websites. If you are still doubtful or have any questions, be sure to write to the admissions help desk of the university to be sure.Sending an incomplete or inadequate application: Applying overseas is not as straightforward as applying to universities in India: there is a lot more paperwork involved, such as healthcare insurance, transcripts, and visas, and in order to prevent your application from being summarily rejected, you need to ensure that your application package is complete. Overwhelmed?Don’t worry. Please find the MS application checklist right below to help you plan your entire application process.Download the eBOOK “MS Admit: The Application Checklist” hereWe hope you found this information useful, and now have some clarity on the various building blocks to ensuring an offer letter to your dream university.

GRE,What is it like for an Indian student to pursue an MS or PhD from a US or European university?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-it-like-for-an-Indian-student-to-pursue-an-MS-or-PhD-from-a-US-or-European-university,"European University Institute, College and University Experience Advice, Undergraduate Studies, Higher Education in the United States of America, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), The College and University Experience, Academic and Educational Advice",27,"Well there it depends on a lot of factors. Most importantly it depends on where you did your undergrad studies in India. If you belong to an IIT or a top NIT you may not find the teaching up to the mark. Most of the time the lectures are very superficial and deep understanding of subject matter is not ensured by the professors. They expect students to do a lot of self study. In France, the lectures are of 2 hours duration which is very rare in India. I can hardly concentrate after 1 hr. So, ensure that you sleep well in the night before going to a class in the morning. But you will feel good about a lot of things here. Everyone is punctual. I have been here for 2 months and I have never seen a professor come late to class. Till date not a single lecture has been cancelled. The laboratories are super awesome. You will find that each lab has developed its own tools and software to carry out the practicals. The lab experiments are very close to the industry standards. For example this semester I have a lab on study of OSEK Real time systems which is being used presently in designing the electronic control system of automobiles. The assignments are really challenging. Not a single question copied from any standard textbook. Another important thing, people here pay a lot of attention on presentation of subject matter. They expect the assignments to be well written with excellent explanation. Hand written reports are generally discouraged and students are really good when it comes to using tools like Latex, Prezi and MS office. So, if one is clever with concepts but cannot reproduce it with the same clarity in his reports then he/she is likely to get lesser grades.Assignments are very meticulously checked by the professor himself (not by his PhD student). This is something that one will not find even in the best IITs.Group work is highly encouraged. I see people forming groups and studying late into the night in the university labs. The professors are very very approachable. Sometimes as approachable as a friend. You can contact anytime and clarify your doubts. If they cannot , they usually send you handouts and books on your email to help you understand the topic.Most importantly you never have to cram formulas here, everything is provided in the question paper. You just have to use them. Most of the exams are open book , but questions are difficult. I never found any standard text book problem in the exams. Past year questions are seldom repeated.","I feel delighted to be doing MS in US. Few of the reasons are1) Excellent teaching: Here professors always try to teach courses to let it be attractive to students as well as Industry. They take it as their responsibility that the concepts are well understood by students. So, a lot of interesting homework and assignment follows hard topics. It is a pain to do them in between semester when there are lots of them to be done but in the end you feel good that you have learnt and applied something which would have been categorized as ""geeky"" back home and friends would have boasted of leaving it. Here, after the end of semester you feel really great to have done things which you were scared of doing. Especially if any subjects require programming, you will soon be proud that you wrote your own code with complex things inside it right from scratch. Everyone'e implementation would be different. You learn lot of new things discussing over that.2) Passionate students: In every class here, mostly all of the students in that  class are taking that course because they want to and not because they have to. So, teacher doesn't have to face impassionate crowd who wants to learn the minimum and try to get classes cancelled to the maximum. Also there is no attendance here. Infact, in all my classes attendance was never ever discussed. Also, in case you have to miss some classes because of some reason, professor will try within his limits to help you.3) Excellent courses: Here universities are huge. They have lots of department and each of them doing genuine work and most of the time great work. You can take course from any department upto a certain number of credits. This gives an option of joining music, arts etc. which wouldn't have been possible in universities in India. Also every departments have new courses coming up as per trends of Industry or research so you can always enjoy the latest.4) Provision of Teaching Assistants and Graders: Few of the reason for not giving homeworks or giving bad quality homework in India is that very few teachers and subjects have position of TAs and graders. When teacher can offload this trivial tasks to others, he/she can put more effort on course.5) Quality of professors: Here, for a professor to be promoted, he has to do good research and bring in funds. This promotes quality in his work. Here professors are those people who know their subject very well and have worked years on it doing something new. So, here the best people become professors atleast at the college level. In India, its mostly the reverse, many people become professors because they couldn't do anything else. So, they end up teaching the same things for decades in same way, sometimes themselves not knowing details of it and the latest development in their field. After seeing how the undergrads work here, I have developed a great respect for them. I believe even if their GPA is 2/4 here, they would actually know their subject better then possibly an 8/10 pointer in India. This is not just in engineering, I have seen even History students here have to do a lot of work themselves and not just copying. So, anything which is taught here is taught here with the best intention.I believe this is a very big reason why America leads in innovation. They may have very few under-graduates than India but whoever it is, they are far better than combined knowledge of many Indian under-graduates.One thing which I disliked here: Here most of the students write their exam papers and homeworks in a very ugly fashion. In fact it is so bad that atleast half of the class would get zero if the paper was checked in an Indian college or school. Here they write as if it is the teachers job to find out where the answer is in the sheet.One important point, I am doing MS in a university which counts in top 25 in US and so my analysis is based on what I see here. Here average GPA to get in undergrad courses is A (3.98/4).It may be possible that lowly ranked universities here may degrade to levels in India but I am not sure about it. From what I can understand, atleast top 100 colleges here would be within limits of top 10 of India.","I will answer this question from the point of view of an undergraduate and I am going to remain anonymous as I a still studying with these folks so bear with me. Due to the nature of my studies, most of classes are at the graduate level because undergraduate classes cannot satisfy my degree requirements and consequently I have a fair amount of interaction with Indian students who have come to the U.S. for their M.S. studies.The one thing that I have seen is that adventurousness seems to be an all time low for most of the students and this goes as far as them feeling totally helpless when in fact they should be relieved that they do not have to speak in a language other than English. 1. If you can, choose housing that is right between an ""Indian Enclave"" and your school. This will help you in meeting non-Indians and will make you more sociable and will make your study period more fun.2. When it comes to choosing classes, the best person to turn to is your advisor. Please do not go to your seniors, if you want to call them that, to help you make your schedule. 3. I understand that being in a foreign land can be a bit isolating and you feel the need to interact with fellow Indians; this should not mean that you ignore life outside your social circle. 4. I chose a totally new academic line and for me it has not been easy but I rolled the dice and it ended up working out for me just fine. Have the courage and the curiosity to explore new things and at the same time define your values. 5. Yes GPA will matter no matter what but if you use your time wisely and do a lot of projects by working with profs in your school it will give you skills, establish a professional network and possibly be able to get you to an interview. 6. Don't be sensitive. Indians have a terrible reputation of being overly sensitive to any criticism of India, it's culture or it's people. Please understand that each and every person has a right to their opinion and that does not mean that they are racist. 7. Copying assignments and code is not going to get you far and non-Indian students as well as faculty know this too well. If you happen to find yourself in such a group please stay away from them. A ""B"" earned through your own work is much better than an ""A"" earned by copying.8. African Americans (blacks) are not criminals and please don't say things like ""kaaliya"" or ""chocolate"" when they are around. They know what that means and it is very degrading. Same goes for fellow Asian students, please don't say things like ""chinkies"" and ""ching-chong-ting-tong"" it is highly un-professional and only makes the entire Indian student body look bad. At the end of the day, your degree will be what you make of it. Also, I am an Indian in case readers have their doubts. Enjoy your stay and welcome to the United States!","From IITKGP (BSc + MSc) to Ghent University (PhD). Some things that I observed:You can treat a professor like an equal here. Talk to them openly about everything, go out for drinks with them, and crack jokes. There were only a couple of professors in IIT KGP with whom I could imagine doing all that. Graduate students here are on average way more smart than the undergrad students and not the other way around, as it is in IITs. Computer science is not the most sought after branch to study in a university, at least not here in Belgium. The smartest people usually end up taking maths or engineering. In many university courses group projects and group activities are a norm while I rarely saw that in India. Also, I have heard that copying of assignments doesn't happen much. In India I had never heard of or faced a situation where someone says ""Oh, you are studying maths! You must be really smart."" while here it seems like a very common thing to say. One of the questions that I posted a few months after coming here: What are some good ways to respond to ""Oh! You must be really smart!"" when you tell someone that you are doing a PhD in math?Europeans love their holidays! Sometimes a little too much. I don't mind if we are allowed to take 35 days off in an year and to not work at all on weekends but it gets annoying when you feel like you are obliged to do so. Your peers expect from you that you would never work on a weekend and they treat you as a weirdo if you do. The university deducts your holiday money for the next year if you do not officially take 35 days off this year! I work when I want to work, and luckily in the work that I am doing right now I can afford to do so. The shops do not open on Sundays! That is among the most annoying things that I have faced. People assume that if you are a vegetarian then you must eat only salad. Non-vegetarianism is the norm and not the other way around. Things are changing a little now. But I miss all the easily accessible and diverse vegetarian food, gol gappe, samosa, pav bhaji, dosa, uttapam, pakode, paranthe, ... :'("
GRE,What is the key to scoring more than 160 points on the verbal section of the new GRE?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-the-key-to-scoring-more-than-160-points-on-the-verbal-section-of-the-new-GRE,"Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Exams and Tests",22,"I gave the GRE in August 2013 and scored 335 (Q: 170, V: 165) . This is what worked for me : 1. Reading the newspaper daily : This is a must. I used to read the entire thing, even the news that didn't interest me at all. I underlined all the words I didn't know and later wrote them down in a diary with a sentence example to remember how they're used. Reading the paper is also good practice for the comprehension section, it helps in increasing your 'flow' .2. Reading a lot in general :   Try reading books of genres you don't particularly like. I , for example, read some of the classics which bored me to death but eventually helped a great deal with the comprehensions. Some GRE comprehensions can be really dull and you need to develop the sense to read things you're not interested in.3. Cramming a high frequency wordlist    Buy some practice modules like Barron's and try cramming at least 30-40 words a day. And DON'T do this orally. Write everything down. Revise the words you learnt yesterday before  starting with today's words. And at the end of the week, revise all the words you crammed that week. You're bound to forget no matter how much time you spend on learning them. Use some tricks to remember the words. It can be frustrating but don't get disheartened. There are always some words which no matter what you do, you just can't memorize. Make a separate list of these words and religiously 'worship' them everyday.You can also learn some root words like 'cog', which is related to the brain. So COGnizance is knowledge and to COGitate is to think. This'll help you surmise the meaning of words you don't know directly. 4. Most of all, PRACTICE Lots and lots of practice is needed if you really want a good score. Make sure you have plenty of practice material. You can find some free material online as well. Don't forget to TIME YOURSELF. This is very, very important. If the verbal section is of 25 minutes duration , you should set the timer to 20 minutes. You might not be able to complete the section within this duration in the beginning, but trust me, eventually you will. Train your brain to work under pressure. That's all the advice I can give. This won't be easy and you'll have your moments of frustration, but you have to keep pushing yourself out of your comfort zone if you really want to achieve something.","Thanks for asking me to answer! :) I will tell you what I feel is the key to get 160+ in verbal section. Some of my friends have also followed this, and most of them have got 160+ so, I think there must be something right about this.You need to do improve the following skills, depending on the time you have left. (See my answer to Is three months sufficient to prepare for the GRE?)Vocabulary :You need not learn thousands of words, but good vocabulary always translates into a good score. Learn the most frequent words (Barrons 333, Kaplans 400..) and then make yourself familiar with the jargon in NYTimes, Washington Post etc.,Use it or Lose it. You can improve the vocabulary only by using them. Reading Comprehension Skills :Practice a lot. This will be significantly helpful for your graduate study as well. Use online MSTs as well as sites like RC Practice Utility By Lagnajeet Pradhan. I found the book Manhattan Reading Comprehension succinct and helpful. You should look at that at least once.Sentence Equivalence and Text Completion SkillsThe key to score more in SE and TC is smart guesswork and reasoning.

Don't add too much weight to the score. Just enjoy the process and practise a lot before you take the actual GRE.All the best! :)","How to Achieve more than 160 on the Verbal section (Quora)  Getting above 160 on the GRE verbal is going to be very challenging, especially if you’ve never been much of a reading person. That doesn’t mean such an increase is impossible. Indeed, I’ve seen quite a few students go from the lower 150’s to well over 160 (and a few who’ve gotten there after starting off at a sub-150).  In each instance, the person has displayed laser-like focus and remarkable resilience. Yet those traits alone will not help you crack the 160 mark. You’ll need to keep the following in mind:  1.   Understand how vocabulary works in context The GRE verbal is mainly about vocabulary. Even the RC section often relies on your ability to know a vocabulary word (words such as perfunctoriness have show up in answer choices). At the same time, simply knowing the rote definition of a word isn’t going to get you very far.  Instead you must learn how words function in context. A great way to do this is by looking up example sentences online. For instance, let’s say your flashcard defines perfunctory as performed merely as a typical duty; superficial. You can ingrain that definition into your head and still be totally flustered if perfunctory shows up as one of the answers in a Text Completion. That’s because you really aren’t equipped—by that definition alone—to know if perfunctory fits on the blank.  On the other hand, if you go to Wordnikand read several example sentences, or use flashcards with well-thought out example sentences (Manhattan GRE (MGRE) and Magoosh, come to mind), then you are far more likely to get a grasp of how to use perfunctory in a sentence. (I should mention that I work for Magoosh!).  And that’s the key to success on the GRE verbal: knowing not just the denotative (dictionary/flashcard definition) but also the connotative definition (the ways—both figurative and literal—that a word can function in a scholarly context).   2.   Read voraciously, and outside of your comfort zone Your reading brain is a muscle. If it has been out of use—or you’ve mainly been reading your friends’ tweets or FB updates—then that muscle has most likely atrophied. Doing dull and dry GRE reading passages will definitely snap it back into shape. However, you want to exercise that muscle throughout the day, and doing only GRE reading passages will try even the doughtiest person’s sanity. The New Yorker and The New York Timesare great places to start.  If you need something even more challenging, I highly recommend Arts & Letters Daily, which will definitely take you out of your comfort zone. The articles are scholarly, dense, and challenging. And remember—whenever you encounter words you don’t know, look those words up and try to get a better sense of how they function in context.    3.   Use material that is as difficult or more difficult than what you’ll see test day There are quite a few test prep companies out there with material that is much easier than what you’ll see on the actual GRE. Unless you are just starting to prep, doing such passages won’t help much. And if you are going for the 160+, then they may very well hurt you.  Instead, use prep material that is as difficult, if not more difficult than what you’ll see test day. The LSAT guides, for one, are great troves of formidably opaque and ridiculously recondite reading passages. Manhattan GRE prep's  online tests contain Text Completions and Sentence Equivalence questions with very twisted sentence structure. Some of the Magoosh TC’s (according to our customers, at least) are harder than what you’ll see test day.    4.   Build up your stamina You may be able to whip through a tough passage and a set of daunting Text Completions with no problem. Yet those very questions that you breezed through will seem a lot more difficult when you are sitting in the testing center after three straight hours of GRE.  Make sure you do plenty of mock tests (math included!) to build up your stamina.   Finally, as I mentioned in the beginning, you need focus and perseverance. Learning all these words is like learning an entirely new language. But by following the above, you can break into the rarefied realm of the 160+ GRE verbal score.","You'd be able to get that score in verbal if you are into reading , maybe right from your childhood. This was what helped me when I took my GRE last year. However, if you don't really like reading, you might have to work hard for a few months at least to get a feel of the type of questions they ask on the GRE.  You need to work simultaneously on vocabulary and reading comprehension. Your goal should be to minimize the time you need to solve the sentence  completion and text completion questions, thereby maximizing the time available for reading comprehension. Reading comprehension is where you'll be really tested, even if you think you have a great command over English. Use the Barron's word list. Don't try to mindlessly cram words everyday. This might just help you on the exam but not in the long run. I used to pick up the list when I was free and I never got bored reading about words. Try to pick out roots from the words as you go along. For example ' mem' ( Memory, memoir, memento, memorial, memorandum etc.) Imagine situations where you'd use the words and create sentences in your head using the word you learnt. Create strong associations with words. Associate the words' meanings with familiar entities. If you can't remember what a 'pugilist' is, try remembering that ' Million Dollar Baby' was about a pugilist. Images worked for me , so you can try to associate vivid, familiar images with words that are hard to remember. Use flash cards. Try to read about how a word came into being just the way it is. I would recommend Norman Lewis's Word Power Made Easy. Although I didn't read it completely, it was what made my learning about words experience funny and enjoyable.  An important advice for all verbal questions is : Exploit the context. You'd not be asked a word's meaning on the GRE without being given a context for that word. You can try to find out the tone of the sentence surrounding a difficult word and then at least partially guess the meaning of the word. I cannot stress on this enough: Practice. RCs can be nightmare if you are not prepared for them. The more difficult ones that I had on my GRE had a peculiar quality to them. The meaning and the conclusions were very elusive and I was frequently tempted to change my answers. I had to read the passages once, twice, thrice to understand the nuances. I had solved a large number of passages during my preparation but still I thought more would've helped. Try to solve many, many passages. Finally, don't forget to take the two official GRE practice tests that come with the CD. Your score in them will most likely reflect the score you'd be getting on the real test. I scored 330 and 332 on those tests and my actual GRE score turned out to be 334.    *I will update this answer soon adding more details to it*"

(I should mention that I work for Magoosh!).  And that’s the key to success on the GRE verbal: knowing not just the denotative (dictionary/flashcard definition) but also the connotative definition (the ways—both figurative and literal—that a word can function in a scholarly context).   2.   Read voraciously, and outside of your comfort zone Your reading brain is a muscle. If it has been out of use—or you’ve mainly been reading your friends’ tweets or FB updates—then that muscle has most likely atrophied. Doing dull and dry GRE reading passages will definitely snap it back into shape. However, you want to exercise that muscle throughout the day, and doing only GRE reading passages will try even the doughtiest person’s sanity. The New Yorker and The New York Timesare great places to start.  If you need something even more challenging, I highly recommend Arts & Letters Daily, which will definitely take you out of your comfort zone. The articles are scholarly, dense, and challenging. And remember—whenever you encounter words you don’t know, look those words up and try to get a better sense of how they function in context.    3.   Use material that is as difficult or more difficult than what you’ll see test day There are quite a few test prep companies out there with material that is much easier than what you’ll see on the actual GRE. Unless you are just starting to prep, doing such passages won’t help much. And if you are going for the 160+, then they may very well hurt you.  Instead, use prep material that is as difficult, if not more difficult than what you’ll see test day. The LSAT guides, for one, are great troves of formidably opaque and ridiculously recondite reading passages. Manhattan GRE prep's  online tests contain Text Completions and Sentence Equivalence questions with very twisted sentence structure. Some of the Magoosh TC’s (according to our customers, at least) are harder than what you’ll see test day.    4.   Build up your stamina You may be able to whip through a tough passage and a set of daunting Text Completions with no problem. Yet those very questions that you breezed through will seem a lot more difficult when you are sitting in the testing center after three straight hours of GRE.  Make sure you do plenty of mock tests (math included!) to build up your stamina.   Finally, as I mentioned in the beginning, you need focus and perseverance. Learning all these words is like learning an entirely new language. But by following the above, you can break into the rarefied realm of the 160+ GRE verbal score.","You'd be able to get that score in verbal if you are into reading , maybe right from your childhood. This was what helped me when I took my GRE last year. However, if you don't really like reading, you might have to work hard for a few months at least to get a feel of the type of questions they ask on the GRE.  You need to work simultaneously on vocabulary and reading comprehension. Your goal should be to minimize the time you need to solve the sentence  completion and text completion questions, thereby maximizing the time available for reading comprehension. Reading comprehension is where you'll be really tested, even if you think you have a great command over English. Use the Barron's word list. Don't try to mindlessly cram words everyday. This might just help you on the exam but not in the long run. I used to pick up the list when I was free and I never got bored reading about words. Try to pick out roots from the words as you go along. For example ' mem' ( Memory, memoir, memento, memorial, memorandum etc.) Imagine situations where you'd use the words and create sentences in your head using the word you learnt. Create strong associations with words. Associate the words' meanings with familiar entities. If you can't remember what a 'pugilist' is, try remembering that ' Million Dollar Baby' was about a pugilist. Images worked for me , so you can try to associate vivid, familiar images with words that are hard to remember. Use flash cards. Try to read about how a word came into being just the way it is. I would recommend Norman Lewis's Word Power Made Easy. Although I didn't read it completely, it was what made my learning about words experience funny and enjoyable.  An important advice for all verbal questions is : Exploit the context. You'd not be asked a word's meaning on the GRE without being given a context for that word. You can try to find out the tone of the sentence surrounding a difficult word and then at least partially guess the meaning of the word. I cannot stress on this enough: Practice. RCs can be nightmare if you are not prepared for them. The more difficult ones that I had on my GRE had a peculiar quality to them. The meaning and the conclusions were very elusive and I was frequently tempted to change my answers. I had to read the passages once, twice, thrice to understand the nuances. I had solved a large number of passages during my preparation but still I thought more would've helped. Try to solve many, many passages. Finally, don't forget to take the two official GRE practice tests that come with the CD. Your score in them will most likely reflect the score you'd be getting on the real test. I scored 330 and 332 on those tests and my actual GRE score turned out to be 334.    *I will update this answer soon adding more details to it*"
GRE,How do I score 320 in GRE in 20 days?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-score-320-in-GRE-in-20-days,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",17,"Making time would be your biggest concern so you will have to make time everyday or squeeze it into your busy schedule. You need to know the following about the GRE exam before you start your preparation.The GRE exam has 3 sections the analytical writing section, the verbal section and the quants section.The analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to your GRE score so you needn’t break your head about it.The Quants and verbal section are for 170 marks each. The quants is the scoring section and you should ideally be looking to get 170/170 in this section. Anything more than 160 is a great score when it comes to verbal.You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 minutes in each of these sections.Something that most of the people don’t know is that the GRE is actually only for 80 marks but the marks are awarded out of 320 so that we don’t assume that a person who scores a 40 is only half as good as a person who scores 80 so the scores are given on a scale of 260–340.You needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.Getting to the hardest part of it all PREPARATION:You needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.Most people find the Quants section easy so you should just be trying to brush up on your basic concepts. I would suggest you make your concepts concrete and don’t get carried away in cramming as many formulas as possible. Once you’re confident enough try taking up a mock test and see where you stand, analyze your mistakes and then go back to those topics and make sure that there isn’t an Achilles heel. Spend as little time as possible preparing for Quants and I don’t think it will take up a lot of time. 1 hour a day for a month and you should be good to go.The dicey section is the verbal section and it will definitely be the make or mar factor in your GRE since you may not be accustomed to the language used. The best way to prepare for the verbal section is to READ. The verbal section is predominantly vocabulary based and being thorough with vocabulary might just make the difference between you getting into an average institute or premier institute abroad.Please try to stick to the following schedule:Spend two hours each day for the verbal section of GRE and one hour for the Quants section.Make sure that your preparation doesn't take a back seat during the weekends or due to some occasion like a friend's birthday.GRE Quants in a week:People are usually comfortable with the Quants section. If you are from an engineering or science background, you are already leaps and bounds ahead of your peers.1.Brush up your concepts and make sure you don’t get carried away and cram as many formulas as you can.2. Make sure that you approach each problem logically .3. Cover all the bases and make sure to go through each topic since Quants is a scoring section and you should ideally be aiming for 170/170 and nothing else.4. Practice each type of question and double check the concepts from high school that you never really understood but chose to skip anyway :P5. Be stubborn and don’t proceed until you get it right.Check out the best self study partner for cracking the GRE Quants section. I am pretty sure you will find this useful.GRE verbal in 10 days:GRE is predominantly a vocabulary based section. The quants section of the GRE isn’t very hard to crack and the analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to you GRE score. The verbal section will generally be the make or mar factor in your GRE and will make the difference between you getting into a premier institute or average institute abroad. If you are from an English medium school you would already be strong with your basics which makes it all the more easy for you to prepare yourself. Being thorough with the high frequency words can actually help you a lot. Check out the Barron’s 333.There are very few types of questions in the verbal section like text completion, sentence correction, reading comprehension and critical reasoning. I highly recommend the GRE verbal prep: A definitive guide. It is probably the best study material for a quick preparation. There are loads of practice questions and tests that are available along with videos which will definitely help you remember the words and their in-context meaning. Several shortcuts, tips and mnemonics are also a part of the videos. When you connect things with pictures, you remember them better which is exactly what the videos do. The etymology of the words are also dealt with in detail so that you can understand how a word came into existence and how it has evolved over the years.The MOCK frenzy with an error log:You still have a few days left. You should be taking up as many mock tests as possible. Go CRAZY!Keep solving questions and analyzing them.Keep a check on your progress.Identify the topics which aren’t really comfortable with. They may turn out to be the Achilles Heel on the day of the exam so don’t leave anything to chance.There is no point in solving umpteen number of problems from topics which are your strong suit. Solve more problems related to the topic which you aren’t comfortable withSolve → Analyze → Identify errors → solve more → RepeatOn the day before the exam JUST CHILL. Stop learning and don’t learn anything new since it is more likely that you will get confused because of it. Brush up on the concepts and KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK!A few of the following tips may come in handy:The GRE is a timed test: If we had all the time we need, then every one of us would get the perfect score on the GRE. But the GRE is a timed test, so it is important to not only be accurate but also quick when it comes to answering the questions. So when preparing for the GRE, time yourself. You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 mins both in the Verbal and the Quants section. Attempt a lot of mock tests it will help you a lot.Be aware of the wrong answers:The wrong answers generally tend to fall under certain categories which will help you eliminate the wrong choices when it comes to the GRE verbal reasoning section or reading comprehensions.The choices are most probably wrong if they:Assume too muchAre beyond the scope of the passageAre too extremeAre true but involve outside knowledgeAre too specific/too broadSave the worst for the last:They usually say save the best for the last but it doesn’t hold good when it comes to the competitive exams like GRE. You will end up wasting time if you attempt the unfamiliar questions. If you find a question complex, it is better to leave it for the time being and improve your score by answering the questions related to the easier and familiar questions.Utilize the scratch pad:Take short notes while reading the comprehension passage in the space allotted. Eliminate the unnecessary details and words which are just present to throw you off.The following are a few tips that might come in handy when it comes to the reading comprehension but they might also be applied to any question in the verbal section.DUMB them down:Questions on reading comprehension passages have the most gray area when compared to any other type of question in the GRE.Avoid skimming through the questions without understanding what is specifically being asked. If you find a question or choice confusing rephrase the question in your one words.Be on the look out for concessions:In many cases, the author may have a strong voice towards a certain topic or aspect in the passages. The author might have a strong opinion towards certain aspects in a passage and argue for it throughout the passage but then the author might suddenly stop doing so and make subtle or drastic concessions to the opposing side which will weaken the arguments that were previously made in the reading comprehension passage. Make sure that you aren’t thrown by such concessions.Make use of the context:If the question asked is related to a specific line in the reading comprehension passage, it won’t help if you just go back and read the sentence. The thumb rule is to read at least one sentence before and after the aforementioned line.Zero in on the idea behind the longer passages:Majority of the reading comprehension passages that you will come across while taking the GRE will be short but on the off chance that you encounter one or two longer ones, it is advisable to focus more on the first and last paragraphs of the passage and find the big picture of the passage, since time is of the essence.Find the tone of the passage:The tone of the passage can be found using the choice of words or the turn of phrases used by the author. Even if the tone appears to be neutral, assume that it is complex and look for the tone. You can arrive at the tone by observing the diction or by asking the following questions:Does the author feel positively or negatively about a certain topic?What aspect of the topic does the author criticize?What concerns does the author raise through the passage?Which adverbs and adjectives does the author use to voice his opinion?Last but not the leastWatch your diet: An important factor which most students ignore to their detriment is their health and diet. This is very important both during your preparation and while taking the test. Ensure that you stick to a nutritious diet since you will need a lot of energy during your preparation. It is a good thing to avoid eating outside especially junk food, during your preparatory phase. Also, refrain from drinking, partying and taking recreational drugs a week or two before the Test day.P.S.

However, I started with a good foundation. With my SAT history and intense workload at college, I scored 320+ on my first mock test after I reviewed the vocabulary — in other words, it took me nothing but memorizing a few words to get myself at around 320.People at different levels or from different backgrounds require different strategies and time investment to reach that 320 goal. Regardless, the 20 days I spent got me 15+ points further. I can’t tell you how to reach 320 without knowing much about your background and needs, but I can tell you how to utilize a shorter time period to make some good progress:Focus. The famous 80/20 Rule states that roughly 80% of your outcomes come from 20% of your inputs.[1] This applies to GRE as well. There will be areas on GRE where you can most quickly improve. When the time is limited, you need to focus on those areas to make the most progress. Take a few mock tests and find those spots, and work on them relentlessly.Make mistakes. Don’t worry about them at all. It is a good thing to find yourself making mistakes when you’re practicing than you do on the real test. When you practice, you want to expose all the possible ways you make mistakes, and then find ways to avoid them. The reality is, aside from the vocabulary, GRE hardly covers anything that esoteric. In many cases, it’s the silly mistakes you make that really keeps you from getting your dream score. Learning how to avoid those mistakes can allow you to improve quickly. You just need to identify them first, by making them.Analyze. Don’t just practice questions after questions. Think about them. Find patterns, find how you get them wrong, and find quicker ways to solve these questions. At the end of the day, it’s not the quantity of questions that you practiced on that matters the most, it’s how you treat them. Don’t just focus on getting the questions right, focus on how to get better.Consolidate. After you’ve practiced, made mistakes, and analyzed them, now it’s time to consolidate your takeaways. Make yourself a list of actions you can take during the actual test to help yourself perform better. This could include double checking your zeros, or being more alarmed of particular words, or things you tend to forget or overlook. Take a good look at them before you take the test.Many of my friends have asked me how I got the score I have. Frankly this is it. Now I’m building Gregory to help people do these things automatically. I’d be happy to hear any thoughts/feedback on it.Footnotes[1] What Is The 80/20 Rule And Why It Will Change Your Life","First nothing is impossible for anyone to achieve. 21 days is a very short period of time and I don’t want to discourage you. But I do have some tips for a preparation.Vocabulary Building for Verbal Section - Take two alphabets each day and start memorizing at least 30 words per alphabet. Try grouping the synonyms together and writing down the antonyms. This will help you learning more words easily. Download the Magoosh Vocabulary flash cards app on your phone and start preparing right away.Barron’s 3000 word list is available online. You should read it and try acing as many words as possible.Quantitative - Make a time table with the detailed versions of every section in mathematics. You should take up one topic every day and start practicing different level difficulty questions. Try to remember the tricks, the area formulas, the shortcuts. Make a copy where you could note the tricks and the formulas which you glance every day before starting a new topic. Make ALERT AREAS AS THOSE YOU ARE TAKING MOST OF THE TIME SOLVING.Each day read essays on different GRE topics. Try framing your own essays and also practice the “ISSUE” Topic that comes for writing. It will be a refreshing break from your daily maths practice and will also help you think pragmatically in the direction of the topic.It is important to familiarize yourself with 3 hours while taking the GRE exam. Register for an online test series by Manhattan Prep or Princeton review. You should at least take 6 online tests before appearing for the GRE if your are aiming a score above 320. Look into your problem areas. Manage time and you will be well acquainted with what you will be facing on the real day of the examination. I feel with systematic approach and a lot of practice you can ACE the GRE.","20 Days - it is a really small amount for preparation, but you can manage it.

It should include the “W” questions: Who? What? Where? When? Which? and Why?M - Measurable: A proper schedule should be created and maintained. Establish a concrete number - how many number of words would you like to master? How many weeks would you like to spend for each GRE section? How will I determine if I have accomplished it?A - Achievable: A schedule with defined time and activity is something needed for preparation. Make sure that the words you wanted to master and the time you want to prepare would be achievable. Also, practice as many mock test as possible to avoid cram during exam.R - Realistic: Provide each list of words a realistic time to finish.

But I can speak for GREedge as I was enrolled in one of their programs. The experience was definitely good as I recently took the GRE and scored 323 and 4 in AWA.When you enroll with GREedge, they give you two SFAs (Student Facilitator and Analysts) who work with you throughout the process. They constantly remind you of your goals for the week, things you have pending and other stuff. They give you an idea about what things to read to improve your comprehensive reading skills (which is pivotal in an exam like GRE) with respect to the GRE. In a nutshell, they are really helpful pushing you to be consistent.Their “Learning Tracker” is a good place where various tools are there for your disposal, like the “Ask a doubt” feature or different wordlists or the dictionary app which focuses on GRE words. Everything is neatly organised and the best part is you can work on it from anywhere anytime. They provide you a huge amount of material both in quant and in verbal and it is up to you to use it. Also, they tell you to set a target score in quant and in verbal and they provide you statistical data showing where you stand among the different students who have achieved the target score set by you. So, it gives you a fair idea regarding how much more effort you need to put subject wise and topic wise. Also, they frequently conduct seminars where different people talk about different techniques which can be implemented in different sections of the exam or about their experiences regarding GRE and MS in general. So, that helps too.The most striking feature of GREedge is their “Wordbot” app where they provide you a set of words with pictures describing their meanings. Now, you may not remember the meaning of a certain word, like “appalled” for instance, but you’ll certainly remember the appalled expression of Brad Pitt which is shown in the picture describing the word. My point is you can retain pictures more easily than words. And it helps, at least in my case it did. And not a single word in my GRE was outside the set of words in Wordbot.Overall, it was a rewarding experience for me. And lastly, it is always up to you to take maximum use of the resources of any program. I understand it becomes hard especially if you are working on a job, but it helped me. And, as someone has already said, it ultimately boils down to the amount of effort you make.So, all the best!","I Galvanize is a good option for GRE preparation.

Prepare a timeline.First things first, complete the Magoosh GRE Material videos. Both Verbal and Quants. They will take you quite some time. But they will be more than helpful in jogging old memories and clearing out the rust on those 10th standard mathematics that are already there but have been dormant being unused.Understand more importantly the process they are following to solve. Mathematics will follow straightforward logic, whereas Verbal might seem a little illogical at first, but really it is not. For Verbal it is VERY important to know the EXACT meaning of the words (Where constant practice from Magoosh Flashcards will help you) and also the structure and overall meaning of the sentence provided. Once you start getting the hang of it, you will start to understand the meaning and tone of the sentence, both in Reading Comprehension passages and Text Completions.Next, you MUST complete the ETS Official Guides, all 3 of them. There will be 2 mock tests provided in the book. Make sure you complete them and try to bring a score of +/- 2 from your target score. For example, for me the target score was 330, so I targeted for 328 - 332 in the ETS mocks.Next, the Manhattan 5 lb. book will be immensely helpful. Practice as much as you can each day. Doing BOTH Quants and Verbal. Complete the book by doing each and every problem and going through the answers that you did wrong or had confusion in. Also, make timelines (I did every alternate day) and give the 6 mocks one by one from Manhattan during this period. These mocks are a lot harder than actual GRE, so if you are scoring 318 - 322, expect a high score in GRE.Last but not the least, read, understand and memorize the words from Magoosh Flashcards. They will come extremely handy when you’re doing RC or TC.In the end, believe in yourself. Practice a lot and be confident of your ability. Most importantly, drink a lot of fluids! (Not just before the exam though - your washroom time is counted as the exam time except for breaks)Have a blast with the exam!

Preparation is a key ingredient in order to fulfill your dream of being admitted in USA Colleges/universities.Here is a schedule guide in Mastering Words for you:If I may suggest, identifying the SMART objective of your GRE preparation would be pretty useful. (You can actually create your own timeline for this)S - Specific: Your end-goal should be stated, for example: Be confident when taking the GRE exam because I have prepared very well, studied every topic and even had practice tests to enhance more my skills. It should include the “W” questions: Who? What? Where? When? Which? and Why?M - Measurable: A proper schedule should be created and maintained. Establish a concrete number - how many number of words would you like to master? How many weeks would you like to spend for each GRE section? How will I determine if I have accomplished it?A - Achievable: A schedule with defined time and activity is something needed for preparation. Make sure that the words you wanted to master and the time you want to prepare would be achievable. Also, practice as many mock test as possible to avoid cram during exam.R - Realistic: Provide each list of words a realistic time to finish. Let’s say a list of 10 words can be mastered in 3 days or maybe a week. That includes reviewing it through games/the help of vocab app. I suggest you use Preped Vocab - for free.

This helps you grow your vocabulary really fast. Synonyms and antonyms are quite useful in the actual exam. The quant asked in the exam has really basic concepts. You should learn to read between the lines and try to grasp the generic form of it. Go back to your 10th grade books. They contain quite a lot of useful information. Keep giving mocks on a regular basis to acclimatise yourself to the exam giving environment. 4-5 days before the final exam, give PowerPrep I. This would be quite close to the real GRE. Devise a strategy for the final exam. You should decide when to take a break if need be. On exam day, be prepared with all your documents needed for the exam.

GRE,What are some good novels to read to improve your vocabulary from a GRE point of view?,https://www.quora.com//What-are-some-good-novels-to-read-to-improve-your-vocabulary-from-a-GRE-point-of-view,"Graduate Record Examination (GRE), List Question",5,"I think this question should be interpreted as what are some reading sources to help strengthen vocabulary, while studying for the GRE? Not, should I read literature to help me prepare for the verbal section of the GRE?The answer to the latter is a clear ""no""; you must use GRE prep books to help become adept at answering GRE questions. Of course the first question begs the question. After all, why would you read literature/novels when studying GRE vocabulary? The answer is that many of the words employed in contemporary novels are fair game for the GRE. Notice, I say ""contemporary"" novels. Once you get back to the pre-1900's the words tend to be more obscure. Not all of them, of course. But you don't want to waste you time learning words that aren't going to show up on the test. Now assuming you are reading a novel that uses GRE-level vocabulary Why not just stick to a GRE word list? The answer is twofold. First, learning words as you read presents words in a context (very helpful for the GRE). You should guess the word based on the context, but then always look up the word. This process--encountering word, guessing word, looking word up--provides a robust introduction to the word and makes it more likely that you will remember the word in the long-term, compared to encountering as one of hundreds of words in a vocab list or flashcard deck. The second reason is you will notice words that you've encountered in GRE word lists. Many of these words will only have a tenuous grasp of; seeing the word in a novel not only provides a jolt of recognition, but will allow you to combine your inchoate knowledge of the word with the context to help you arrive at a definition (remember to always look up regardless). Anyhow, sorry for the lengthy preamble :). In answer to your question, I would recommend perusing the Modern Library's list of the top 100 novels of the 20th century. GRE Vocabulary Books: Recommended Fiction and Non-FictionFor the ones that interest you, head over to amazon and use the ""look inside"" feature. Is the story interesting? Are there enough words to keep things challenging but not overburden you? You can cross check words you encounter with words that are part of the Magoosh GRE Vocabulary eBook / flashcards, or words that part of the Magoosh product. Simply enter the vocabulary word and ""magoosh"" into the google searchbox. Magoosh has over a thousand GRE words, so that if most of the words from the novel overlap with the Magoosh words, you know that novel is one rich with vocabulary words. I should also mention that I work for Magoosh! Hopefully, that will provide you will plenty of literature to help those GRE words stick :).","The Wizard of Oz Vocabulary Builder!Here's why:The vocabulary words appear in the context of a continuous story. You'll enjoy what you read and you'll remember what the words mean. (By the way, L. Frank Baum's original story was written for children and is rather tame. This version, written for teenagers and adults, is far more thrilling, scary, and intense.)The definitions are user-friendly. Let's say, for example, that you don't know the meaning of the word ""disdain."" When you look it up in a dictionary, you find that it means ""scorn; contempt."" You don't know what those words mean either, so you look up ""scorn,"" only to learn that it means ""disdain; contempt."" Then you look up ""contempt."" You guessed it: ""disdain; scorn."" The definitions in The Wizard of Oz Vocabulary Builder are very easy to understand; they never use words you don't know.The illustrative sentences are a hoot. Author Phillips searched the globe looking for the world's best illustrative sentences. These sentences not only make the word in question unforgettable, but they entertain you (some of them are laugh-out-loud funny) or inform you (many teach you something interesting or even astonishing about history, politics, literature, science, music, or art!).The Wizard of Oz Vocabulary Builder teaches vocabulary with a three-pronged approach. First, you read the word in context, in the story. Next, you read the word's definition. Finally, you read an unforgettable illustrative sentence. All three steps reinforce each other so that you can't possibly forget the meanings of the words. Source: Internet.Thanks for A2A! All the best! :)","My two cents, purely because I believe it is MOST important to read books. I don't know User-12934483509274756356 or Chris Lele personally, but I'm going to stick my neck out and say that they already have average to good vocabulary skills, and can guess in what context to use a particular word. Let me give you a couple of examples:When I see the word peruse, I may not remember the exact meaning of the word. But I know its something to do with reading books, because I've come across the word somewhere.Words may also appear in forms which aren't commonly used. Ramify is not a common form, but ramifications is a more commonly used word. I may not know the exact meaning, but I have heard the sentence, ""What are the ramifications of your actions?"" or words to that effect. So its something to do with consequences of actions, and hence in a position to guess what the word means. I grant that there are a lot of words which you may not come across any book that you may read. But all that reading gives you a better perspective to make an educated guess at the meaning. Besides, its a lot more fun than going over word lists.That being said, you cannot read passively. You will have to make a list of new words you come across as you read, which will start to get in the way of absorbing what you are reading. You'll have to make a conscientious effort to manage both without letting either goal suffer. Also, you cannot use this method if you're planning to write the GRE in a couple of months. If you've got more than that, and can read a book in 1-2 weeks, then here's a small suggestion list.1. Anything by P.G. Wodehouse, Dickens2. Most books published by the Oxford University Press.3. Reader's Digest Condensed books. 4. Lord of the Rings.In these four points, I've covered a large selection of titles. You can pick up anything which catches your fancy and start off.","Should you read novels to improve your GRE verbal section? Don’t if you plan to give the GRE within the next 2 to 3 months, but if you spend hours every day just staring at a wall then better to read something. However if you plan to sit the GRE exam after at least 6 months then reading novels can be beneficial. I found this article pretty comprehensive and includes a big list of good novels for GRE prep Best Novels to Read for GRE Preparation"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5.

GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"

At most, you will have only 10 study days during that span, and 30 days to forget what you've studied. This is not a promising ratio.Interrogate your schedule. Find time to work a little bit every day. Even twenty minutes with flashcards at breakfast or while waiting for the bus, if done consistently over your 40 day window, will have a much larger effect than cramming over five weekends.As for where to look for guidance, there are lots of things you can do. First, though, you need to take a practice exam. You can download free tests direct from the testmaker's website at http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_g... . Try to take the practice exam in conditions that mirror your test day environment. In other words, make sure you don't have too many distractions around, turn off the cell phone for the duration, don't check Facebook, Twitter, etc. Try to take it at the same time of day as you've scheduled your test, too.Once you've taken the practice exam, you'll have some good data on what topics you tend to do well on and which ones you tend to struggle with. Using the PowerPrep software's review function, work each question until you understand precisely why the right answer is the right answer and the wrong answers are wrong. To do well on any standardized test, you have to get in the head of the testmaker. You need to understand what they consider ""in bounds"" and what they consider ""irrelevant"". There is no ""best"" answer to any question, no matter what your teachers (or even ETS) may have told you. If there are five answer choices given for a question, then four of them are categorically wrong--not kind of right, not sort of right, not almost right. Only one answer can be credited, and you have to understand what the testmaker's standards are for that.If you can't figure out how to do a question, do a Google search for the first few words as a phrase. (Put quotes around it.) Usually you'll be able to find a web forum somewhere where someone else has asked about that same question. Read the explanations. When people explain their method, try to figure out what things they saw in the question that clued them in that that was the method to use. Every standardized test gives you signs that, if you can learn to read them, will make formerly opaque questions seem easy. Or, to put it another way, you have to learn the testmakers' writing style, their tics and habits that give away what they want you to do.Try to find someone in your area who's also studying. There might be a study group at a college near you, or at a local library. Even if none of you are experts at the test overall, you'll each have some strength. And by explaining concepts and questions to other people, you cement your own understanding better. Teaching is often the best way to truly learn a subject.If you have money to spend, look for a private tutor in your area with experience and references. Craigslist can be a good resource for this, though make sure you talk to former students before plunking down any cash. Consider also taking a crash course from one of the big names in test preparation like Kaplan and the Princeton Review. Both have online-only study-at-your-own-pace offerings that are good value for the money and good alternatives for people who, like you, have a limited time frame for study.Barring that, go to your local bookstore's test preparation section and buy a prep book from a reputable company. Avoid books put out by people or companies who have no particular experience with test prep in general, even if they are well known for expertise in other academic fields. This is because even though the concepts on standardized tests are ones you're expected to have learned elsewhere in life, the very fact that these tests are standardized--that is, they follow the same patterns year in and out--means that people who don't consider the test as a test will be disadvantaged when the final score is calculated. Again, Kaplan and the Princeton Review are the go-to names for this.","Apart from usual Barron's and Kalpan, I believe Vocabsmith is the finest tool in the market. I had subscribed to thefull word list package, which has 3700+ GRE words. There are also High Frequency (1000 words) and Ultra High Frequency (400 words)packages available. VocabSmith gives you meanings, usages and pronunciations for every word. The crux of learning new words lies in repetitions. VocabSmith repeates every word in a definite frequency that’s tuned to my learning; I could mark every word if I was confident, or otherwise. Further, the  words that I found difficult were given greater attention. VocabSmit has analytics to maintain a good log of my progress. Best part was,this tool was on my mobile and I could use it on the go! In the canteen, in the classroom, in the hostel on the sofa, while waiting at the restaurant etc., I could use it anywhere. I used VocabSmith for 2 months regulary for -45 – 60 minutes everyday, for 2 months. My vocabulary for GRE improved drastically during this period.

GRE,How to crack gre with a score of 310+ in 10 days?,https://www.quora.com//How-to-crack-gre-with-a-score-of-310+-in-10-days,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Study Strategies, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Studying, Exams and Tests",17,"Writing this after 3 months since getting back my official scores. I figured that this might help other aspirants who might be having a time-crunch. Should have written this earlier but procrastinated :)First of all, allow me to give a brief overview of the turn of events that compelled me to take GRE in the first place.I work in at an IT MNC. Like many IT professionals in India, I had become disenchanted with my job after 2 years. Though I didn't particularly dislike it, the sheer redundancy forced me to look for other options.Like many of my peers, I took a crack at various MBA exams in India but my results were not up to the mark. At this point of time, seeing many of my friends take up higher studies in USA, I decided to write GRE. The thought of being left behind by my friends coupled with the lure of big bucks to be earned in US was difficult to ignore.Hence I booked my slot on 31st January. I took the earliest date available (10th February) so that I could apply for the fall program of some universities. Needless to say, I was on a really tight schedule. Time-management became crucial and I had to devise an effective plan that would make registering for GRE worth the investment (the benchmark for me was a 320+ score).Below is the section-wise breakdown of how I approached the 3 sections of GRE :Quantitative Reasoning - This is the section which can drastically boost your score. Assuming that you are reasonably familiar with the basic concepts of maths, a 160+ score can be easily achieved in this section. Having already prepared for those wretched MBA exams, I was pretty sure that I could achieve a 165+ score in this section. Word of advice to all aspirants - get your basics right, practice as much questions as you can and look out for trap questions.Verbal Reasoning - This section is quite tricky as you can’t really guess what will be thrown at you. Also, the humongous amount of GRE words can demoralize even the ardent vocab lovers. The trick for the vocab part is to learn the words in such a way that they are imprinted in your mind. For this I installed Memrise app on my phone. This is a really handy app and with its interactive mode of learning and regular reviews, I was able to learn some of the frequently asked words in GRE pretty easily. I briefly revised Norman Lewis's legendary Word power made Easy (a must read) book, which I had during my second year (this was 5 years ago) in college and to my astonishment, I could recall most of the words, such is the beautiful way in which this book is crafted. For RC’s and sentence completion I referred Manhattan material which I think is more than adequate. I had targeted a 155+ score in this section. Word of advice to all aspirants - don’t just mug up the words, that won’t help much. Try to figure out the root of the word, its popular usage or create an image of a tricky word in your mind. This way the probability of the retention of the meaning will drastically increase. Also, while doing RC’s read the whole text very carefully, don’t skim through any portion of it.AWA - Increasing your AWA score within a short time frame is difficult. I would advice all the aspirants to look at the responses given by various test takers and how they were evaluated/scored by the GRE essay readers. This would give you an idea about how to frame your response and the strategy that is to be employed while writing them.Besides this, take as much Practice tests as you can. ETS has 2 sample tests which are very good. Manhattan and Kaplan also provide free tests once you sign up on their website. Within the time-frame of 10 days, plan to take at least 5–6 Practice tests. After taking each test analyze your performance and see where you had made mistakes. These tests and their analysis are the most crucial part of your preparation, so spend more time on this.I hope this answer might help you out :)Suggestion are always welcome. Do let me know your questions/thoughts in the comments.","I just took the GRE last week after approximately 1 week of preparation and I scored a total of 328 with 165 in Math/Quantitative Reasoning and 163 in Verbal Reasoning.Note that universities look at the percentiles rather than the absolute scores. My scores put me at 90th percentile in Math/Quantitative Reasoning and 92nd percentile in Verbal Reasoning even though I had a higher score in the prior section.http://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre...I suppose I would be the most qualified to answer this question by taking my 7-day preparation experience, as compared to theoretical predictions from people who have not actually done it and are not basing their advice on any real 10-day preparation experience.In terms of strategy, it is much easier to get a higher absolute score in Quantitative Reasoning. (Thus the lower percentiles for a higher score in comparison to Verbal Reasoning.)Aim to score 165 for Quantitative Reasoning, which is easily possible with a few hours of preparation (I am assuming that you are smart enough and did well enough in Math previously to get into an undergraduate course). Having a 165 there gives you leeway to score just 145 for Verbal Reasoning to achieve a total score of 310.Preparation Breakdown:Day 1: spent 5 hours reading about GRE format, reading about the sources of preparation materials and their relative usefulness and effectiveness.Day 2: spent 7 hours looking for preparation materials and spent 3 hours on vocabulary flashcards.Day 3: spent 12 hours coding an addon for the flashcard application to give me more data about types of words I needed to pay more attention to.Day 4: had to do something else, spent 0 hours on GREDay 5: spent 3 hours on the official guide for Math, spent 2 hours on vocabulary flashcardsDay 6: spent 3 hours on vocabulary flashcardsDay 7: spent 3 hours on vocabulary flashcards, 2 hours on a sample testDay 8: spent 2 hours on flashcards, 2 hours on the official essay samples, 2 hours watching a newly released show, 4 hours on a test skipping all breaks,  1.5 hours analyzing my mistakesMost importantly: have at least 4.5 hours of sleep on the night before the GRE. I made the decision to get sufficient sleep instead of doing a 3rd test.Prior Ability and What I Had To Do:Scored A1 for O Level Math in middle school. GRE math essentially uses O Level Math fundamentals but is 10x more tricky and 4x more complicated. Even though it has been years since my O Levels, whatever I remembered was good enough, so I only skimmed through the basics in 10 minutes and didn't focus on them. I mainly focused on learning the tricky traps and making sure I didn't fall for the tricks and traps in the questions.Scored A1 for O Level English and A for A Level General Paper. For GRE Analytical Writing, I mainly looked at the structure of the essays, to identify how the essay structure answered the corresponding question, particularly for the Argument Task since it was very different from regular essays.Majority of vocabulary used in GRE Verbal Reasoning Text Completion Questions and Sentence Equivalence Questions is obscure as fudge. When I started, I did not know most of the vocabulary used in them, so I had to use flashcards to learn a few hundred words within the week. I spent the most time on this.GRE Verbal Reasoning Reading Comprehension Passages requires either prior understanding of English or probably months of preparation to bolster your ability to understand English. Did not prepare for this. Probably not possible to prepare this within 1 week.Traps to Avoid Since You're Very Very Tight on Time:Most of the free tests online are lousy and irrelevant to the actual GRE. Since you are very limited on time, and each test takes about 3 hours, it is a huge waste of time to do most of them. I looked at a couple and immediately felt they were weird. After having taken the real GRE, I would say those weird ones would have been a complete waste of time had I spent time on them.Your time would be better spent on flashcards and improving the speed that you can correctly do the existing RELEVANT questions.Focus your efforts on the 2 official GRE tests given to you. Focus on perfecting one while saving the other for an accurate assessment on the last day.","Since this question ask about complete preparation plan, my answer can be a bit longer..I will try to keep it concise as well as precise!Let us divide the preparation according to three sections and try to cover all of them in 3-4 months -Quantitative - If you are good with the basic concepts of mathematics, this section can  help you boost up your score with at least 5-8 marks easily. But let us assume you still have to improve you concepts. I would suggest, refer to quantitative aptitude by R.S. Agarwal. Read and understand first two pages of every chapter which contains theory part and short tricks. After getting a grasp over concepts practice questions from Kaplan's quantitative material. Do at least a chapter everyday. If you are not able to score well in quantitative section, then refer to my answer Aman Sharma's answer to How can I improve GRE quant score 143 to 160? That can help.AWA - This section requires a lot of reading and writing practice. Start reading articles from websites, newspaper and try to write a paragraph about what you have read and what did you understand. If you don't have time to proceed this way, then there is a short cut to get at least 3.5 in AWA (which I did). Find answers for issues and arguments topics on google and categorize the endless pool into different sections like education, technology, science, politics, government, society, culture, religion etc. Once you have categorized them read 4-5 answers for every section and try to remember examples that you have read. They will surely fit in any question that might appear in your GRE. But do practice writing once or twice in a week because you should be in a habit of bringing out the best in 30 minutes!Verbal - As it appears to most of us, the most tough section in GRE. But you can get a decent score if preparation is well planned. Have a mind set that you have to learn at least 1000-1500 words before you appear for GRE. You don't have to learn them all at once, but around 30 words everyday. Now let us start with book Barrens 333. Learn all 333 words perfectly. Once you are done with learning these words start practicing for questions. You have to attempt 20 questions of each type i.e. Sentence  Equivalence, Text Completion and Reading Comprehension everyday. Refer to Princeton 1014 for SE and TC & Manhattan 5lb for RC. If you complete these books go for Kaplan. Level of Kaplan is slightly more than what actually comes in GRE. Along with these questions keep learning new words and revising old ones. Remember learning new is not that important as remembering old ones. Also do not learn random words, search online for 1000 high frequency words and learn them first.So if we have to conclude with what we have to cover everyday, we can say that, an article/issue/argument answer, 30 words, 1 chapter of quantitative and 60 questions for Verbal.I hope this helps! Do post in comments if you have any question.","A2A A great thought, some of the aspirants have scored even 330+ with just a week to prepare. But you need a strong determination, being comfortable with both English and Math and must be able to squeeze out the most number of hours from the 10 days. A very good way is to score a perfect 170 in Math, and score 140 in verbal. Ah this seems quite plausible but scoring 170 is not everyone's cup of tea even how good they are in math. The key to score 170 in math is getting your basics correct, practicing hard and the last- not falling for trap answers. So given that the 170+140 option is almost ruled out(its very good if you are able to achieve this combination), you can try with the 165+145 option. Scoring 165 in math is reasonably easy(not as difficult as 170), but  the problem comes in scoring 145 in verbal, and this is due to the time constraint. So lets see how to score 145 in verbal. Each verbal section contains close to 1o RC questions, 5 sentence equivalence, 5 text completion. There you see RC questions are the low hanging fruit(its not that easy, I had just compared it to the other sections keeping in mind the time constraints you have). So a 15mark in verbal(145) can be scored by 8+7 breakup in the two sections. If you just brush up the basics of text completion and sentence equivalence, you can crack the easy questions. So the 8+7 need not be essentially from the RC's but its a mix of RC's+ SEq+ TCo.  For text completion's and sentence equivalence, you need a good vocabulary, but not for all the questions, you can surely aim for the easy questions by just reading the words from this list- GRE 400 Vocab Words and Top 101 High Frequency GRE Words - CrunchPrep GRE. By the way 80% of the words come from this list(they came in my exam). Practice TestsYou can find the best list of practice tests here- 33 Free GRE Practice Tests That You Should Definitely Take! - CrunchPrep GRE.

I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It's ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!You could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your termsKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms","It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.You’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements.

A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:The work that client is offering you is his/her dream.Your client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.Be reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.The client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.Don’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.The only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.9. Be ProfessionalWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-Starting date of projectThe project’s deadlineMilestonesFunctionalitiesSchedule meeting in priorMake the clear timeline of deliverables.Professionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–Keep Your Personal Life limited to yourselfYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself.

GRE,How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-start-freelancing-Should-I-just-take-jobs-and-see-what-happens-or-take-some-kind-of-course-and-then-proceed,"Freelancers, Freelance Tips and Hacks, Freelancing",100+,"A freelancer's guide to taking over the world!Establish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.Educate yourself:It's a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.Get organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn't have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.Another thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.Know your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.Manage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.My suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.The golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - ExpenditureGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.Market your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients.

If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.Always give very clear and genuine project timeline.Understand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.Note down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.Never steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.All the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own servicesOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.There are three different strategies that can be opted for are-Cost-plus pricingYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.Market Rate pricingBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.Value driven pricingIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.6. Timely Communication with ClientsCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadlineBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.Since you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.8. Always deliver more than ExpectedLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”Keeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.The only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.9. Be ProfessionalWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-Starting date of projectThe project’s deadlineMilestonesFunctionalitiesSchedule meeting in priorMake the clear timeline of deliverables.Professionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–Keep Your Personal Life limited to yourselfYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.  It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.Charge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.Schedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.If some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.Build the right association.It is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.Follow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.Don’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.Be positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.10. Networking and Relationship with ClientsBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..Some useful techniques to grow your network.1. Increase your Social Media Network  Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.  2. Attend events You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.3. Speak at events Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event. 4. Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at. 5. Connect at co-working space You can share your desk with other freelancers from another field; this is the best way to enrich knowledge and network.  All points listed above reinforces you to become a freelancer, your perfect profile generation for freelance success and helps you in becoming your own boss with a promising career ahead."
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How do I prepare for the GRE in 2 months? Can anyone suggest books?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-prepare-for-the-GRE-in-2-months-Can-anyone-suggest-books,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), How-to Question",27,"Yes absolutely. I scored a 334 with 2 months of prep. Link to books and free resources below.Create a plan that works for you based on your schedule, however here are some crucial elements of your Prep that you must follow:1. Practice TestsUse the paid Manhattan Prep test series for your mock test practice. There are 6 tests available here. Along with this, you'll find 1 free Kaplan test, 2 tests in the ETS Official guide, and 2 free Powerprep II Tests that you can download from the ETS website. Don't do more than 1 mock a week. And save the Powerpreps for the end.The GRE is a long long exam, and even after doing many mocks, the final test day can be pretty draining. That is why not taking any shortcuts on the mocks, is extremely important. It is also important to ensure that you do the tests around the time that you will be giving the GRE, so that your mind and body are ready to be alert - 8am, 10am, or whatever slot you will be booking.Begin your preparation with Manhattan's first mock to know where you stand and what you need to work on - weaknesses. That's free.After that - using the same email id with which you make your Manhattan a/c, go on Amazon and buy the Manhattan Sentence Equivalence book - Kindle version. Then email your amazon receipt to Manhattan from that same email id. They will activate your mock tests - 6, valid for 6 months. (Google this process once to make sure its still valid, shouldn't have changed since I just did it 1.5 months back). This way you can get the tests for less than 500 rupees.2. VocabularyVocabulary needs practice from the start, everyday. For that the Magoosh app is good, but a better way to do it is - download the 'Quizlet' app on your phone and search for Rajeshwar1247 or ""Magoosh GRE Flashcards"". This kind individual has uploaded everything from the Magoosh Vocab book onto this app. You can learn and quiz yourself through this, so its a much faster method. Start doing this asap.Don’t bother learning too many words, these 1000 words should be enough. The difficulty on the actual test is not that words are unfamiliar, but that the sentences are complex.So instead of buying more vocabulary books and wasting money, practice all the Sentence Equivalence and Text Completion questions in the Manhattan 5lb book, note down each word you do not know, and make a separate list of those. Also go through the answers to catch your mistakes.3. Analytical WritingAll the issue/argument topics are up on the ETS website, but going through them all does not help. First, Any guide (Official ETS Verbal guide, Manhattan RC guide) will provide you with an explanation of the general patterns of each type of essay. It is important to understand this and then read a few sample essays that score high (again found in guides).The writing sections are not testing knowledge but instead structure and critical thinking ability. If you have a flair for writing, this should not be too challenging. However, if not, then take up a few topics and write your own essays, and then compare them with sample essays provided in the verbal or Manhattan guide. You will notice that you have missed out on a few arguments, and that will slowly help you think more critically, and write better essays.4. Verbal and Quant PracticeStep 1 is to do the ETS General Test guide cover to cover, to understand the test and the Verbal and Quant sections. Do all the questions in the book and ensure you are clear about every concept in Quant.Then you begin practice. Here the Manhattan 5lb. book is the best resource, with over 2000 questions. Solve questions in small sets of 20–25 and then go through the answers, understand your mistakes and note your weak areas. Use the insights from this practice and your mock tests to understand topics that you need to be more thorough in.Then pick up the Manhattan book that is specific to your area of weakness and go deeper into that particular topic to completely clarify the concept for yourself. I did this with inequalities, but did not need to for most other topics. Don’t do this unless you feel it is required.For VERBAL in particular, please also do the Official ETS Verbal Guide a few days before your actual GRE exam, since it is important to get accustomed to ETS’ way of testing.If you create a plan covering 25–40 Vocabulary words a day, 40 practice questions and 2 essays and 1 mock practice test a week, you will be more than prepared for a 330+As a bonus, I did all this without spending a penny (except on the manhattan tests). This drive link has all of the resources I have mentioned abovehttps://drive.google.com/drive/f...You will find them easily with some searching.All the best for your test and hope this is useful!","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice tests from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). After this you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams (about 4 hrs.). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e. Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or, you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes. But do use the three aforementioned tests! All you have to do is create a user ID at each of the websites (Kaplan, Manhattan and Princeton). If you buy the Official ETS GRE guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also to analyze the stats for their future test papers. We will not know which section is the experimental one so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section. What we do know is that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is imperative that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Let’s tackle the Verbal section first. (As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes, there are numerous word lists available, but do not start with them first! The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the decks. Do it every day or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But, this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy (WPME)' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible. Chris's approach is brilliant and his enthusiasm is infectious). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands!Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But it’s of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read through the question/passage and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension section, you might come across huge comprehensions with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how they have approached the question. This is vital step for improving your attempts at RCs. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend buying the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section thoroughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests (paper-based) apart from the Powerprep software, which are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these questions will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). Sometimes, you tend to rush into solving the question without looking at the question completely. You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. In the later stages of practicing, start solving with a time limit for each question.  You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions.  For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is explained in the ETS Official GRE material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but, you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully observe what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too! (If you are an Asian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you’ll face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty badly here. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But, I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents. I do know that reading through numerous essays (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section' online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have at least 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day. So I’d recommend giving one of the paper-based tests from the Official ETS GRE material a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time, so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations for the correct answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test. Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now it’s your time to perform. Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel aren’t doing well, but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve a well-rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well. You have the other sections to make up for it. If you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position! Also please don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you’re concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or at least what you aimed for, remember GRE is not the end! I could not get the score I aimed for and initially I was disappointed. Soon I realized that it’s really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed, you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I scored 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know!) and breezed through them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you! Best of luck in cracking the GRE! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Also, I'd really like to know how your exam went, the difficulties/challenges you faced and how you overcame them. Everyone has a different perspective. I have merely written my approach above and I'd love to know your approach. Mentioning score isn't mandatory. You can simply comment on the post or send me a message about your experience with the GRE. Cheers!Sorry for the long post !

So, using it will not be effective preparation with two months to go. Don't waste your time on this.MagooshThere is pretty much no downside to getting the Magoosh Flashcards app since it is free and mostly has words that have a high likelihood of turning up on the test. I started drilling with this app a month before my GRE. Several times, the GRE uses secondary meanings of words and the app does a good job of illustrating these meanings with nice examples. For a free resource, Magoosh is incredibly good and I would recommend reading their GRE blog once in a while.A couple of days before the test, reset your Magoosh word app and just go through all the words again to ensure you know most. If you forget a few advanced ones, don't panic. The probability of them showing up on the test is probably low.General Vocab advice:Write down words that you find difficult. Maybe even make flashcards of your own. Attribute difficult words to settings you are familiar with - traits of your friends, characters from books and TV shows, etc. Use them in conversation (the jokes your friends make about your attempt at grandiloquence may actually help you remember a word's meaning better than any app), throw them into your writing and make mnemonics. Basically, whatever works to make them stick!Like the New Yorker on facebook and read articles about topics that interest you. Each time you see an unfamiliar word, try guessing its meaning based on context and then cross-check using ""define <word>"" on google.Manhattan books and Barron's 800:I personally used neither but Barron's 800 might be a good tool for building vocabulary. The general opinion amongst people about Manhattan prep seems to be positive. So, I guess you can use it for practice.Now, here is what's important. Just learning the words with apps and books will not be enough. You will need to know how they work in context, and for this, you will need to practice actual test-type questions.Get the ETS Official Guide and make sure you do every single question in the book. Also take the practice tests seriously, analyze your weaknesses and work on them systematically.Hope this helps.

GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How do I score 320 in GRE in 20 days?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-score-320-in-GRE-in-20-days,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",17,"Making time would be your biggest concern so you will have to make time everyday or squeeze it into your busy schedule. You need to know the following about the GRE exam before you start your preparation.The GRE exam has 3 sections the analytical writing section, the verbal section and the quants section.The analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to your GRE score so you needn’t break your head about it.The Quants and verbal section are for 170 marks each. The quants is the scoring section and you should ideally be looking to get 170/170 in this section. Anything more than 160 is a great score when it comes to verbal.You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 minutes in each of these sections.Something that most of the people don’t know is that the GRE is actually only for 80 marks but the marks are awarded out of 320 so that we don’t assume that a person who scores a 40 is only half as good as a person who scores 80 so the scores are given on a scale of 260–340.You needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.Getting to the hardest part of it all PREPARATION:You needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.Most people find the Quants section easy so you should just be trying to brush up on your basic concepts. I would suggest you make your concepts concrete and don’t get carried away in cramming as many formulas as possible. Once you’re confident enough try taking up a mock test and see where you stand, analyze your mistakes and then go back to those topics and make sure that there isn’t an Achilles heel. Spend as little time as possible preparing for Quants and I don’t think it will take up a lot of time. 1 hour a day for a month and you should be good to go.The dicey section is the verbal section and it will definitely be the make or mar factor in your GRE since you may not be accustomed to the language used. The best way to prepare for the verbal section is to READ. The verbal section is predominantly vocabulary based and being thorough with vocabulary might just make the difference between you getting into an average institute or premier institute abroad.Please try to stick to the following schedule:Spend two hours each day for the verbal section of GRE and one hour for the Quants section.Make sure that your preparation doesn't take a back seat during the weekends or due to some occasion like a friend's birthday.GRE Quants in a week:People are usually comfortable with the Quants section. If you are from an engineering or science background, you are already leaps and bounds ahead of your peers.1.Brush up your concepts and make sure you don’t get carried away and cram as many formulas as you can.2. Make sure that you approach each problem logically .3. Cover all the bases and make sure to go through each topic since Quants is a scoring section and you should ideally be aiming for 170/170 and nothing else.4. Practice each type of question and double check the concepts from high school that you never really understood but chose to skip anyway :P5. Be stubborn and don’t proceed until you get it right.Check out the best self study partner for cracking the GRE Quants section. I am pretty sure you will find this useful.GRE verbal in 10 days:GRE is predominantly a vocabulary based section. The quants section of the GRE isn’t very hard to crack and the analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to you GRE score. The verbal section will generally be the make or mar factor in your GRE and will make the difference between you getting into a premier institute or average institute abroad. If you are from an English medium school you would already be strong with your basics which makes it all the more easy for you to prepare yourself. Being thorough with the high frequency words can actually help you a lot. Check out the Barron’s 333.There are very few types of questions in the verbal section like text completion, sentence correction, reading comprehension and critical reasoning. I highly recommend the GRE verbal prep: A definitive guide. It is probably the best study material for a quick preparation. There are loads of practice questions and tests that are available along with videos which will definitely help you remember the words and their in-context meaning. Several shortcuts, tips and mnemonics are also a part of the videos. When you connect things with pictures, you remember them better which is exactly what the videos do. The etymology of the words are also dealt with in detail so that you can understand how a word came into existence and how it has evolved over the years.The MOCK frenzy with an error log:You still have a few days left. You should be taking up as many mock tests as possible. Go CRAZY!Keep solving questions and analyzing them.Keep a check on your progress.Identify the topics which aren’t really comfortable with. They may turn out to be the Achilles Heel on the day of the exam so don’t leave anything to chance.There is no point in solving umpteen number of problems from topics which are your strong suit. Solve more problems related to the topic which you aren’t comfortable withSolve → Analyze → Identify errors → solve more → RepeatOn the day before the exam JUST CHILL. Stop learning and don’t learn anything new since it is more likely that you will get confused because of it. Brush up on the concepts and KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK!A few of the following tips may come in handy:The GRE is a timed test: If we had all the time we need, then every one of us would get the perfect score on the GRE. But the GRE is a timed test, so it is important to not only be accurate but also quick when it comes to answering the questions. So when preparing for the GRE, time yourself. You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 mins both in the Verbal and the Quants section. Attempt a lot of mock tests it will help you a lot.Be aware of the wrong answers:The wrong answers generally tend to fall under certain categories which will help you eliminate the wrong choices when it comes to the GRE verbal reasoning section or reading comprehensions.The choices are most probably wrong if they:Assume too muchAre beyond the scope of the passageAre too extremeAre true but involve outside knowledgeAre too specific/too broadSave the worst for the last:They usually say save the best for the last but it doesn’t hold good when it comes to the competitive exams like GRE. You will end up wasting time if you attempt the unfamiliar questions. If you find a question complex, it is better to leave it for the time being and improve your score by answering the questions related to the easier and familiar questions.Utilize the scratch pad:Take short notes while reading the comprehension passage in the space allotted. Eliminate the unnecessary details and words which are just present to throw you off.The following are a few tips that might come in handy when it comes to the reading comprehension but they might also be applied to any question in the verbal section.DUMB them down:Questions on reading comprehension passages have the most gray area when compared to any other type of question in the GRE.Avoid skimming through the questions without understanding what is specifically being asked. If you find a question or choice confusing rephrase the question in your one words.Be on the look out for concessions:In many cases, the author may have a strong voice towards a certain topic or aspect in the passages. The author might have a strong opinion towards certain aspects in a passage and argue for it throughout the passage but then the author might suddenly stop doing so and make subtle or drastic concessions to the opposing side which will weaken the arguments that were previously made in the reading comprehension passage. Make sure that you aren’t thrown by such concessions.Make use of the context:If the question asked is related to a specific line in the reading comprehension passage, it won’t help if you just go back and read the sentence. The thumb rule is to read at least one sentence before and after the aforementioned line.Zero in on the idea behind the longer passages:Majority of the reading comprehension passages that you will come across while taking the GRE will be short but on the off chance that you encounter one or two longer ones, it is advisable to focus more on the first and last paragraphs of the passage and find the big picture of the passage, since time is of the essence.Find the tone of the passage:The tone of the passage can be found using the choice of words or the turn of phrases used by the author. Even if the tone appears to be neutral, assume that it is complex and look for the tone. You can arrive at the tone by observing the diction or by asking the following questions:Does the author feel positively or negatively about a certain topic?What aspect of the topic does the author criticize?What concerns does the author raise through the passage?Which adverbs and adjectives does the author use to voice his opinion?Last but not the leastWatch your diet: An important factor which most students ignore to their detriment is their health and diet. This is very important both during your preparation and while taking the test. Ensure that you stick to a nutritious diet since you will need a lot of energy during your preparation. It is a good thing to avoid eating outside especially junk food, during your preparatory phase. Also, refrain from drinking, partying and taking recreational drugs a week or two before the Test day.P.S. If you are looking for study material I would recommend the following:GRE verbal prep - A definitive guideGRE Prep: Crack the Quantitative Reasoning SectionGre Prep: Crack the Analytical Writing Assessment Section EffortlesslyGood Luck!","I scored 336 on my first shot (V166 V170,) and 20 is about the number of days I actually spent on studying for it. However, I started with a good foundation. With my SAT history and intense workload at college, I scored 320+ on my first mock test after I reviewed the vocabulary — in other words, it took me nothing but memorizing a few words to get myself at around 320.People at different levels or from different backgrounds require different strategies and time investment to reach that 320 goal. Regardless, the 20 days I spent got me 15+ points further. I can’t tell you how to reach 320 without knowing much about your background and needs, but I can tell you how to utilize a shorter time period to make some good progress:Focus. The famous 80/20 Rule states that roughly 80% of your outcomes come from 20% of your inputs.[1] This applies to GRE as well. There will be areas on GRE where you can most quickly improve. When the time is limited, you need to focus on those areas to make the most progress. Take a few mock tests and find those spots, and work on them relentlessly.Make mistakes. Don’t worry about them at all. It is a good thing to find yourself making mistakes when you’re practicing than you do on the real test. When you practice, you want to expose all the possible ways you make mistakes, and then find ways to avoid them. The reality is, aside from the vocabulary, GRE hardly covers anything that esoteric. In many cases, it’s the silly mistakes you make that really keeps you from getting your dream score. Learning how to avoid those mistakes can allow you to improve quickly. You just need to identify them first, by making them.Analyze. Don’t just practice questions after questions. Think about them. Find patterns, find how you get them wrong, and find quicker ways to solve these questions. At the end of the day, it’s not the quantity of questions that you practiced on that matters the most, it’s how you treat them. Don’t just focus on getting the questions right, focus on how to get better.Consolidate. After you’ve practiced, made mistakes, and analyzed them, now it’s time to consolidate your takeaways.

GRE,How do I score 320 in GRE in 20 days?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-score-320-in-GRE-in-20-days,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",17,"Making time would be your biggest concern so you will have to make time everyday or squeeze it into your busy schedule. You need to know the following about the GRE exam before you start your preparation.The GRE exam has 3 sections the analytical writing section, the verbal section and the quants section.The analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to your GRE score so you needn’t break your head about it.The Quants and verbal section are for 170 marks each. The quants is the scoring section and you should ideally be looking to get 170/170 in this section. Anything more than 160 is a great score when it comes to verbal.You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 minutes in each of these sections.Something that most of the people don’t know is that the GRE is actually only for 80 marks but the marks are awarded out of 320 so that we don’t assume that a person who scores a 40 is only half as good as a person who scores 80 so the scores are given on a scale of 260–340.You needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.Getting to the hardest part of it all PREPARATION:You needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.Most people find the Quants section easy so you should just be trying to brush up on your basic concepts. I would suggest you make your concepts concrete and don’t get carried away in cramming as many formulas as possible. Once you’re confident enough try taking up a mock test and see where you stand, analyze your mistakes and then go back to those topics and make sure that there isn’t an Achilles heel. Spend as little time as possible preparing for Quants and I don’t think it will take up a lot of time. 1 hour a day for a month and you should be good to go.The dicey section is the verbal section and it will definitely be the make or mar factor in your GRE since you may not be accustomed to the language used. The best way to prepare for the verbal section is to READ. The verbal section is predominantly vocabulary based and being thorough with vocabulary might just make the difference between you getting into an average institute or premier institute abroad.Please try to stick to the following schedule:Spend two hours each day for the verbal section of GRE and one hour for the Quants section.Make sure that your preparation doesn't take a back seat during the weekends or due to some occasion like a friend's birthday.GRE Quants in a week:People are usually comfortable with the Quants section. If you are from an engineering or science background, you are already leaps and bounds ahead of your peers.1.Brush up your concepts and make sure you don’t get carried away and cram as many formulas as you can.2. Make sure that you approach each problem logically .3. Cover all the bases and make sure to go through each topic since Quants is a scoring section and you should ideally be aiming for 170/170 and nothing else.4. Practice each type of question and double check the concepts from high school that you never really understood but chose to skip anyway :P5. Be stubborn and don’t proceed until you get it right.Check out the best self study partner for cracking the GRE Quants section. I am pretty sure you will find this useful.GRE verbal in 10 days:GRE is predominantly a vocabulary based section. The quants section of the GRE isn’t very hard to crack and the analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to you GRE score. The verbal section will generally be the make or mar factor in your GRE and will make the difference between you getting into a premier institute or average institute abroad. If you are from an English medium school you would already be strong with your basics which makes it all the more easy for you to prepare yourself. Being thorough with the high frequency words can actually help you a lot. Check out the Barron’s 333.There are very few types of questions in the verbal section like text completion, sentence correction, reading comprehension and critical reasoning. I highly recommend the GRE verbal prep: A definitive guide. It is probably the best study material for a quick preparation. There are loads of practice questions and tests that are available along with videos which will definitely help you remember the words and their in-context meaning. Several shortcuts, tips and mnemonics are also a part of the videos. When you connect things with pictures, you remember them better which is exactly what the videos do. The etymology of the words are also dealt with in detail so that you can understand how a word came into existence and how it has evolved over the years.The MOCK frenzy with an error log:You still have a few days left. You should be taking up as many mock tests as possible. Go CRAZY!Keep solving questions and analyzing them.Keep a check on your progress.Identify the topics which aren’t really comfortable with. They may turn out to be the Achilles Heel on the day of the exam so don’t leave anything to chance.There is no point in solving umpteen number of problems from topics which are your strong suit. Solve more problems related to the topic which you aren’t comfortable withSolve → Analyze → Identify errors → solve more → RepeatOn the day before the exam JUST CHILL. Stop learning and don’t learn anything new since it is more likely that you will get confused because of it. Brush up on the concepts and KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK!A few of the following tips may come in handy:The GRE is a timed test: If we had all the time we need, then every one of us would get the perfect score on the GRE. But the GRE is a timed test, so it is important to not only be accurate but also quick when it comes to answering the questions. So when preparing for the GRE, time yourself. You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 mins both in the Verbal and the Quants section. Attempt a lot of mock tests it will help you a lot.Be aware of the wrong answers:The wrong answers generally tend to fall under certain categories which will help you eliminate the wrong choices when it comes to the GRE verbal reasoning section or reading comprehensions.The choices are most probably wrong if they:Assume too muchAre beyond the scope of the passageAre too extremeAre true but involve outside knowledgeAre too specific/too broadSave the worst for the last:They usually say save the best for the last but it doesn’t hold good when it comes to the competitive exams like GRE. You will end up wasting time if you attempt the unfamiliar questions. If you find a question complex, it is better to leave it for the time being and improve your score by answering the questions related to the easier and familiar questions.Utilize the scratch pad:Take short notes while reading the comprehension passage in the space allotted. Eliminate the unnecessary details and words which are just present to throw you off.The following are a few tips that might come in handy when it comes to the reading comprehension but they might also be applied to any question in the verbal section.DUMB them down:Questions on reading comprehension passages have the most gray area when compared to any other type of question in the GRE.Avoid skimming through the questions without understanding what is specifically being asked. If you find a question or choice confusing rephrase the question in your one words.Be on the look out for concessions:In many cases, the author may have a strong voice towards a certain topic or aspect in the passages. The author might have a strong opinion towards certain aspects in a passage and argue for it throughout the passage but then the author might suddenly stop doing so and make subtle or drastic concessions to the opposing side which will weaken the arguments that were previously made in the reading comprehension passage. Make sure that you aren’t thrown by such concessions.Make use of the context:If the question asked is related to a specific line in the reading comprehension passage, it won’t help if you just go back and read the sentence. The thumb rule is to read at least one sentence before and after the aforementioned line.Zero in on the idea behind the longer passages:Majority of the reading comprehension passages that you will come across while taking the GRE will be short but on the off chance that you encounter one or two longer ones, it is advisable to focus more on the first and last paragraphs of the passage and find the big picture of the passage, since time is of the essence.Find the tone of the passage:The tone of the passage can be found using the choice of words or the turn of phrases used by the author. Even if the tone appears to be neutral, assume that it is complex and look for the tone. You can arrive at the tone by observing the diction or by asking the following questions:Does the author feel positively or negatively about a certain topic?What aspect of the topic does the author criticize?What concerns does the author raise through the passage?Which adverbs and adjectives does the author use to voice his opinion?Last but not the leastWatch your diet: An important factor which most students ignore to their detriment is their health and diet. This is very important both during your preparation and while taking the test. Ensure that you stick to a nutritious diet since you will need a lot of energy during your preparation. It is a good thing to avoid eating outside especially junk food, during your preparatory phase. Also, refrain from drinking, partying and taking recreational drugs a week or two before the Test day.P.S. If you are looking for study material I would recommend the following:GRE verbal prep - A definitive guideGRE Prep: Crack the Quantitative Reasoning SectionGre Prep: Crack the Analytical Writing Assessment Section EffortlesslyGood Luck!","I scored 336 on my first shot (V166 V170,) and 20 is about the number of days I actually spent on studying for it. However, I started with a good foundation. With my SAT history and intense workload at college, I scored 320+ on my first mock test after I reviewed the vocabulary — in other words, it took me nothing but memorizing a few words to get myself at around 320.People at different levels or from different backgrounds require different strategies and time investment to reach that 320 goal. Regardless, the 20 days I spent got me 15+ points further. I can’t tell you how to reach 320 without knowing much about your background and needs, but I can tell you how to utilize a shorter time period to make some good progress:Focus. The famous 80/20 Rule states that roughly 80% of your outcomes come from 20% of your inputs.[1] This applies to GRE as well. There will be areas on GRE where you can most quickly improve. When the time is limited, you need to focus on those areas to make the most progress. Take a few mock tests and find those spots, and work on them relentlessly.Make mistakes. Don’t worry about them at all. It is a good thing to find yourself making mistakes when you’re practicing than you do on the real test. When you practice, you want to expose all the possible ways you make mistakes, and then find ways to avoid them. The reality is, aside from the vocabulary, GRE hardly covers anything that esoteric. In many cases, it’s the silly mistakes you make that really keeps you from getting your dream score. Learning how to avoid those mistakes can allow you to improve quickly. You just need to identify them first, by making them.Analyze. Don’t just practice questions after questions. Think about them. Find patterns, find how you get them wrong, and find quicker ways to solve these questions. At the end of the day, it’s not the quantity of questions that you practiced on that matters the most, it’s how you treat them. Don’t just focus on getting the questions right, focus on how to get better.Consolidate. After you’ve practiced, made mistakes, and analyzed them, now it’s time to consolidate your takeaways. Make yourself a list of actions you can take during the actual test to help yourself perform better. This could include double checking your zeros, or being more alarmed of particular words, or things you tend to forget or overlook. Take a good look at them before you take the test.Many of my friends have asked me how I got the score I have. Frankly this is it.

GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5.

GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"

It is unique because, as the name suggests, it displays not just the meaning and the sentence of the word, but also a relevant image. After using it I found that its much easier to relate to the images, and hence remember them as compared to remembering sentences to get the meaning.Fun and easy way to build your vocabulary!  It gives you mnemonics with each word, which makes it much easier to remember meanings.Free GRE Vocabulary Flashcards It is another great, fun app which you can use, after you are done with/or as an alternative to the first one.If you have around 3–4 months, then only you should go for reading newspapers, novels and studying the books “Word Power Made Easy” by Norman Lewis.","As far as GRE vocabulary, this is a long time dedication printed process. If you want to crack verbal section of GRE you definitely need a huge vocabulary. Work on vocabulary is never a waste of time. It pays dividends in terms of your final GRE score. In order to enhance your vocabulary you must follow two pronged strategy -ConnectionImaginationThis will play very important role to increase your vocabulary. For instance - there is word “ Extirpate” . We can connect and imagine that. we can write that word like - extra stomach(pet in hindi). Now imagine if someone is having extra stomach then he needs to reduce that. You can visualize that with any real situation.Never learn word in isolation- Never learn any word in isolation. You can learn similar, rhyme words, same prefix and suffix words.Learn and make it habit - Whatever you learn daily make it a habit so that you may not forget them , use that word in daily normal conversation,official conversation etc. This method will help you to keep the word in memory.Read more - Reading is pivotal that should be in your habit and whatever word you are unfamiliar to, just try and connect it with the reference of the passage and line.If still you are unable to make meaning, can take help from dictionary.best of luck…!!","Many good ways to do it. One reliable way is the below one: Make it a habit of reading American newspapers ( like NewYorkTimes,WallStreetJournal)  daily because the words and the  style of writing are same as that which appear in the exam. By reading them regularly, you will not only learn new words but also will make you accustomed to their style. This way, you can easily guess the right word in the blanks, you can easily spot the purpose of the passage easily and much more. And keep giving mocks and keep practicing questions from  manhattan 5lb and verbal books or any material which provides exhaustive set of questions.

GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy !

Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How do I score 340 on the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-score-340-on-the-GRE,"Looking (TV series), GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exams and Tests",6,"This isn’t directly responsive to your question, but I wonder why you would want to waste precious days and weeks pursuing this goal. OK, if you enjoy mental challenges like this, perhaps it would be fun for you to try to get a 340 — and then you can go take the Mensa test and get another number to brag about.But if you think that getting a 340 on the GRE — instead of, say, a 320 — is going to get you into a good grad school, I think you may be disappointed, even if you do manage to get that 340.I can’t speak for every graduate program, of course, but over the years I have evaluated and rated hundreds of applications for PhD programs in Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science — among the top-rated CS programs in the world by almost any measure.And despite all this experience, I just had to go look up what a 340 score on the GREs means. I always look at the GRE percentile scores and not the arbitrary numerical scores, and so do most of my colleagues. If you’re from a good school that we know about, we look mostly at your grades (and at what courses you did well in), and not at the GREs.Also, we admit a lot of students from China and India who have good quantitative scores, but pretty weak verbal and writing scores. I always figure that, even if the person can communicate pretty well in English, taking the GRE in English is going to be unfairly hard for them, so I look mostly at the TOEFL scores to see if they can function in English.About the only time I pay serious attention to the GRE scores is if I can’t make sense of the undergrad university’s grading system, or if the GRE is so much lower than the applicant’s grades that it makes me suspicious.That’s just one data point, but if you’re tempted to spend time trying to optimize the last few points on your GRE score, I would strongly suggest spending that time on a research project instead, or reading a few more papers in the field you want to go into.","My answer is based on what I've gleaned from own experiences and from conversations with others who have scored 338 or above.Preparing for the examFirst, you should start out as a decent test-taker. Pre-preparation, you'll want to start out scoring at least 325-330 (if not higher) on your first couple of practice exams before deciding to aim for a 340.* Additionally, it helps to have taken and done well on other exams written by ETS, such as the SAT, if only to have familiarized yourself with the general style of ETS's question writing.Second, practice. Once you start consistently scoring at least 165-167 on each section, you have all the fundamentals down. You might want to brush up on a little bit of math or some vocabulary words that you're missing here and there, but otherwise it's practice all the way. Once you get up into the 336+ range, especially, the only thing that separates a 339-340 and a lower score is a couple mistakes. Consistency and practice are the difference-makers here.For this reason, I would strongly recommend doing computerized practice questions only (and there are services that offer more practice questions in the official computerized format than you could possibly need). You want to have the comfort of ""home-court advantage"" when taking a test—if the home team gets an additional 3-4 points per game per college basketball game, then being intimately familiar with the computerized test format might be the difference maker between a 339 and a 340. By the end, I was really fast at clicking the bubbles, marking questions, and navigating through the test in general. It might seem trivial, but the advantage of ""getting in the zone"" (not to mention saving a few seconds per section) is priceless.Test-day war planMake multiple full passes through each section. Strategy-wise, I took at least two passes through each quantitative reasoning section, doing the problems from scratch each time. With enough speed gained through practice, I was able to make a comfortable pass through each section in less than half the time allotted. It's definitely probable that most test-takers could get a 170 from doing just one careful pass (and maybe one check pass), but I felt that I maximized my chances (if only by a tiny bit) by doing the problems really quickly more than once.On the first and second passes, I would mark a question (and come back on a second or third pass) if I was slightest bit unconfident about my answer. On the second pass, especially, try your best to ignore what you did on your first pass; furthermore, I would recommend starting from the end of the section (the harder questions) first. This is extremely crucial for catching the small mistakes or consistent mis-readings of questions that often create one or two mistakes on the quantitative reasoning section. I would save a third pass just as a general sanity check or for one or two questions that I marked from the first two passes. If I felt that time was running down, I'd start checking the marked questions halfway through the second pass.Similarly, I would take at least two passes through each verbal reasoning section but wouldn't necessarily re-read the passages. Here, the emphasis was more on a couple of trickier questions (which I would mark during the first pass). It was harder for me to get a 170 on the verbal reasoning section but for a different reason: it was less about random mistakes and more about honing in on a few tricky questions. (A general strategy that applies to any test-taker is to shield out the answer choices when answering the passage-based questions, as the wrong answer choices only serve to distract—provide your own general response first before looking at and choosing among the answer choices.)Take frequent breaks. Even if I felt really good about a section I had just taken, I would always opt to take at least a short breather after that section.Pro tip: There's a long break in the middle of the test, but realistically you probably have enough time to drink water or use the restroom after any individual section. The ETS gives you a lot of time to read the general instructions at the beginning of each section (if I recall correctly, several minutes), and you can even click the button to request extra time to read the instructions, which you can do once per section. Honestly, unless you're fretting to begin the next section, I don't see any disadvantage to taking advantage of that time to ""reset"" and clear your mind before each section, especially if the previous section was a bit more hectic than you would have liked.Note that while some of the strategies I mention above are applicable to all test-takers, some are good only if you're looking to get a near-perfect scaled score (and otherwise could potentially be rather poor strategies if extreme accuracy is not your limiting factor, as you might be missing questions due to the rapid pace of making multiple passes).*I'm not saying it's not possible to get a 340 starting out with a lower score, depending on exactly how and why you got the lower score, but if you're starting far below a 330, shooting for a 340 starts to become less realistic and a matter of diminishing marginal returns on your time: the GRE is less important to grad admissions than the MCAT and SAT are to medical school and college admissions, respectively. Realistically, anything above a 330 is quite sufficient for admission to most top grad schools in the U.S. if your other credentials are good, especially if you're applying as a domestic student (though do note that many top math/engineering/physics programs desire a near-170 quantitative reasoning score as a sanity check). Even if you're looking to get a score in the 336-340 range, note that the grind to get from, say, a 330 to a 335 is arguably faster and less treacherous than that to get from a 336 to a 340.If you're dead-set on a 340, though, I'd start with the steps highlighted in the many excellent answers to How do I prepare for the GRE to score above 330?There are certainly accounts of people out there who have put hundreds of hours over many months preparing for the GRE, which is certainly warranted in some cases depending on their goals, but putting in the extra month of study to improve just to a couple points is not really worth it. Do more research. Get more job experience. Learn more about the world. Eat some pie.","GRE consists of the following sections:Analytical Writing – 2 sections or tasks“Analyze	an issue”“Analyze	an argument”Verbal Reasoning – 2 sections25 questions/sectionQuantitative Reasoning – 2 sections25 questions/sectionIt is not much difficult to score in quant. Manhattan and Kalpan are the best sourcesYour verbal ability accounts for two thirds of your score; quantitativeability accounts for the rest. To do well in GRE, you must ace thelinguistic side of the test.How do you do that?Cultivatea habit of reading extensively. Any book (my personal recommendation are the classics), magazines – TheEconomist, Reader’s Digest.newspapers – NewYork Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian(the best content lies in the editorials, and definitely not in the Page-3/entertainment section), websites and news sites (BBC has some of the finest content).Moving on to the Verbal Reasoning section. The finest tool you can equipyourself with, to crack this section is a vast vocabulary. Now, some of us are somehow blessed with a vast vocabulary, most of us,unfortunately, aren’t. That makes learning vocabulary our primary challenge in cracking GRE.How do I build my vocabulary?Extensive reading helps; but this is tedious method of getting there. There is extensive literature available on GRE specific vocabulary; various sources are give you this list. Kaplan’s and Barron’s have their long and condensed lists for you.Thebest of them all, however, is VocabSmith. (I must confess here that Irepresent VocabSmith). VocabSmith teaches you the words with meaning,usages and synonyms. VocabSmith uses the state-of-art RST algorithm,which is the most advanced learning methodology for vocabulary.Psychological research suggests that new words are learned best by repeated exposure to them, up to 4-7 times.VocabSmith’s RST algorithm governs your exposure to the words, in a frequency determined to be the most optimized, as suggested by proven psychological research. The algorithm further aligns this revision on the user’s difficulty in learning the words – you find a word difficult, no problem, VocabSmith revises it more for you. This way,VocabSmith ensures that your time spent on the tool maximizes your retention of the words, and associate with word usages.VocabSmith’s content has been prepared by veterans who’ve been in this industry for over 15 years. The list of words in each of its courses have been carefully chosen, so as to optimize your preparation for GRE. You could choose from the following three packages:GRE Complete – For the marathoners. This course contains the complete	GRE word list of 3500+ words.GRE High Frequency – For the medium-distance runners. This course contains a thoroughly-researched list of 1000+ words repeated often	in GREGRE Ultra High Frequency – For the sprinters. This course contains	400+ words that have appeared the most often in GRE.Itis available in both Android and iOS versions. Links are given below:iOS:	https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/...Android:	https://play.google.com/store/ap...","Lawrence Chiou’s answer is excellent, so I won’t repeat what he has said. Read his first, and I’ll add on more.Verbal:You are probably not going to score 340 without a large vocabulary. If you have a long time to prep, start reading lots of non-fiction and intellectual new sources like the Economist. If you have a weak vocabulary and short time to prepare, memorize an available list, but set your sights a bit lower.Process of Elimination is super important. Particularly when you need to pick two words that both fit the sentence *and* match. On the tricky questions, they like to throw in words that fit the sentence but do not have a pair. Eliminate them.Tone is very important. Look for positive and negative words and make sure your answer matches.Quantitative:You should have enough time to go through each question twice. Try to solve the problem in two different ways to make sure your answers are consistent and you didn’t miss a trap.It’s very important to back-solve. Almost all questions you can plug the answer in to solve for the initial conditions. This can be one of your two way.Use shortcuts to narrow down choices. eg. in a triangle the third side will always be less than the sum of the other two. Or the angles will sum to 180. On some questions, only one answer will meet these basic criteria and you won’t need to solve the problem completely.Test Day:Drink plenty of water.In your practice tests, you should be finishing the sections in less than 15 minutes. Use this time to get up, perhaps take a water/bathroom break and then review the questions in a fresh mindset (note: if you have trouble completing the sections in < 20 minutes, a 340 is probably unrealistic).Try and book your exam on a date/time when you will be in a good mental space (eg. not right before a holiday, morning/afternoon, Monday vs. Friday. When are you sharpest?)Dress comfortably but professionally. I found that wearing business casual put me in the right mind set. A psychological hack to put yourself in a focused, business-oriented mindset.Use the ‘mark’ function to mark questions you should triple-check.Don’t bother memorizing school codes. You can look up the school at the end of the test and if you really can’t find it, you can pay to send it afterward.If you are applying to business school, write the GMAT first. I found the Reading Comprehension, Critical Reasoning and Quantitative Problem Solving to be tougher on the GMAT. If you prepared for the GMAT, you will have to do little prep in these areas for the GRE."
GRE,What are the easiest ways to learn math and vocabulary for the GRE to score above 320?,https://www.quora.com//What-are-the-easiest-ways-to-learn-math-and-vocabulary-for-the-GRE-to-score-above-320,"GREedge, GRE Preparation, Vocabulary Development, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Exam and Test Advice, Exam and Test Preparation, How-to Question, Exams and Tests",29,"To thoseWho don’t have much time to prepare, such as those having a job (my case) or too much of college work.Preparing on their own, without any coaching. Without any hard books.Who are lazy. (Less euphemistically)Here’s my brief:(It’s quite a long read - TL; DR at the end)I was not able to do what they do, owing to the lack of time. These things should not let you down--“No time for Mock tests”: I did not take any (of the 3) mock tests fully - I only used to attempt both the Quant sections, review the mistakes, and ultimately end up preparing for Quant only till the day ended. I’d attempted Verbal only once (that too while triple-clicking and peeping at the meaning for each of the words that were unknown to me :P ) and gotten only 20 of 40 correct. This was before I’d started preparations, so I didn’t mind it much.LAST MINUTE Preparations: In spite of everyone telling me against it, I couldn’t leave the house in the morning without scrolling through my (mostly unprepared) word list, and the salient Quant mistakes notes.“Enough Sleep before the Day”: Didn’t have! :( Feeling underprepared, just twisting on the bed for hours without sleep!What I can make out nowAll that last minute anxiety, laziness towards Verbal, the last sleepless night, were all immaterial. For the most important thing is to be Calm & Concentrated during the exam. That’s all! :) Your score is already decided; a few months’ preparation would be puny in front of the all the Math/English that you’ve acquired during the past 20-25 years of your life.The post by Ananth Balasubramanian is the truest. Sincere thanks to him. :)[Here’s the link: GRE brief by Ananth Balasubramanian | Facebook]Suggested preparation material (i.e. the ones that I referred to)Manhattan 5 lb. (the hot favourite) for Quant - being a lover of Maths, I solved all of the problems and tests in this.ETS Official Guide - devour it completely! Burp!ETS Quant Practice and ETS Verbal Practice books - the best ones to understand the type & range of questions asked and to develop your own strategies.Magoosh Vocabulary Builder app - for the times when I used to take a break or while commuting or that eyes-wide-open-in-the-phone-light time before sleep.Quant tipsPractice all types of questions from all topics. Don’t even ignore simple Algebra questions like “1+3=?”, for there must be a trick involved. Even once would do, if you grasp things quickly.Then review the answers and keep jotting down the mistakes you commit. These should be helpful at the LAST MINUTE preparations. (For example, don’t ignore fractions and negative values in x2; double check DI questions; that new formula of ‘sample standard deviation’ etc.) If you have time, do review the answers to the correct ones too - there can be some wisdom provided there too, e.g. in Manhattan and ETS books.Verbal tipsPractise RC as much as you can. It’s not important that you finish the whole book of RC99. I did practise only about 15-20 essays from the books that I’ve mentioned. The important thing is to learn how to critically think about the questions and the choices. Every now and then, you’d have to reason with the choices like: “Hey! The passage does say that Apples are Bad. But it doesn’t state ‘specifically’ that they’re bad in taste. So eliminate.” Reasoning gets even more stringent than this. Learn to do it, and RC is your toy.Also, speed reading in RC helps a lot. Verbal sections might be found to be time-taking by you.SE and TC - Go with your instinct. Eliminate. Practice didn’t help me much I guess. But to be confident in the exam, do practise. :)AWA tipsI don’t think I’m the right person to speak about it. I only read a few samples from the ETS OG, on the day before D-day. I like writing, and so I could write quite much in the exam as well.All this I did within 10 days effectively. Lack of sleep didn’t bother me on the test day. (Might bother others, do sleep!)However, during preparations, I believe sleep matters - for whatever you learn needs the warmth of the pillow to be happy to stay in your brain... :)As much important are everyday chores and play - I used to play at least two games of Carrom everyday during my preparation. But DON’T do anything that brings that guilt in you of having wasted time.On Test DayHad slept only for 4 hours the night before, awoke at 6:30 AM, had only one banana for breakfast, and reached the venue at 7:30 AM. To my surprise, security check had already begun! :O Plus, to add to the torment, the ‘Prometric Intro video’ was playing on the TV there in loop! Grrr!AWA topics were good, had ample thoughts to write. Time is also enough for you to write 400-500 words.Happy to see the Quant section first! :D Got all the answers. However, it was trickier and lengthier than the second Quant section - so I knew that it was experimental.And most of the verbal passages I got were related to Science - Astronomy, Chemistry, Botany etc. Lucky, for I love to read about those. :)A Little Time Hack: Don’t press the Continue button when the section finishes. Take deep breaths. Prepare your mind to shift from Q to V or V to Q. Then press Continue and enjoy an official break of 60 more seconds ... :P (Had read this somewhere, so implemented.)Break time: Snickers. No wonder. (I think ETS should write this in the GRE conventions’ PDF now)All went smooth. And the score screen. My eyes went to the Quantitative section first: 170. Emotionless. Fine. Expected. Then they turned to Verbal section: 159. I added it to my Quant score and... “WTF! It’s becoming 329! Perhaps my brain is too tired to do simple addition now”, I’d said to myself. I did the Math again. And then again on the yellow rough sheet - that’s when it settled in!I smiled, filled in the Universities, and went straight to my friends waiting for a party. :)TL; DRKNOW the question types; PRACTISE until you start getting the answers correct; CHILL often: most importantly, during the exam.All the Best! :)[If anyone has any further queries, I'd be happy to help. :) ]——————————————————————————————————————————Update | May 22, 2016Admitted in Texas A&M University, College Station, to the M.Eng. in Construction Engineering & Management program!Happy as Hell!! :D——————————————————————————————————————————Update | June 30, 2017Working for one of the largest construction companies in the US!Happier!! :D :D","Dear GRE Aspirant!Two key phrases caught my attention in your question: “easiest ways” and “above 320”. Let me begin with the 2nd phrase since it is the more important among the two.An above 320 score is the popular benchmark for the success of your application – although there are many more factors to it. Going by the consensus, here is how a Good and a Great GRE score may look like.Good ScoreGreat ScoreAdditionally, why don’t we draw some inference from the statistics for admission to some top-notch colleges in the U.S.:The statistics shown above will convince you of the importance of securing section-wise efficient scores in the GRE. A 165 in Quant, coupled with a 155 in Verbal makes 320, but need not serve the best outcome with respect to your target university. Coming to the other phrase (i.e., easiest ways), you must understand that easy comes from comfort – and that comfort comes from two things: Ability & Alacrity. The better you are at something, the easier it feels. Again, the more prepared you are for something – the easier it becomes. All this philosophy is to help you understand the importance of Planning & Preparation. These two Ps make GRE easier to tame. We will come to this soon!Tame your VerbalLet’s begin with a few things to focus on for your Verbal section:Without discounting the importance of the 3500 high frequency words for GRE, you must also refer Barron’s 333. These are apparently the more frequent ones to occur.The Verbal section of the GRE is not about memory, word power or vocabulary. It is more about analogy, context, and comprehension. Hence, invest in learning the context for each word.Select a handful of words every week – and read at least 5 blogs/articles in context to each such word. This reinforces enough context around the word – making it almost unforgettable.The old strategies of relying on mnemonics, visual/audio, root words, theme based words, synonyms for context, etc. are still extremely effective and relevant. Utilize technology where you can, and rely on building your Verbal foundations using visual & associative methods of learning. Apps like WordBot, Flashcards, are extremely effective in this regard.Develop the habit of speed reading. Only 20% of a sentence is enough for context. This will help you achieve great speed and accuracy (since you wouldn’t be affected by random words in the sentence).Conquer QuantNow, a few hacks for the Quant section:Master Mental Math. A large subset of questions you encounter would be intense with lots of smaller problems leading to the final solution. Mastering Mental Math techniques like Vedic Math etc. will take away the weeds from the path.Practice and practice hard, with an intent to solve any question you encounter within 90 seconds. Some solutions could be shorter, say 25 seconds.Value your time, but do not rush. Read between the options available and often you will see through the traps GRE sets for all.Learn the art of IGMO, i.e., Intelligent Guessing and Moving On. GRE does not penalize a wrong answer. If the questions seem a bit wavering for you, resort to IGMO.Pick concepts and solve questions based on them. This will enable you to approach each question with an intent to build its back/spine. Once you strengthen the spine, you can take it all!Always try to build a Flow or Diagram for questions. Each question just lays out the facts in front of you. What can be confused by words, can be disseminated by figures!Learn to use the Online Calculator. It is an extremely underrated gift/lenience GRE offers. Most people end up solving square roots on paper. Act smarter and use a calculator. All of this is best done when you have a Plan and Preparation in place.How does Planning help?Peter Drucker said: “You can't manage what you can't measure”. A plan will help you stay focused and on the sprint. No plan is fool-proof, but a study plan will ensure you are aware of your progress. It will help you mobilize more resources when needed, and prioritize better.Take a look at the below figure to understand the same.Note that the above data corresponds to aspirants who had invested and dedicated themselves to a Tight Study plan and a Learning Tracker, in their quest for a 320+ score in GRE.Sample Study Plan Structure based on time period:1 month study plan structureAllocate at least 4 hours a day to prepare for GRE, diligently – without fail.Focus on the toughest problems and concepts.Compare your progress with peers and steer your preparation plan daily based on the same.Take as many timed and test-environment simulated tests as may be possible.Be clear of where you need help and reach to the Personal Coach without any remorse.3 months study plan structureEnforce Time Management strategies like 2 minute rules for every question.Work up stamina for 4 hour tests, by taking regular proctored and simulated tests.Focus a lot on deciphering and finding the way through long RCs and passages.Identify weak areas/concepts, and scheduling help sessions for the same.Build a diligent Word consumption strategy (e.g. WordBot, Flashcards, etc.).Stay well-versed with as many axioms and formulae pertaining to Geometry as possible.6 months study plan structureA more relaxed approach to building core concepts.Heavy focus on building reading habit.Periodicals and editorial sections of top/acclaimed journals are a must. Additionally, classic novels and books are welcome.A daily focus on assimilating 10-20 new words from the high frequency list of words.Weekly proctored tests to analyze weak areas.Building good arithmetic and quick math skills.Strong focus on practising Data Interpretation and Sentence Equivalence questions, given the time in hand to master the same.It is consistently quipped that 90 days should be a good period to enable your GRE prep. Having said that, you could just get double sure with a 180 day study plan!Nothing gets easier than following a time tested study plan, especially when someone else out there dedicates all their hours to build your excellence.Do not let too much information confuse your choices. Think logically, and you will see that sense prevails by following a stringent study plan.All the best!","I scored a 320+ with Q:170.GRE is a tricky exam which just can't be randomly answered. I started two months prior to the exam. The first thing I did was to research about the books that you will be reading from and here is my view about books:ETS GRE Official Book- This book is a must, it gives insights to what actual GRE will be and is the closest to GRE level. It contains all information about the exam, practice sets in verbal and Quants and AWA and two written tests. Apart from written tests, you get a CD which contains powerpep softwareManhattan 5LB- This is a comprehensive book, has exhaustive practice sets for RCs, SE and TC and gives you tips to study. I found Quants from Manhattan easy most of the time . It is a recommended book for verbalPrinceton Review- This book is for beginners, I would recommend this book only to those who haven't had a chance to verse well with English ,the level is easier than GRE for both Quants and verbal. Don't buy this book if you are well versed with Quants and Verbal.As far as my schedule goes, I had to manage it along with my undergrad( Engineering). I would give 4–5 days a week for verbal ,esp RCs. It's always better to work in group for verbal, discuss with your friends, or your GRE teacher if you have joined tutorials. Focus on vocab, but not too much ,GRE is no longer vocab centric , Manhattan 1000 words, Princeton 1409 and magoosh flash cards are enough for this. Start with your vocab early,read and understand words while you are free, or in your commute. TC and SE are scoring questions ,I focussed more on them rather than RCs.Coming to Quants, I just used Manhattan 5LB. Since I appeared for JEE Mains engineering entrance exam, which has much higher level mathematics, I didn't find the need to study for GRE, as Quants is more about your basic maths and alertness to tricky questions.Lastly, I gave a lot of mock exams, 6 Manhattan tests from their portal which costs around $40. 2 Princeton tests and 2 ETS Powerprep. I found Manhattan tests extremely helpful esp in Quants, on other hand I found Princeton verbal easy and Quants nearly same as GRE . Powerprep has two tests and both are of utmost importance, test 1 seems easier than test 2. Your final exams marks can be nearly +/-3 of Powerprep 2 obv not without exceptionsDon't over study, be calm and chilled for GRE, study regularly, converse with your friends in English or maybe play a vocab game. I used to play vocab game in magoosh with my friends by challenging them.All the best for your GRE!Protip: Anytime during exam if you feel that the level of questions has fallen down, realize that you performed bad in the previous section as GRE is adaptive. Rejoice if the level is same or harder :p","The graduate record exam or the GRE is calculated out of 340(170 in quants and 170 in verbal)Now to get over the score bandwidth of 320 ,one must score atleast a 160 in each of the two sections.NOTE: If one is an engineering student,one can easily go above 160 in quants ,however if one has not touched mathematics beyong grade 12 then one needs to follow an arduous schedule of bringing all the mathematical concepts back in track.1) GO BACK TO THE BASICS: For quants basics, MANHATTAN REVIEW 5LB is the best.It will not only make the weak areas strong,but will aquaint you with any all the types that you could be presented with in the actual GRE.For verbal, more than knowledge of vocabulary ,a test of analytical evaluation based on which word will suit in the blank is followed. Henceforth it is strongly suggested to go through the MAGOOSH APP .Moreover the usage of the words in the apt places can be best learnt by reading from the ATLANTIC,NEW YORKER.2)PRACTICE: Once you are done recapitulating with these,one should practice in real test time conditions.For this one can purchase Manhattan 6 practice tests .The average of these tests is a giveaway of your score in the actual gre(+ or- 2)ETS gives access to 2 tests .Even the scores obtained here is a rough estimate of the actual score one would get on their test day.3) MAINTAIN YOUR CALM AND STRATEGISE: On the test day it is very important to have a healthy breakfast , read any article (to ensure that the RC you get is not the 1st article you are reading).If one is not performing well in the first sections,motivation and pep talk oneself that the best is yet to come and this could have been the experimental section.Moreover if one is weak in certain areas,it is better to leave them to the last as a bird in hand is worth two in the bush.Ensure you answer all questions as there is no negative marking in the GRE."

I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How do I best prepare for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-best-prepare-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions",39,"Hi! I have taken the General GRE exam in March 2017 and scored 329/340 with 163 in Verbal and 166 in Quantitative. I will tell you my experience and in general some tips as to how to fare well on the exam. Nevertheless, preparation strategies vary from person to person.If you want to get an idea as to where you stand even before you start your preparation, I would suggest you to take a free mock test online. I would recommend the one offered by Galvanize. It's not a full test, but has one Verbal section and one Quantitative section. You just need to spend an hour and you would get an idea when you check your scores as to where you made mistakes and which concepts you need to learn better. This, in my opinion, embarks your preparation for GRE!The most important thing to do is to first book your test date. Until and unless your test date is booked, you would not get the requisite motivation to start your preparation. That was what I did. I first scheduled my test and then took the mock to see where I stood. I scored 302/340 in the mock test. I was not at all prepared. So the results were as expected. I found out the concepts I needed to study and started working on them.Talking about how much time you need to invest preparing for the test, it is totally dependent on what you do. If you are an engineering student or a mathematics student or someone taking math courses and constantly staying in touch with the subject, I assure you that Quantitative section would be a cakewalk! At the same time, I would like to emphasize that ETS has raised the bars for Quantitative section and it is not as trivial as it once seemed to be (I'm not generalizing anything here; whatever I say is what I opine). If you want to start from scratch and study everything throughly, I'd highly recommend enrolling for some online GRE coaching.You can subscribe for Magoosh as it would prep you up for the toughest questions - questions that are too tough that ETS might not consider asking them- which is a very good thing as you would find the actual test pretty easy! You can take a subscription for three months or six months depending on what is ideal for you and depending on when you have scheduled your test. Do not think of it as a waste of money because in the worst case scenario where you do bad in your first attempt, you might end up wasting more money for your second attempt! So it's okay to spend some money when necessary because it's worth it. :)Practice all the material religiously, and work everyday. Make sure you have the ETS official book with you and also download the Powerprep software from ETS website. Set a target, say, that you would complete your first round of preparation in a month and then take the first test on the Powerprep software. Depending on your score, you would know where you stand. You can then improve your score by focusing more on areas where you lost marks. Take the second test one week before your actual test date after you think you're fully prepared. That test is relatively tougher than the first one. Spend the last one week practicing rigorously.VerbalVocabulary plays a crucial role in Verbal section, but, remember that it is not everything. It contributes to about 20% of your score on verbal section. The most important aspect is practicing comprehensions and text completions. GRE is an exam which you can excel by practicing more and more problems! That's the key to scoring high on GRE. So don't spend too much time simply learning words. Instead, practice more questions and continue learning words. This approach is more helpful.QuantitativeThe key to scoring high on quantitative is practice and practice and practice! Also, remember that the exam would put you under a time pressure. So practice with time and try to do as many questions as you can with minimum number of mistakes. Every question is worth the same score. So focus more on getting questions right than on somehow answering all the questions.Analytical WritingIt would suffice to score above 3.5 in this section, but I would suggest you to spend some time and get a better score. It's not all about getting a reasonable score but it's about getting a decent and deserving score. If you're good at essay writing and arguments, you would hardly need to spend any time for this section. Otherwise, you need to practice writing and the more you practice, the better you get at it. ETS asks questions only from the given pool of essays. So make sure to check them out. I have practiced several topics from the pool of essays and scored 5/6 in this section.There are websites that have collections of GRE preparation books including Kaplan, Baron's, Manhattan, Princeton and old ETS books. So try to get them and practice as much as you can! :)Finally, I would say practice makes your GRE score perfect! I mean it literally, a perfect score of 340 is attainable with practice. :)All the best!PS: I have forgotten to mention this. In order to improve vocabulary on a long-term basis, do study Word Power Made Easy by Nornan Lewis. But this book doesn't cover several GRE words! So please download the app called “Painless GRE”. It has around 4000 words. Once you're done learning them, most of your vocabulary prep is done! :)","Be sure to register early for your GRE exam so that there is enough time to process any necessary paperwork, and so that you can take the exam at the center of your choice and at your desired time and date.

With a little planning and foresight, it will suddenly start looking orderly, logical and attainable. GRE preparation is a rigorous mental workout, which builds your accuracy, timing and confidence after consistent practice. One needs to train his/her mind to ingrain the concepts, techniques and strategies that are essential to crack GRE, and be able to invoke them during the exam. Also, preparation necessitates one to strike a right balance between study and breaks. Breaks serve as revitalizers to escape from unexciting routine of daily preparation, and if not taken in time, can lead to information overload and eventual burnout.Reaching a score plateau can be quiet a frustrating reality. The key is to keep pressing forward with increased positivity, better focus and fine-tuning your study plan to make the most of it. The idea is to reach the Peak after having worked on your accuracy, timing yourself appropriately and scoring high in practice tests. Once your score hits a point you have set your mind on, it is the most opportune moment to take GRE.You may want to take care of these little things to ensure success in the GRE:Your brain has a level of saturation beyond which its efficiency starts reducing. Take regular breaks and let your brain refresh and recharge itself. Once that happens, you will be able to bounce back and achieve much more.Set a right rhythm for GRE. Just cramming and practicing like a maniac will not work. You need to follow a steady strategy of learning-understanding-analysing-practicing-taking mock test followed by a well-deserved break.Monitor your progress in terms of your timing, accuracy and score continuously.Consistent practice is always better than last minute rigors. HOW TO CRACK GREMake a concrete, but realistic study plan and try to stick to it. It will put you in the right trajectory of discipline, where you will start to take your study as seriously as you take your dentist’s appointment after an excruciating toothache. HOW TO CRACK GREWhile you are self-motivated to study the subjects you are good at, you need to bury your head like the proverbial ostrich and practice the subjects you are not so fond of. Facing and overcoming your weak areas will make you better equipped and more confident.Over exertion and last minute cramming can prove detrimental to your scores. Make sure you are not stressed out, get enough sleep and eat healthy food before the exam day. HOW TO CRACK GREFollowing a routine over a period of time, taking practice tests at exactly the same time as your GRE slot does a lot of good to not only set your biological clock, but also gives you a subconscious training for taking the GRE.Divide your time assiduously. Do not keep reading one subject continuously. It is wise to alternate between two or different subjects to keep your interest level alive.GRE score is not a measurement of your intelligence, but is an indicator of how well planned, dedicated and positive you are as a person. Do not let GRE blues knock you down. Take it with a composed and forward looking approach.For more information on GRE/TOEFL/IELTS/GMAT, please visithttp://www.collegepond.com/resou...MS in US 2019 || Collegepond"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How do I get 330 in the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-get-330-in-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Exam Strategies",32,"GRE is not a test of your intelligence. It's more about how well you are able to hack the exam pattern and temperament.To go from 320 or 325 to 330/330+ makes all the difference and every point needs to be earned.Verbal: Assuming most people appearing for GRE from India are engineers or atleast from STEM background, Verbal gives nightmares to everyone. Blame it on our schools who taught us to mug up answers in English.Vocab: Don't be lazy about Vocab! It pays rich dividends. Good vocab prep means Sentence Equivalence and Text Completions part done so 8/20 questions taken care of. It helps tremendously in improving AWA quality, understanding RCs and TOEFL writing too. Start slowly and build up from there. Start with 333 High frequency word list, then move on to 800 word list, then 2000 and so on. 10 days prior to GRE focus on 800 word list. It helps the most. (If you are preparing for GRE under severe time constraints, Barron’s800 word list is your saviour). 90% of words on my GRE were from list and I was able to solve all questions by process of elimination because I knew all options or all but one in worst case scenario. There are several apps& websites available like : Magoosh Flashcards, Quizlet, Memrise etc. They have different formats. Pick what suits you the best. My personal favourite was Memrise because reviewing words already learnt is as important if not more as compared to learning new words. Set short targets such learning 20 new words.Reading Comprehensions: pace yourself well while reading. First reading should be mostly skimming through the text. If you don't understand something don't fret. You don't need to understand the whole passage to crack it. Don't trust instincts/gut feeling/memory either. Read every option and verify with relevant parts of passage. (Paraphrasing may help if you are really quick at reading). GRE tries to trick you by twisting/omitting/adding usually a word in the options which isn't in the passage. Thumbrule: eliminate any negative/out of context/ controversial options. More the practice and mock tests, better will be your RCs part.Quant:Manhattan 5 pound is a great book to start off and tackle questions of varying difficulty. Note: Don't skip Advance Quant part. Due to adaptive nature of tests you may get difficult questions in 2nd quant so it's a good idea to get used to it.How to avoid silly mistakes? By accepting them. Whenever I made a mistake in a mock test, instead of classifying under the broad banner of silly mistakes, I would write it down. Example “I calculated % instead of %change” etc.Utilise all 35 mins. Recheck every answer, using substitution or something. It really helps to eliminate silly mistakes.AWA: Usually we just have to clear a cut off for AWA.Read sample essays initially.Practice writing under timed conditions so you know how to manage those 30 mins.Leave 4–5 mins at end for proofreading twice. We tend to ignore spelling mistakes during first reading.General:Practice a lot of mocks with timed conditions so you are accustomed to various exam formats (number and sequence of verbal and quant sections)Keep a track of progress and keep reviewing mistakes.GRE is a test of temperament. Practice sitting in a chair in front of a computer and keeping your brain in full concentration mode for 4 hours at a stretch!Cheers! All the best!","The BasicsFirst off, let me assume you haven't completed an Engineering degree in a First-World Anglophone country, because a lot of my advice probably wouldn't apply to you then. I also don't think you'd have any problems scoring 330 as easy as pie because of the way you've been educated, so this post won't apply to you then. If you haven't however, a score of 330+ on the GRE signifies one of two things: You're either exceptionally well-rounded in both the Verbal and the Quantitative aspects of your education, meaning you won't lose more than 10 points aggregate in all your sections combined. There's a few people I know who're this way despite their Third-World upbringing. Hats off to them.Or, as I was, you're talented enough to score 170/170 on only one of your sections, and you've prepared well enough and done what's required on test-day not to lose more than 10 points on your other section. This was me. I knew I would get 169-170 on my Quants all along, it was all about damage limitation on GRE Verbal (which I wasn't very good at) and making sure I didn't squander more than ten points on test day. I succeeded, but not without some serious doubts along the way.So the objective is clear. You've got to avoid losing more than 10 points on test-day, Verbal and Quants combined. Let me talk about how I managed to accomplish that feat and how you can do the same.GRE VerbalFor me, Verbal was far and away the most difficult of all three GRE Sections, simply because of the limitations in my vocabulary and the types of questions that I encountered when I practiced for the GRE. If you're in the same boat, you'll fully understand how preparing for GRE Verbal can sometimes fill you with doubt and depression, because you've simply got no idea about what the right answer choice could be. The way I see it, the most crucial aspect to mastering GRE Verbal is not how much time you spend preparing. It hasn't even got much to do with how many words you know.The most crucial skill on GRE Verbal is Context.What does that mean? Basically, you need to know how the different words in English you're already familiar with can be used in differing contexts to provide alternate meanings. This is how you should inculcate context into your GRE Preparation:First things first. Buy a complete prep book for GRE Verbal. I chose Kaplan GRE Premier, but only because that was the book somebody else recommended to me. Barron's and ETS are more than good enough as well.Go through all the question types, tips and practice questions provided in at least one of these books. Doing so will ingrain the format of the question paper and the probable words you're likely to come across on the day of the test itself. If you make a mistake in answering a question, write that down in a separate booklet, understand why you made that mistake (unknown word, wrong context etc.) and make sure it doesn't happen again.I would also recommend going through all the resources available on the Magoosh website (https://gre.magoosh.com/) as well as the apps they've got for GRE Verbal, available for smartphones. They really helped brush up my vocabulary.I've also covered GRE Verbal Preparation in more detail here:What can I do to improve my verbal score in the GRE from 153 to 160+?GRE QuantsI didn't need to spend a lot of time preparing for the Quantitative Section of the GRE, partly because it was just 10th Grade Math, and partly because I knew I had more pressing issues to deal with a.k.a Verbal. But if you feel like you need to do better in Quant, there's really no substitute for practice. The books that I've mentioned previously have all got chapters devoted to GRE Quants as well, so getting questions to practice with shouldn't be a problem. Work on the mathematical concepts that you'll need for the test, improve your time management skills, and you'll be fine.Analytical WritingAgain, AWA wasn't especially relevant to my GRE Preparation since I'm going to be applying for an MS in an Engineering discipline, so anything above 4.0/6.0 was fine by me. There are two kinds of essays you'll have to write on test-day, 30 minutes each, with slightly different writing styles. The best way to improve your essay writing skills is to read the sample essays that're given in your prep books, and practice using similar words when you write your own pieces. This goes without saying, but please make sure your essays are devoid of any grammatical/spelling mistakes, as those kinds of errors tend to be looked upon very poorly. Lastly, here's an here's an extensive guide written by the lads over at CrunchPrep on scoring 330+ on your GRE.Hope this helps :)","Here’s how I scored 330+ with a 3 week preparation plan!It is important to understand that the GRE is very different as compared to the other exams we are used to giving, talking from an Indian’s perspective. Blind hard work will not serve any purpose and sometimes will be counterproductive.ETS (the company that conducts the GRE) wants to convince you that your score is a measure of how good you are at ‘critical thinking’, but in reality it is only a measure of how good you are at giving the GRE. So, fortunately for us, the more you practise in the correct way, the better you become at giving the GRE.The Correct Way (in my experience) :Quality > Quantity. Always. Please do not spend 10+ hours a day mechanically solving problems and forgetting about them as you move forward. This will cause you to plateau at a certain skill level. The key is small incremental improvements.For me, the ideal way was a simple 3 step process :1.	Solve problems in small sets, around 20(+5 || -5) questions per set.2.	Check your answers. See the solutions, understand them thoroughly.3.	After checking all, recap the questions you got wrong, why, and what you learnt from them. This is extremely important.Let’s jump into the schedule now, shall we?Pre-prep phase (1 week) :Okay, I lied, it’s not really 3 weeks, but this pre-prep phase won’t take more than two hours of your time per day, and what’s more, you can easily do this while you eat or just before sleeping.What is to be done? Words, Words and more Words.Spend this week learning the words from the following apps :1.	Barron’s 11002.	Magoosh Flash Cards (around 1000 words)3.	Manhattan Essential Words (around 500 words)Vocabulary is essential to understanding the Reading Comprehensions as well as the sentence completions, so please complete this before moving ahead!Week 1 :Congratulations! The boring part is done. This week, let’s do :1.	4 Practice Tests2.	Practise each type of question in isolation. For example, do 20 Text Completions in one set. This will help you to identify weaknesses to work on.3.	Brush up all the shortcuts and maths formulae that you encounter.(Online Magoosh article exists)Week 2 :This week, let’s move forward with :1.	6 Practice Tests.2.	Do mixed practice sets now (All types of problems together), to simulate the actual GRE scenario.3.	Strictly time your tests and practice sets. Keep 5 minutes per section as a buffer. Identify which type of questions you are slow at. Work on them.Week 3 :Buckle up, this is your final lap :1.	8 practice tests.2.	Start reading AWA essays online, as well as general structuring tips. A lot of video material is available online. Practise a few essays if necessary.3.	Revise the Vocabulary words and mathematical formulae.At the end of this schedule, you should be ready to face the GRE. So be confident, sleep well before the paper and ohh, don’t forget to carry a jacket. It’s freezing in there.Thanks for reading!

GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5.

GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,"Which is the best GRE Online Program: Magoosh, GRE Edge, Crack Verbal, Chalkstreet or Galvanize test prep?",https://www.quora.com//Which-is-the-best-GRE-Online-Program-Magoosh-GRE-Edge-Crack-Verbal-Chalkstreet-or-Galvanize-test-prep,"Crack Verbal, Galvanize Test Prep, Gre Edge, ChalkStreet, Magoosh, GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions",73,"Since I didn’t enroll with Magoosh or Crack Verbal or Chalkstreet or Galvanize, I can’t speak for them although I did use the Magoosh vocab app which was good and precise. But I can speak for GREedge as I was enrolled in one of their programs. The experience was definitely good as I recently took the GRE and scored 323 and 4 in AWA.When you enroll with GREedge, they give you two SFAs (Student Facilitator and Analysts) who work with you throughout the process. They constantly remind you of your goals for the week, things you have pending and other stuff. They give you an idea about what things to read to improve your comprehensive reading skills (which is pivotal in an exam like GRE) with respect to the GRE. In a nutshell, they are really helpful pushing you to be consistent.Their “Learning Tracker” is a good place where various tools are there for your disposal, like the “Ask a doubt” feature or different wordlists or the dictionary app which focuses on GRE words. Everything is neatly organised and the best part is you can work on it from anywhere anytime. They provide you a huge amount of material both in quant and in verbal and it is up to you to use it. Also, they tell you to set a target score in quant and in verbal and they provide you statistical data showing where you stand among the different students who have achieved the target score set by you. So, it gives you a fair idea regarding how much more effort you need to put subject wise and topic wise. Also, they frequently conduct seminars where different people talk about different techniques which can be implemented in different sections of the exam or about their experiences regarding GRE and MS in general. So, that helps too.The most striking feature of GREedge is their “Wordbot” app where they provide you a set of words with pictures describing their meanings. Now, you may not remember the meaning of a certain word, like “appalled” for instance, but you’ll certainly remember the appalled expression of Brad Pitt which is shown in the picture describing the word. My point is you can retain pictures more easily than words. And it helps, at least in my case it did. And not a single word in my GRE was outside the set of words in Wordbot.Overall, it was a rewarding experience for me. And lastly, it is always up to you to take maximum use of the resources of any program. I understand it becomes hard especially if you are working on a job, but it helped me. And, as someone has already said, it ultimately boils down to the amount of effort you make.So, all the best!","I Galvanize is a good option for GRE preparation. ( My GRE Score: 306/340)In the first place, there was no specific cause for choosing Galvanize and I opted for it reading some of the reviews in the internet which told mentioned provide a pretty good course material designed to help you achieve your target score.After completing my journey with Galvanize I am putting forward my personal opinion for it as your GRE Guide.

Although, Galvanize does have their own pool of words, but somehow I liked Magoosh app which may be due to the reason that I had already started learning from it before I took Galvanize.According to me, I feel that the best strategy for cracking GRE would be to practice Manhattan 5 lb book and give the corresponding section tests from Galvanize which would help you to highlight your progress considering the time limit factor.Finally, summarizing the pros and cons of Galvanize:-PROS:Structured Material: All the sections (Verbal and Quant) are nicely divided that help you brush through and be thorough with the different topics.Reasonable Pricing.There are webinars covering each topics in detail, from the basics of each chapter of quant to the details of tricks and tips for verbal section.

GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,Is it true that GRE in the month of January of any year is the easiest and then difficulty level rises per month?,https://www.quora.com//Is-it-true-that-GRE-in-the-month-of-January-of-any-year-is-the-easiest-and-then-difficulty-level-rises-per-month,"GRE General Test, GRE Prep Club, GRE Forum, GRE Vocabulary, GRE Score, GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",23,"GRE stands for Graduate Record Examinations. The GRE General Test administered by ETS (Educational Testing Service), is a not-for-profit company. The exam is used to assess student’s Quantitative and Verbal aptitudes and is required for admission to many graduate programs along with some masters programs.It isn’t a true thing that GRE test is specifically easy in January than all other months because GRE test is conducted and designed by ETS on a regular basis. The reason for it is that GRE test is conducted almost on a daily basis in different parts of world. The level of difficulty in this test depends on the type of vocabulary used and the extent to which mathematical problems are stated. But it is true at some point that this exam only gets tougher due to a huge competition between candidates confessing from all around the world. This mostly happens before the start of fall semester in months of July to September when the competition gets hard.In my personal opinion, start preparing for GRE on your best level instead of worrying about it’s difficulty. Prepare for it on a level which can help you make your mark in the test and achieve your goal. Your mind should be test focused so that you can undergo each problem with efficiency, whether easy or difficult in the test.","Short Answer: No (can also mean that it can’t be estimated)Longish Answer:As you might know GRE is adaptive, so difficulty during the test is set by you. Apart from that, the difficulty we’re aware of is reported by our friends who give the test (since online you find people from a huge subset). And friends don’t give GRE every month, so even that can’t be a good estimator. Also people who attempt the test on multiple occasions may find it easier in the subsequent attempts. If they don’t, then maybe they were dealt a harder set of questions (which has nothing to do with the month). Or maybe they couldn’t handle the pressure of the exam.Though people do say that year on year, the exam seems to be getting a bit more difficult, within a calendar year, month shouldn’t be a determining factor of the difficulty.","Hello Priya, Thanks on the A2A. The examination is adaptive- the level of difficulty of the second section is based upon one's performance in the first section. In addition to this, there are also other factors like the some research section(s) being added and one cannot know which section is a research section ( your performance on it is not counted) and which one is not.Moreover, the questions are also distinct. On a relativistic scale (comparison) the quantitative section is “easier” than the Verbal section. The advantage with the GRE examination is that a slot for booking vthe examination can be done through out the year.If you have any further queries, you can private message me- I would be glad to clarify them.Best Regards","Note that I retired in 2002, so my answer is based on old information. That said: no, the difficulty of the GRE General Test is not designed to change from month to month or even year to year.Actually, all GRE test forms must meet statistical standards—set by the program—so that the GRE test form taken in any month or year is statistically comparable to the GRE test form taken in any other month or year. That’s how your parent could take the GRE in 1994, for example, while you could take it in 2019, and the scores you each attain will be comparable.I hope this helps you understand why there are no difficulty-level differences in the GRE General Test. The same also goes for any GRE Subject Test."
GRE,How can I increase my GRE score?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-increase-my-GRE-score,"GRE Score, GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",12,"311 is definitely not a bad score(in general). Unfortunately u have mentioned nothing about your profile. Also you have not mentioned about current branch and your intended major branch. So giving advice is a bit difficult.First of all doing masters in US/Canada, is totally different from studying in India. Since you have given GRE you might be aware of the admission process, so I won’t elaborate on it. But the important thing to know is that, while applying for master, they not only see your GRE & TOEFL scores, but also your extra curricular activities like academics, research papers, internships, social work, Good Projects, SOP, LORs, are also considered. I will elaborate on each of these individually.First for applying to any ‘good’ US university, you need to have good academics (irrespective of your major). Academics are going to play a major role in your admission. If you have good academics(ie. NO BACKLOGS and good percentages/pointer) then surely it would be easier to get admission in a good college. Good academics prove that you are a very good student academically and they won’t hesitate you to give you an admit.Second, internships and research papers are going to add weightage to your profile. Having a 1–2 internship or 1 research paper would definitely add to your chances of getting into a better college. They prove that you are interested in hardwork and research field, so they won’t mind admitting you to their college. The internship and/or research papers, prove beneficial in majors such as Computer Science or Electronics branch. There are too many students applying for these branches and in order to make your profile stand out from the scores of other profiles from across the globe, internships/research papers will definitely help you out.Third, people in USA definitely believe in social work, and it has a high importance if you have participated in any social activity(and have a certificate for it). It definitely will help you improve your profile.Fourth, SOP and LOR’s also play a important role. If you have a good SOP then you have the advantage. Also try to convince top faculties like senior professors, HOD or even Principal to recommend your name (to the university you want). This would definitely add advantage to your profile.Lastly, if you have experience of working on projects or have experience of working in some good company then it would definitely help. This is especially necessary if you are applying for CS branch as your major. Also your final year project is of great importance. And if you have extra certifications, like Oracle or Microsoft(for CS), CISCO(for electronics), AUTOCAD(mech and civil), then also your profile will get an upper hand over others.NOW YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY I GAVE SO MUCH DESCRIPTION OF ALL THESE THINGS.DON’T GET NERVOUS BECAUSE OF GRE SCORE OF 311.If you have the above things then you need not take the GRE again. Suppose you have 2 things like very good academics(You are in top 5 of your current univ) and have a good internship(of 1 or 3 months) or a research paper under your belt, then you need not retake your GRE. It is a very good score and you can definitely compete a student for a seat who has GRE score of 322(hands down). So you definitely need to check where you stand in all these, which all of the above mentioned “things” highlight your profile. I am emphasizing because you definitely start working on your SOP and LOR as early as possible. The admission is on first come first serve basis. So if you start applying to universities as early as October, then you will have a great chance to securing an admission as early as November or December. The more early you apply, the better chances you have of getting an early admit.Now since you have not mentioned about your profile, I would also tell you about the worst case scenario, i.e. you have nothing from the things I mentioned above(suppose, I hope not), then my friend you definitely need to retake the GRE.SO HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR SCORE.Since you are continuously, scoring 165 in Quants, then you need to just try and stretch your score by 4–5 marks, which is quite easy(i guess). It can only achieved by solving difficult problems from the Manhattan 5LB or you can always refer net. If you feel like you are lagging behind in a single topic like for eg, Geometry, then practice is the only option. If you are stuck in high level problems of any topics(in general) then you need to solve advance problems and also you need to improve your timing for simple problems. Now looking at your quant score of 165(i guess), you are easily able to solve simple, moderate and a few advanced problems. Now you just need to improve your speed in simple and moderate problems, so that you can shift you attention to the advanced problems. For example, if you are able to solve 1 question in 90sec, then you should bring it down to 75–80 sec for each problem. The extra 10–15 sec/problem would definitely help you get more problems in advanced problems. More time means more chances of getting a advanced problem correct. PLEASE DON’T DROP YOUR EFFICIENCY OF CURRENT QUESTIONS WHICH YOU ARE GETTING CORRECT. You need to improve in time and not drop your efficiency.NOW GETTING TO THE VERBAL PART. THIS PART IS DIFFICULT FOR THE MOST OF THE PEOPLE(including me).You need to strategize in order to score good. First if you get long passage don’t get stuck on them. In my opinion, you can first complete all the fill in the blanks. But, to fill in the blanks correctly, you need to have good command over your words. They need to memorized perfectly. You need to practice them regularly without any mistake and you should know where and when to use a word in the sentence. For that only practice and good knowledge of vocab is necessary. If you have not learnt words perfectly, then I m sorry to say, you Cannot crack the questions. Now coming to passages, start with the smaller ones, then the medium ones and lastly the long ones. This would help, since there is generally only 1 long passages with say 3–4 questions, you can get atleast 1 question correct. But from the remaining 16–17 questions you will have to score at least 12–14 to get a good score out of 20. Don’t waste your unnecessary time on long passages. So according to my calculations(u get 13 correct in both the sections of verbal), U can get a score of 156 in verbal and 169–170 in quant which would help you to get to score of 325.GRE HAS A SIMPLE RULE:PRACTICE MORE, AND CARRY YOUR LUCK DURING THE EXAM.(Luck is important, if you hate verbal and unfortunately u get a verbal in experimental, then it would be bad, because no one wants to see the verbal section thrice in those 4 hr marathon race.)Hope I have satisfied you to a certain extent.IF YOU MENTION YOUR PROFILE IN DETAIL, I WOULD DEFINITELY LOVE TO HELP YOU(whether you should retake the GRE and any other doubts).MY SUGGESTION: IF YOU HAVE GOOD PROFILE, THEN BETTER START WITH YOUR SOP,TRANSCRIPTS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS.BEST OF LUCK.","Majority of students spend between two and three months preparing for the GRE. Given we all struggle to sustain our attention and concentration for more than this long, such a duration makes perfect sense. After all, life’s inevitable “bumps” and distractions are far more likely to derail you during a six months studying for the GRE that you are better off giving it your all over a period of 2 to 3 months. Here is the perfect plan for those who can commit both the time and the cognitive resources necessary for a few months.A study plan of Catking will give structure to your preparation and will ensure that you are preparing the right way.MONTH 1: Target QuantGRE tests you on high school Maths only. You will not be tested on advanced topics such as calculus.• The GRE Maths maybe a little more intimidating for you if you didn’t have Maths in high school. Though the engineering students may not find Maths tested on the GRE to be very challenging, but they will see that they would have forgotten quite a few concepts and you may know how to solve a question but you may not know how best to solve a question.Go through the GRE Study material provided by CATKingStart going through the Maths concepts from the Official Guide and simultaneously start with the Quant concepts and formulae document in our lesson module section to get familiar with what you’d be up against.• Go through the topics one by one and do a sufficient number of questions from each topic so that you understand not only the concepts but their application too.• Start taking maths tests from our online test and do a thorough analysis of the questions.•Once you’ve identified the weak area, patch up those areas by going through the topic again and spending sometime on it. By the end of one month, you should be prepared enough for Maths and you should be ready to move on to the next challenge that is verbal.MONTH 2: Focus on VerbalStart with a topics provided in lesson modules, learn the strategies and then practice 10-15 questions from that topic per day. Make sure that you spend a good amount of time in analyzing the questions.•If you would have been reading editorials daily as suggested in month 1, by the second month, your comprehension skills would have improved quite a lot and you should be able to read complex passages. As you prepare for Verbal in the second month, remember that you do not stop studying Maths altogether. A good idea is to do 5 Maths questions everyday so that you feel that you are in touch with maths.•For Sentence Equivalence and Text Completion, you’ll have to primarily do Vocabulary, so in the first week, learn root words. This will make learning words a much more logical process and will give you a good foundation to learn words. Check out Verbal ability videos on Youtube which would also help you to prepare for GRE• Book your GRE date in the second week.• In the second week, practice Text Completion and Sentence Equivalence questions. If you’d have gone as per the suggested plan, you shouldn’t face much difficulty in doing these questions. Do not freak out learning very difficult words.• Start with the Reading comprehension part in the third week of this month. Go through the Types of questions tested on. Learn the strategies for tackling each type of question. For example, the strategy for tackling an inference question is absolutely different from that used for tackling detail questions.MONTH 3: Practicing and ReviewingThis month should be spent in taking full length tests, reviewing them and addressing your test taking weaknesses.•Take two full length tests provided by CATking. Take these practice tests preferably at the same time of the day for which you have booked your slot for. This will help your body get used to the timing.•In the first week, book your GRE date, if you haven’t already done so. In some testing centres, the GRE dates may not be easily available all the more so during the peak test taking season so it’s best to book it in the second month itself.•In the third week, take two more full length tests. Save one for the last week.•In the last week, take only one exam. Make sure that you take this exam at least 3 days before the exam.•Sleep well during the last few days. Do not study anything new in the last few days; rather focus on revising whatever you have done so far. Relax completely on the last day before the exam.•Take the GRE and blow it away!","As far as your your efforts are concerned, these are commendable that you want to chase the score and aspiring to get it more. At this juncture you are suggested to do some change in the preparation strategy. Here are some of the common mistake to avoid while preparing for GRE and during the test -Don’t scrimp on study materials - Just go though an ideal material such as - books, notes etc. Never read the books in jiffy. Give more attention and concentration to the what are you studying. Purchase some ideal books for the well structured preparation.Take GRE Practice Tests every weekend - Every often just appear for the sample practice test. Many people save practice tests for last 10 days before exam. I do not recommend this strategy, instead I advise you to do practice tests every weekend since it helps you to identify your weak areas, so you can concentrate more on them and subsequently find out the remedy.Do not underestimate quantitative section of New GRE - GMAT - math is not tough but challenging, so don't take it for granted. Just go through NCERT books for the conceptual clarity and then to the ideal practice book for GMAT. Then only you could be able to it more properly. Please do not make a mistake of underestimating quantitative section. Many of us are of impression that getting through quants section is just a cake walk (even I was under the same impression). Remember GRE math isn’t hard but it’s tricky. Without enough practice and proper strategies it can turn out to be a major score bummer. Quants is the scoring part of GRE and ideally Indians are considered good at math so with enough practice it can boost up our score.Verbal section is not just about vocabulary it is more than that - you can’t crack verbal section of GRE just by learning words, however that doesn’t mean vocab is useless. You need vocabulary for Text completion and Sentence equivalence. As ETS states emphasis on vocab is reduced and I experienced this as a trainer. Please note that 50% of question in verbal were from RC’s where vocab doesn’t help you much. Even in sentence Equivalence and Text Completion, you have to focus on nuances in sentences and learn to work in context. Just to say, there are many who memorized 5000 word list and scored less than 145.No last minute preparation- Never keep the preparation pending for the last moment. Always be up to the mark. Be prepared for the test thoroughly.Best of luck..!!","The GRE is an intriguing test, mystifying to many. Often we find students getting complacent that it is easy to crack without much training and a popular misconception is that only the Verbal section could be a challenge to work towards. However, the reality is quite contrary. Along with Verbal, students, in spite of a strong potential fail to get close to a 170 in Quant, and often end up in the low 160’s. In verbal often students end up around 150’s with a resultant total of 310. But you can score high, and remember higher the score, the better the universities where you can apply and higher the chances of admit and even scholarships!Here are few Tips to increase GRE scores-Target your dream school, not your dream GRE score, and work backward.Consistent practice. Getting higher GRE score is not difficult; with proper coaching and consistent practice, high GRE score is possible.Know your concepts wellKeep a track on your speedHow to Crack the GRE QuantThe test is tricky and section adaptive. Students often fail to identify the traps and end up marking the wrong answer. Constant practice will train you to avoid such traps and think quickly. The main hurdle on the test is speed. If you know the concepts that you are tested on well, you can go through the major part of the test quickly with a minute per question. This gives you enough time to solve the tougher questions, especially the Data Interpretation questions which will typically take more than 2 minutes per question.Understand, what is judged is your analytical capability, and not just your mathematical knowledge.Here is one example to help you understand-Column A: Number of factors of 100Column B: Number of factors of 441.Is A > B; B > A; A=B or cannot be determined.The concept requires you to prime factorize i.e. 100 = 22 * 52 and 441 = 32*72. The number of factors of each thus is 3 * 3 = 9 factors (using rule of counting). Thus the two columns are equal. If you know this concept you can do the question quickly. There are many such concepts in each of the main topics namely, Numbers, Statistics, Geometry, Coordinate Geometry, Sets, Speed Time Distance, Work Rate time, Counting and Probability. Knowing these concepts ensures you are fast in the test. Remember to always practice in sets of 20 questions, and time yourself - 35 minutes for a set of 20 Questions for Quant and 30 minutes for a set of 20 Questions for Verbal.How to crack GRE VerbalIn the Verbal section, students tend to memorize words in isolation and that is a foolproof way of practicing for failure in the actual test of Sentence Completion and Sentence Equivalence. In the older version of GRE, students were tested on synonyms and antonym questions and at that time rote memorization used to be helpful. But in the new GRE, you need to have knowledge of words in the context of sentences. In most of the tough questions the words are not that difficult; however, the meaning of the sentence and the connections between the blanks is tough to comprehend. One needs to practice and develop the skill of drawing meaning of the sentences from the clue words and transition words and predicting answers of the blanks.When building your vocabulary, try to understand words rather than memorize. Also, make sentences of your own which will make the meaning of the word stick in your memory. For example, consider the word ‘anachronism’. An easy way to understand this word is to break it as ana + chron + ism. This allows you to see that the root is ‘chron’. We know that chronology means pertaining to time. Thus this word must be related to time. ‘Ana’ is a prefix which means ‘out of’. Thus anachronism must be something which is out of chronological time. Now to easily remember this word make a sentence – for example, ‘Sword is an anachronism in modern warfare’. Ice the cake by writing down a few synonyms of the words. If you learn in this way not only will you understand the usage of words but it will be very helpful in Sentence Equivalence where you need to find two words which have similar meanings.Lastly, let’s address the most challenging section, Reading Comprehension. There are many strategies to handle RCs and you need to use the strategy that works for you. For most, the strategy which works best is to scan quickly the first time, understand the main idea of the passage and each paragraph, rather than the details. You can then go to the questions and start reading the specific details of the passage pertaining to each question.Last but not least, the most important thing to remember in order to increase your GRE score is to write a lot of genuine tests and analyze your mistakes carefully. Try and find out what kinds of mistakes are recurring. Are you getting caught in traps? Did you make any concept mistakes? Did you make reading and understanding errors? This analysis is the key to high scores.A little tip on improving AWA score.Remember, if you fail to prepare, you are preparing to fail!Good Luck…"
GRE,How do I score 320 in GRE in 20 days?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-score-320-in-GRE-in-20-days,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE)",17,"Making time would be your biggest concern so you will have to make time everyday or squeeze it into your busy schedule.

The quants is the scoring section and you should ideally be looking to get 170/170 in this section.

Being thorough with the high frequency words can actually help you a lot.

There are loads of practice questions and tests that are available along with videos which will definitely help you remember the words and their in-context meaning. Several shortcuts, tips and mnemonics are also a part of the videos. When you connect things with pictures, you remember them better which is exactly what the videos do.

Stop learning and don’t learn anything new since it is more likely that you will get confused because of it. Brush up on the concepts and KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK!A few of the following tips may come in handy:The GRE is a timed test: If we had all the time we need, then every one of us would get the perfect score on the GRE. But the GRE is a timed test, so it is important to not only be accurate but also quick when it comes to answering the questions. So when preparing for the GRE, time yourself. You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 mins both in the Verbal and the Quants section. Attempt a lot of mock tests it will help you a lot.Be aware of the wrong answers:The wrong answers generally tend to fall under certain categories which will help you eliminate the wrong choices when it comes to the GRE verbal reasoning section or reading comprehensions.The choices are most probably wrong if they:Assume too muchAre beyond the scope of the passageAre too extremeAre true but involve outside knowledgeAre too specific/too broadSave the worst for the last:They usually say save the best for the last but it doesn’t hold good when it comes to the competitive exams like GRE. You will end up wasting time if you attempt the unfamiliar questions. If you find a question complex, it is better to leave it for the time being and improve your score by answering the questions related to the easier and familiar questions.Utilize the scratch pad:Take short notes while reading the comprehension passage in the space allotted. Eliminate the unnecessary details and words which are just present to throw you off.The following are a few tips that might come in handy when it comes to the reading comprehension but they might also be applied to any question in the verbal section.DUMB them down:Questions on reading comprehension passages have the most gray area when compared to any other type of question in the GRE.Avoid skimming through the questions without understanding what is specifically being asked. If you find a question or choice confusing rephrase the question in your one words.Be on the look out for concessions:In many cases, the author may have a strong voice towards a certain topic or aspect in the passages. The author might have a strong opinion towards certain aspects in a passage and argue for it throughout the passage but then the author might suddenly stop doing so and make subtle or drastic concessions to the opposing side which will weaken the arguments that were previously made in the reading comprehension passage. Make sure that you aren’t thrown by such concessions.Make use of the context:If the question asked is related to a specific line in the reading comprehension passage, it won’t help if you just go back and read the sentence. The thumb rule is to read at least one sentence before and after the aforementioned line.Zero in on the idea behind the longer passages:Majority of the reading comprehension passages that you will come across while taking the GRE will be short but on the off chance that you encounter one or two longer ones, it is advisable to focus more on the first and last paragraphs of the passage and find the big picture of the passage, since time is of the essence.Find the tone of the passage:The tone of the passage can be found using the choice of words or the turn of phrases used by the author. Even if the tone appears to be neutral, assume that it is complex and look for the tone. You can arrive at the tone by observing the diction or by asking the following questions:Does the author feel positively or negatively about a certain topic?What aspect of the topic does the author criticize?What concerns does the author raise through the passage?Which adverbs and adjectives does the author use to voice his opinion?Last but not the leastWatch your diet: An important factor which most students ignore to their detriment is their health and diet. This is very important both during your preparation and while taking the test. Ensure that you stick to a nutritious diet since you will need a lot of energy during your preparation. It is a good thing to avoid eating outside especially junk food, during your preparatory phase. Also, refrain from drinking, partying and taking recreational drugs a week or two before the Test day.P.S.

However, I started with a good foundation. With my SAT history and intense workload at college, I scored 320+ on my first mock test after I reviewed the vocabulary — in other words, it took me nothing but memorizing a few words to get myself at around 320.People at different levels or from different backgrounds require different strategies and time investment to reach that 320 goal. Regardless, the 20 days I spent got me 15+ points further. I can’t tell you how to reach 320 without knowing much about your background and needs, but I can tell you how to utilize a shorter time period to make some good progress:Focus.

When the time is limited, you need to focus on those areas to make the most progress. Take a few mock tests and find those spots, and work on them relentlessly.Make mistakes. Don’t worry about them at all. It is a good thing to find yourself making mistakes when you’re practicing than you do on the real test. When you practice, you want to expose all the possible ways you make mistakes, and then find ways to avoid them. The reality is, aside from the vocabulary, GRE hardly covers anything that esoteric. In many cases, it’s the silly mistakes you make that really keeps you from getting your dream score. Learning how to avoid those mistakes can allow you to improve quickly. You just need to identify them first, by making them.Analyze. Don’t just practice questions after questions. Think about them. Find patterns, find how you get them wrong, and find quicker ways to solve these questions. At the end of the day, it’s not the quantity of questions that you practiced on that matters the most, it’s how you treat them. Don’t just focus on getting the questions right, focus on how to get better.Consolidate. After you’ve practiced, made mistakes, and analyzed them, now it’s time to consolidate your takeaways. Make yourself a list of actions you can take during the actual test to help yourself perform better. This could include double checking your zeros, or being more alarmed of particular words, or things you tend to forget or overlook. Take a good look at them before you take the test.Many of my friends have asked me how I got the score I have. Frankly this is it.

Take a good look at them before you take the test.Many of my friends have asked me how I got the score I have. Frankly this is it. Now I’m building Gregory to help people do these things automatically. I’d be happy to hear any thoughts/feedback on it.Footnotes[1] What Is The 80/20 Rule And Why It Will Change Your Life","First nothing is impossible for anyone to achieve. 21 days is a very short period of time and I don’t want to discourage you. But I do have some tips for a preparation.Vocabulary Building for Verbal Section - Take two alphabets each day and start memorizing at least 30 words per alphabet. Try grouping the synonyms together and writing down the antonyms. This will help you learning more words easily. Download the Magoosh Vocabulary flash cards app on your phone and start preparing right away.Barron’s 3000 word list is available online. You should read it and try acing as many words as possible.Quantitative - Make a time table with the detailed versions of every section in mathematics. You should take up one topic every day and start practicing different level difficulty questions. Try to remember the tricks, the area formulas, the shortcuts. Make a copy where you could note the tricks and the formulas which you glance every day before starting a new topic. Make ALERT AREAS AS THOSE YOU ARE TAKING MOST OF THE TIME SOLVING.Each day read essays on different GRE topics. Try framing your own essays and also practice the “ISSUE” Topic that comes for writing. It will be a refreshing break from your daily maths practice and will also help you think pragmatically in the direction of the topic.It is important to familiarize yourself with 3 hours while taking the GRE exam. Register for an online test series by Manhattan Prep or Princeton review. You should at least take 6 online tests before appearing for the GRE if your are aiming a score above 320. Look into your problem areas. Manage time and you will be well acquainted with what you will be facing on the real day of the examination. I feel with systematic approach and a lot of practice you can ACE the GRE.","20 Days - it is a really small amount for preparation, but you can manage it.

It should include the “W” questions: Who? What? Where? When? Which? and Why?M - Measurable: A proper schedule should be created and maintained. Establish a concrete number - how many number of words would you like to master? How many weeks would you like to spend for each GRE section? How will I determine if I have accomplished it?A - Achievable: A schedule with defined time and activity is something needed for preparation. Make sure that the words you wanted to master and the time you want to prepare would be achievable. Also, practice as many mock test as possible to avoid cram during exam.R - Realistic: Provide each list of words a realistic time to finish.

GRE,"Which is the best GRE Online Program: Magoosh, GRE Edge, Crack Verbal, Chalkstreet or Galvanize test prep?",https://www.quora.com//Which-is-the-best-GRE-Online-Program-Magoosh-GRE-Edge-Crack-Verbal-Chalkstreet-or-Galvanize-test-prep,"Crack Verbal, Galvanize Test Prep, Gre Edge, ChalkStreet, Magoosh, GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions",73,"Since I didn’t enroll with Magoosh or Crack Verbal or Chalkstreet or Galvanize, I can’t speak for them although I did use the Magoosh vocab app which was good and precise. But I can speak for GREedge as I was enrolled in one of their programs. The experience was definitely good as I recently took the GRE and scored 323 and 4 in AWA.When you enroll with GREedge, they give you two SFAs (Student Facilitator and Analysts) who work with you throughout the process. They constantly remind you of your goals for the week, things you have pending and other stuff. They give you an idea about what things to read to improve your comprehensive reading skills (which is pivotal in an exam like GRE) with respect to the GRE. In a nutshell, they are really helpful pushing you to be consistent.Their “Learning Tracker” is a good place where various tools are there for your disposal, like the “Ask a doubt” feature or different wordlists or the dictionary app which focuses on GRE words. Everything is neatly organised and the best part is you can work on it from anywhere anytime. They provide you a huge amount of material both in quant and in verbal and it is up to you to use it. Also, they tell you to set a target score in quant and in verbal and they provide you statistical data showing where you stand among the different students who have achieved the target score set by you. So, it gives you a fair idea regarding how much more effort you need to put subject wise and topic wise. Also, they frequently conduct seminars where different people talk about different techniques which can be implemented in different sections of the exam or about their experiences regarding GRE and MS in general. So, that helps too.The most striking feature of GREedge is their “Wordbot” app where they provide you a set of words with pictures describing their meanings. Now, you may not remember the meaning of a certain word, like “appalled” for instance, but you’ll certainly remember the appalled expression of Brad Pitt which is shown in the picture describing the word. My point is you can retain pictures more easily than words. And it helps, at least in my case it did. And not a single word in my GRE was outside the set of words in Wordbot.Overall, it was a rewarding experience for me. And lastly, it is always up to you to take maximum use of the resources of any program. I understand it becomes hard especially if you are working on a job, but it helped me. And, as someone has already said, it ultimately boils down to the amount of effort you make.So, all the best!","I Galvanize is a good option for GRE preparation. ( My GRE Score: 306/340)In the first place, there was no specific cause for choosing Galvanize and I opted for it reading some of the reviews in the internet which told mentioned provide a pretty good course material designed to help you achieve your target score.After completing my journey with Galvanize I am putting forward my personal opinion for it as your GRE Guide.

GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5.

GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How can I score good marks in GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-score-good-marks-in-GRE-1,"GRE Preparation, Academic Test Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Exam and Test Preparation, Studying, Education, Exams and Tests",72,"First of all, I’m guessing by a high score you mean 330 - 340. Do not at all get afraid by all the propaganda that it is something extremely tough to achieve. It is not.I am not someone extraordinary. I failed countless, meaningless exams in my life. I have never been a topper or even close to that. So trust me, when I say, it is an extremely achievable target.Like any successful recipe, this also begins with some ingredients:Magoosh GRE Material (Verbal and Quants)Manhattan 5 lb. bookManhattan Mock Test Series (A set of 6 mock tests)Magoosh Flashcards (Available for free)Official ETS MaterialConfidence that you can do itGive yourself 2 - 3 months for preparation. Prepare a timeline.First things first, complete the Magoosh GRE Material videos. Both Verbal and Quants. They will take you quite some time. But they will be more than helpful in jogging old memories and clearing out the rust on those 10th standard mathematics that are already there but have been dormant being unused.Understand more importantly the process they are following to solve. Mathematics will follow straightforward logic, whereas Verbal might seem a little illogical at first, but really it is not. For Verbal it is VERY important to know the EXACT meaning of the words (Where constant practice from Magoosh Flashcards will help you) and also the structure and overall meaning of the sentence provided. Once you start getting the hang of it, you will start to understand the meaning and tone of the sentence, both in Reading Comprehension passages and Text Completions.Next, you MUST complete the ETS Official Guides, all 3 of them. There will be 2 mock tests provided in the book. Make sure you complete them and try to bring a score of +/- 2 from your target score. For example, for me the target score was 330, so I targeted for 328 - 332 in the ETS mocks.Next, the Manhattan 5 lb. book will be immensely helpful. Practice as much as you can each day. Doing BOTH Quants and Verbal. Complete the book by doing each and every problem and going through the answers that you did wrong or had confusion in. Also, make timelines (I did every alternate day) and give the 6 mocks one by one from Manhattan during this period. These mocks are a lot harder than actual GRE, so if you are scoring 318 - 322, expect a high score in GRE.Last but not the least, read, understand and memorize the words from Magoosh Flashcards. They will come extremely handy when you’re doing RC or TC.In the end, believe in yourself. Practice a lot and be confident of your ability. Most importantly, drink a lot of fluids! (Not just before the exam though - your washroom time is counted as the exam time except for breaks)Have a blast with the exam!

Preparation is a key ingredient in order to fulfill your dream of being admitted in USA Colleges/universities.Here is a schedule guide in Mastering Words for you:If I may suggest, identifying the SMART objective of your GRE preparation would be pretty useful. (You can actually create your own timeline for this)S - Specific: Your end-goal should be stated, for example: Be confident when taking the GRE exam because I have prepared very well, studied every topic and even had practice tests to enhance more my skills. It should include the “W” questions: Who? What? Where? When? Which? and Why?M - Measurable: A proper schedule should be created and maintained. Establish a concrete number - how many number of words would you like to master? How many weeks would you like to spend for each GRE section? How will I determine if I have accomplished it?A - Achievable: A schedule with defined time and activity is something needed for preparation. Make sure that the words you wanted to master and the time you want to prepare would be achievable. Also, practice as many mock test as possible to avoid cram during exam.R - Realistic: Provide each list of words a realistic time to finish. Let’s say a list of 10 words can be mastered in 3 days or maybe a week. That includes reviewing it through games/the help of vocab app. I suggest you use Preped Vocab - for free.

GRE has two parts - Verbal and Quantitative. Most people find DI - part of quant- to be a little tough. It requires a lot of practice to get used to. For the Verbal part, a lot depends on how habituated you are to reading. If you've been reading newspaper articles and books since you were young, a little more effort would see you through. For others, instead of trying to memorise words, try to understand the word root method.That's why I emphasize a lot on Norman Lewis - Word Power Made Easy because it helps you build this skill.rahul catking norman lewisWhen trying to understand the meaning of a new word, follow up with its synonyms as well. This helps you grow your vocabulary really fast. Synonyms and antonyms are quite useful in the actual exam. The quant asked in the exam has really basic concepts. You should learn to read between the lines and try to grasp the generic form of it. Go back to your 10th grade books. They contain quite a lot of useful information. Keep giving mocks on a regular basis to acclimatise yourself to the exam giving environment. 4-5 days before the final exam, give PowerPrep I. This would be quite close to the real GRE. Devise a strategy for the final exam. You should decide when to take a break if need be. On exam day, be prepared with all your documents needed for the exam.

GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"

First of all, the course content is pretty well structured to help you master the requirements of GRE. The variety, the gradual increase in the of the difficulty level, and finally exceeding the level of the exam, really helps you get accustomed and cope up with the actual style of the exam. This has been inferred after completing my exam with the score as mentioned above.Well, along with Galvanize, I also used to practice Manhattan 5 lb book (a must practice book I must say: it contains all the topics required in GRE) and look up to Magoosh Free GRE Flashcards app for vocab. Although, Galvanize does have their own pool of words, but somehow I liked Magoosh app which may be due to the reason that I had already started learning from it before I took Galvanize.According to me, I feel that the best strategy for cracking GRE would be to practice Manhattan 5 lb book and give the corresponding section tests from Galvanize which would help you to highlight your progress considering the time limit factor.Finally, summarizing the pros and cons of Galvanize:-PROS:Structured Material: All the sections (Verbal and Quant) are nicely divided that help you brush through and be thorough with the different topics.Reasonable Pricing.There are webinars covering each topics in detail, from the basics of each chapter of quant to the details of tricks and tips for verbal section. They are also recorded so that you can access them afterwards too.The portal, from the Diagnostic Test all the way through the section tests and practice sessions up to the Mock Tests, continuously estimates your score for each Section and this really motivated me to work on the parts that I was weak in.After each exam/sectional practice parts you have the detailed analysis of your performance that indicates the time taken by you in solving a problem and the average time taken by others to solve the same problem. Also, for each problem, the percentage of students who got it correct is also mentioned which highlight where you stand.Numerous tests from various topics with and without time limit that helps in mastering the various topics in bits and pieces.Detailed answers for each of the problems in both verbal and quant that highlight the loopholes in your approach to the problem.SPECIAL MENTION: Friendly team that keeps up your spirit and also, GALVANIZE HAS EXTENDED MY ACCESS TO THEIR PORTAL FOR AN EXTRA MONTH WITHOUT ANY CHARGE! That really helped me a lot.CONS:For the wordlist, sentences should be provided along with the words so as to get the meaning in a more contextual way.Galvanize should build a word pool of their own rather than directing to an external website for the vocab prep.Well, having said these, I thank the team for their support and would strongly recommend Galvanize for GRE. Follow the course sincerely besides practicing the Manhattan Book and you should achieve your target score!Good luck for all those who look forward to take up this exam."
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
GRE,How do I get 330 in the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-get-330-in-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Exam Strategies",32,"GRE is not a test of your intelligence. It's more about how well you are able to hack the exam pattern and temperament.To go from 320 or 325 to 330/330+ makes all the difference and every point needs to be earned.Verbal: Assuming most people appearing for GRE from India are engineers or atleast from STEM background, Verbal gives nightmares to everyone. Blame it on our schools who taught us to mug up answers in English.Vocab: Don't be lazy about Vocab! It pays rich dividends. Good vocab prep means Sentence Equivalence and Text Completions part done so 8/20 questions taken care of. It helps tremendously in improving AWA quality, understanding RCs and TOEFL writing too. Start slowly and build up from there. Start with 333 High frequency word list, then move on to 800 word list, then 2000 and so on. 10 days prior to GRE focus on 800 word list. It helps the most. (If you are preparing for GRE under severe time constraints, Barron’s800 word list is your saviour). 90% of words on my GRE were from list and I was able to solve all questions by process of elimination because I knew all options or all but one in worst case scenario. There are several apps& websites available like : Magoosh Flashcards, Quizlet, Memrise etc. They have different formats. Pick what suits you the best. My personal favourite was Memrise because reviewing words already learnt is as important if not more as compared to learning new words. Set short targets such learning 20 new words.Reading Comprehensions: pace yourself well while reading. First reading should be mostly skimming through the text. If you don't understand something don't fret. You don't need to understand the whole passage to crack it. Don't trust instincts/gut feeling/memory either. Read every option and verify with relevant parts of passage. (Paraphrasing may help if you are really quick at reading). GRE tries to trick you by twisting/omitting/adding usually a word in the options which isn't in the passage. Thumbrule: eliminate any negative/out of context/ controversial options. More the practice and mock tests, better will be your RCs part.Quant:Manhattan 5 pound is a great book to start off and tackle questions of varying difficulty. Note: Don't skip Advance Quant part. Due to adaptive nature of tests you may get difficult questions in 2nd quant so it's a good idea to get used to it.How to avoid silly mistakes? By accepting them. Whenever I made a mistake in a mock test, instead of classifying under the broad banner of silly mistakes, I would write it down. Example “I calculated % instead of %change” etc.Utilise all 35 mins. Recheck every answer, using substitution or something. It really helps to eliminate silly mistakes.AWA: Usually we just have to clear a cut off for AWA.Read sample essays initially.Practice writing under timed conditions so you know how to manage those 30 mins.Leave 4–5 mins at end for proofreading twice. We tend to ignore spelling mistakes during first reading.General:Practice a lot of mocks with timed conditions so you are accustomed to various exam formats (number and sequence of verbal and quant sections)Keep a track of progress and keep reviewing mistakes.GRE is a test of temperament. Practice sitting in a chair in front of a computer and keeping your brain in full concentration mode for 4 hours at a stretch!Cheers! All the best!","The BasicsFirst off, let me assume you haven't completed an Engineering degree in a First-World Anglophone country, because a lot of my advice probably wouldn't apply to you then. I also don't think you'd have any problems scoring 330 as easy as pie because of the way you've been educated, so this post won't apply to you then. If you haven't however, a score of 330+ on the GRE signifies one of two things: You're either exceptionally well-rounded in both the Verbal and the Quantitative aspects of your education, meaning you won't lose more than 10 points aggregate in all your sections combined. There's a few people I know who're this way despite their Third-World upbringing. Hats off to them.Or, as I was, you're talented enough to score 170/170 on only one of your sections, and you've prepared well enough and done what's required on test-day not to lose more than 10 points on your other section. This was me. I knew I would get 169-170 on my Quants all along, it was all about damage limitation on GRE Verbal (which I wasn't very good at) and making sure I didn't squander more than ten points on test day. I succeeded, but not without some serious doubts along the way.So the objective is clear. You've got to avoid losing more than 10 points on test-day, Verbal and Quants combined. Let me talk about how I managed to accomplish that feat and how you can do the same.GRE VerbalFor me, Verbal was far and away the most difficult of all three GRE Sections, simply because of the limitations in my vocabulary and the types of questions that I encountered when I practiced for the GRE. If you're in the same boat, you'll fully understand how preparing for GRE Verbal can sometimes fill you with doubt and depression, because you've simply got no idea about what the right answer choice could be. The way I see it, the most crucial aspect to mastering GRE Verbal is not how much time you spend preparing. It hasn't even got much to do with how many words you know.The most crucial skill on GRE Verbal is Context.What does that mean? Basically, you need to know how the different words in English you're already familiar with can be used in differing contexts to provide alternate meanings. This is how you should inculcate context into your GRE Preparation:First things first. Buy a complete prep book for GRE Verbal. I chose Kaplan GRE Premier, but only because that was the book somebody else recommended to me. Barron's and ETS are more than good enough as well.Go through all the question types, tips and practice questions provided in at least one of these books. Doing so will ingrain the format of the question paper and the probable words you're likely to come across on the day of the test itself. If you make a mistake in answering a question, write that down in a separate booklet, understand why you made that mistake (unknown word, wrong context etc.) and make sure it doesn't happen again.I would also recommend going through all the resources available on the Magoosh website (https://gre.magoosh.com/) as well as the apps they've got for GRE Verbal, available for smartphones. They really helped brush up my vocabulary.I've also covered GRE Verbal Preparation in more detail here:What can I do to improve my verbal score in the GRE from 153 to 160+?GRE QuantsI didn't need to spend a lot of time preparing for the Quantitative Section of the GRE, partly because it was just 10th Grade Math, and partly because I knew I had more pressing issues to deal with a.k.a Verbal. But if you feel like you need to do better in Quant, there's really no substitute for practice. The books that I've mentioned previously have all got chapters devoted to GRE Quants as well, so getting questions to practice with shouldn't be a problem. Work on the mathematical concepts that you'll need for the test, improve your time management skills, and you'll be fine.Analytical WritingAgain, AWA wasn't especially relevant to my GRE Preparation since I'm going to be applying for an MS in an Engineering discipline, so anything above 4.0/6.0 was fine by me. There are two kinds of essays you'll have to write on test-day, 30 minutes each, with slightly different writing styles. The best way to improve your essay writing skills is to read the sample essays that're given in your prep books, and practice using similar words when you write your own pieces. This goes without saying, but please make sure your essays are devoid of any grammatical/spelling mistakes, as those kinds of errors tend to be looked upon very poorly. Lastly, here's an here's an extensive guide written by the lads over at CrunchPrep on scoring 330+ on your GRE.Hope this helps :)","Here’s how I scored 330+ with a 3 week preparation plan!It is important to understand that the GRE is very different as compared to the other exams we are used to giving, talking from an Indian’s perspective. Blind hard work will not serve any purpose and sometimes will be counterproductive.ETS (the company that conducts the GRE) wants to convince you that your score is a measure of how good you are at ‘critical thinking’, but in reality it is only a measure of how good you are at giving the GRE. So, fortunately for us, the more you practise in the correct way, the better you become at giving the GRE.The Correct Way (in my experience) :Quality > Quantity. Always. Please do not spend 10+ hours a day mechanically solving problems and forgetting about them as you move forward. This will cause you to plateau at a certain skill level. The key is small incremental improvements.For me, the ideal way was a simple 3 step process :1.	Solve problems in small sets, around 20(+5 || -5) questions per set.2.	Check your answers. See the solutions, understand them thoroughly.3.	After checking all, recap the questions you got wrong, why, and what you learnt from them. This is extremely important.Let’s jump into the schedule now, shall we?Pre-prep phase (1 week) :Okay, I lied, it’s not really 3 weeks, but this pre-prep phase won’t take more than two hours of your time per day, and what’s more, you can easily do this while you eat or just before sleeping.What is to be done? Words, Words and more Words.Spend this week learning the words from the following apps :1.	Barron’s 11002.	Magoosh Flash Cards (around 1000 words)3.	Manhattan Essential Words (around 500 words)Vocabulary is essential to understanding the Reading Comprehensions as well as the sentence completions, so please complete this before moving ahead!Week 1 :Congratulations! The boring part is done. This week, let’s do :1.	4 Practice Tests2.	Practise each type of question in isolation. For example, do 20 Text Completions in one set. This will help you to identify weaknesses to work on.3.	Brush up all the shortcuts and maths formulae that you encounter.(Online Magoosh article exists)Week 2 :This week, let’s move forward with :1.	6 Practice Tests.2.	Do mixed practice sets now (All types of problems together), to simulate the actual GRE scenario.3.	Strictly time your tests and practice sets. Keep 5 minutes per section as a buffer. Identify which type of questions you are slow at. Work on them.Week 3 :Buckle up, this is your final lap :1.	8 practice tests.2.	Start reading AWA essays online, as well as general structuring tips. A lot of video material is available online. Practise a few essays if necessary.3.	Revise the Vocabulary words and mathematical formulae.At the end of this schedule, you should be ready to face the GRE. So be confident, sleep well before the paper and ohh, don’t forget to carry a jacket. It’s freezing in there.Thanks for reading!

GRE,"Which is the best GRE Online Program: Magoosh, GRE Edge, Crack Verbal, Chalkstreet or Galvanize test prep?",https://www.quora.com//Which-is-the-best-GRE-Online-Program-Magoosh-GRE-Edge-Crack-Verbal-Chalkstreet-or-Galvanize-test-prep,"Crack Verbal, Galvanize Test Prep, Gre Edge, ChalkStreet, Magoosh, GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions",73,"Since I didn’t enroll with Magoosh or Crack Verbal or Chalkstreet or Galvanize, I can’t speak for them although I did use the Magoosh vocab app which was good and precise. But I can speak for GREedge as I was enrolled in one of their programs. The experience was definitely good as I recently took the GRE and scored 323 and 4 in AWA.When you enroll with GREedge, they give you two SFAs (Student Facilitator and Analysts) who work with you throughout the process. They constantly remind you of your goals for the week, things you have pending and other stuff. They give you an idea about what things to read to improve your comprehensive reading skills (which is pivotal in an exam like GRE) with respect to the GRE. In a nutshell, they are really helpful pushing you to be consistent.Their “Learning Tracker” is a good place where various tools are there for your disposal, like the “Ask a doubt” feature or different wordlists or the dictionary app which focuses on GRE words. Everything is neatly organised and the best part is you can work on it from anywhere anytime. They provide you a huge amount of material both in quant and in verbal and it is up to you to use it. Also, they tell you to set a target score in quant and in verbal and they provide you statistical data showing where you stand among the different students who have achieved the target score set by you. So, it gives you a fair idea regarding how much more effort you need to put subject wise and topic wise. Also, they frequently conduct seminars where different people talk about different techniques which can be implemented in different sections of the exam or about their experiences regarding GRE and MS in general. So, that helps too.The most striking feature of GREedge is their “Wordbot” app where they provide you a set of words with pictures describing their meanings. Now, you may not remember the meaning of a certain word, like “appalled” for instance, but you’ll certainly remember the appalled expression of Brad Pitt which is shown in the picture describing the word. My point is you can retain pictures more easily than words. And it helps, at least in my case it did. And not a single word in my GRE was outside the set of words in Wordbot.Overall, it was a rewarding experience for me. And lastly, it is always up to you to take maximum use of the resources of any program. I understand it becomes hard especially if you are working on a job, but it helped me. And, as someone has already said, it ultimately boils down to the amount of effort you make.So, all the best!","I Galvanize is a good option for GRE preparation. ( My GRE Score: 306/340)In the first place, there was no specific cause for choosing Galvanize and I opted for it reading some of the reviews in the internet which told mentioned provide a pretty good course material designed to help you achieve your target score.After completing my journey with Galvanize I am putting forward my personal opinion for it as your GRE Guide.

Although, Galvanize does have their own pool of words, but somehow I liked Magoosh app which may be due to the reason that I had already started learning from it before I took Galvanize.According to me, I feel that the best strategy for cracking GRE would be to practice Manhattan 5 lb book and give the corresponding section tests from Galvanize which would help you to highlight your progress considering the time limit factor.Finally, summarizing the pros and cons of Galvanize:-PROS:Structured Material: All the sections (Verbal and Quant) are nicely divided that help you brush through and be thorough with the different topics.Reasonable Pricing.There are webinars covering each topics in detail, from the basics of each chapter of quant to the details of tricks and tips for verbal section.

GRE,How do I prepare for the GRE in 2 months? Can anyone suggest books?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-prepare-for-the-GRE-in-2-months-Can-anyone-suggest-books,"GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), How-to Question",27,"Yes absolutely. I scored a 334 with 2 months of prep. Link to books and free resources below.Create a plan that works for you based on your schedule, however here are some crucial elements of your Prep that you must follow:1. Practice TestsUse the paid Manhattan Prep test series for your mock test practice. There are 6 tests available here. Along with this, you'll find 1 free Kaplan test, 2 tests in the ETS Official guide, and 2 free Powerprep II Tests that you can download from the ETS website. Don't do more than 1 mock a week. And save the Powerpreps for the end.The GRE is a long long exam, and even after doing many mocks, the final test day can be pretty draining. That is why not taking any shortcuts on the mocks, is extremely important. It is also important to ensure that you do the tests around the time that you will be giving the GRE, so that your mind and body are ready to be alert - 8am, 10am, or whatever slot you will be booking.Begin your preparation with Manhattan's first mock to know where you stand and what you need to work on - weaknesses. That's free.After that - using the same email id with which you make your Manhattan a/c, go on Amazon and buy the Manhattan Sentence Equivalence book - Kindle version. Then email your amazon receipt to Manhattan from that same email id. They will activate your mock tests - 6, valid for 6 months. (Google this process once to make sure its still valid, shouldn't have changed since I just did it 1.5 months back). This way you can get the tests for less than 500 rupees.2. VocabularyVocabulary needs practice from the start, everyday. For that the Magoosh app is good, but a better way to do it is - download the 'Quizlet' app on your phone and search for Rajeshwar1247 or ""Magoosh GRE Flashcards"". This kind individual has uploaded everything from the Magoosh Vocab book onto this app. You can learn and quiz yourself through this, so its a much faster method. Start doing this asap.Don’t bother learning too many words, these 1000 words should be enough. The difficulty on the actual test is not that words are unfamiliar, but that the sentences are complex.So instead of buying more vocabulary books and wasting money, practice all the Sentence Equivalence and Text Completion questions in the Manhattan 5lb book, note down each word you do not know, and make a separate list of those. Also go through the answers to catch your mistakes.3. Analytical WritingAll the issue/argument topics are up on the ETS website, but going through them all does not help. First, Any guide (Official ETS Verbal guide, Manhattan RC guide) will provide you with an explanation of the general patterns of each type of essay. It is important to understand this and then read a few sample essays that score high (again found in guides).The writing sections are not testing knowledge but instead structure and critical thinking ability. If you have a flair for writing, this should not be too challenging. However, if not, then take up a few topics and write your own essays, and then compare them with sample essays provided in the verbal or Manhattan guide. You will notice that you have missed out on a few arguments, and that will slowly help you think more critically, and write better essays.4. Verbal and Quant PracticeStep 1 is to do the ETS General Test guide cover to cover, to understand the test and the Verbal and Quant sections. Do all the questions in the book and ensure you are clear about every concept in Quant.Then you begin practice. Here the Manhattan 5lb. book is the best resource, with over 2000 questions. Solve questions in small sets of 20–25 and then go through the answers, understand your mistakes and note your weak areas. Use the insights from this practice and your mock tests to understand topics that you need to be more thorough in.Then pick up the Manhattan book that is specific to your area of weakness and go deeper into that particular topic to completely clarify the concept for yourself. I did this with inequalities, but did not need to for most other topics. Don’t do this unless you feel it is required.For VERBAL in particular, please also do the Official ETS Verbal Guide a few days before your actual GRE exam, since it is important to get accustomed to ETS’ way of testing.If you create a plan covering 25–40 Vocabulary words a day, 40 practice questions and 2 essays and 1 mock practice test a week, you will be more than prepared for a 330+As a bonus, I did all this without spending a penny (except on the manhattan tests). This drive link has all of the resources I have mentioned abovehttps://drive.google.com/drive/f...You will find them easily with some searching.All the best for your test and hope this is useful!","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice tests from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). After this you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams (about 4 hrs.). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e. Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or, you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes. But do use the three aforementioned tests! All you have to do is create a user ID at each of the websites (Kaplan, Manhattan and Princeton). If you buy the Official ETS GRE guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also to analyze the stats for their future test papers. We will not know which section is the experimental one so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section. What we do know is that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is imperative that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Let’s tackle the Verbal section first. (As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes, there are numerous word lists available, but do not start with them first! The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the decks. Do it every day or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But, this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy (WPME)' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible. Chris's approach is brilliant and his enthusiasm is infectious). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands!Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But it’s of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read through the question/passage and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension section, you might come across huge comprehensions with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how they have approached the question. This is vital step for improving your attempts at RCs. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend buying the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section thoroughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests (paper-based) apart from the Powerprep software, which are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these questions will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). Sometimes, you tend to rush into solving the question without looking at the question completely. You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. In the later stages of practicing, start solving with a time limit for each question.  You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions.  For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is explained in the ETS Official GRE material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but, you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully observe what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too! (If you are an Asian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you’ll face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty badly here. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But, I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents. I do know that reading through numerous essays (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section' online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have at least 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day. So I’d recommend giving one of the paper-based tests from the Official ETS GRE material a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time, so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations for the correct answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test. Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now it’s your time to perform. Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel aren’t doing well, but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve a well-rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well. You have the other sections to make up for it. If you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position! Also please don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you’re concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or at least what you aimed for, remember GRE is not the end! I could not get the score I aimed for and initially I was disappointed. Soon I realized that it’s really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed, you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I scored 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know!) and breezed through them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you! Best of luck in cracking the GRE! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Also, I'd really like to know how your exam went, the difficulties/challenges you faced and how you overcame them. Everyone has a different perspective. I have merely written my approach above and I'd love to know your approach. Mentioning score isn't mandatory. You can simply comment on the post or send me a message about your experience with the GRE. Cheers!Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)__________________________________________________UPDATE: Henceforth I'll be giving only view access to the folder.

So, using it will not be effective preparation with two months to go. Don't waste your time on this.MagooshThere is pretty much no downside to getting the Magoosh Flashcards app since it is free and mostly has words that have a high likelihood of turning up on the test. I started drilling with this app a month before my GRE. Several times, the GRE uses secondary meanings of words and the app does a good job of illustrating these meanings with nice examples. For a free resource, Magoosh is incredibly good and I would recommend reading their GRE blog once in a while.A couple of days before the test, reset your Magoosh word app and just go through all the words again to ensure you know most. If you forget a few advanced ones, don't panic. The probability of them showing up on the test is probably low.General Vocab advice:Write down words that you find difficult. Maybe even make flashcards of your own. Attribute difficult words to settings you are familiar with - traits of your friends, characters from books and TV shows, etc. Use them in conversation (the jokes your friends make about your attempt at grandiloquence may actually help you remember a word's meaning better than any app), throw them into your writing and make mnemonics. Basically, whatever works to make them stick!Like the New Yorker on facebook and read articles about topics that interest you. Each time you see an unfamiliar word, try guessing its meaning based on context and then cross-check using ""define <word>"" on google.Manhattan books and Barron's 800:I personally used neither but Barron's 800 might be a good tool for building vocabulary. The general opinion amongst people about Manhattan prep seems to be positive. So, I guess you can use it for practice.Now, here is what's important. Just learning the words with apps and books will not be enough. You will need to know how they work in context, and for this, you will need to practice actual test-type questions.Get the ETS Official Guide and make sure you do every single question in the book. Also take the practice tests seriously, analyze your weaknesses and work on them systematically.Hope this helps.

GRE,"Which is the best GRE Online Program: Magoosh, GRE Edge, Crack Verbal, Chalkstreet or Galvanize test prep?",https://www.quora.com//Which-is-the-best-GRE-Online-Program-Magoosh-GRE-Edge-Crack-Verbal-Chalkstreet-or-Galvanize-test-prep,"Crack Verbal, Galvanize Test Prep, Gre Edge, ChalkStreet, Magoosh, GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions",73,"Since I didn’t enroll with Magoosh or Crack Verbal or Chalkstreet or Galvanize, I can’t speak for them although I did use the Magoosh vocab app which was good and precise. But I can speak for GREedge as I was enrolled in one of their programs. The experience was definitely good as I recently took the GRE and scored 323 and 4 in AWA.When you enroll with GREedge, they give you two SFAs (Student Facilitator and Analysts) who work with you throughout the process. They constantly remind you of your goals for the week, things you have pending and other stuff. They give you an idea about what things to read to improve your comprehensive reading skills (which is pivotal in an exam like GRE) with respect to the GRE. In a nutshell, they are really helpful pushing you to be consistent.Their “Learning Tracker” is a good place where various tools are there for your disposal, like the “Ask a doubt” feature or different wordlists or the dictionary app which focuses on GRE words. Everything is neatly organised and the best part is you can work on it from anywhere anytime. They provide you a huge amount of material both in quant and in verbal and it is up to you to use it. Also, they tell you to set a target score in quant and in verbal and they provide you statistical data showing where you stand among the different students who have achieved the target score set by you. So, it gives you a fair idea regarding how much more effort you need to put subject wise and topic wise. Also, they frequently conduct seminars where different people talk about different techniques which can be implemented in different sections of the exam or about their experiences regarding GRE and MS in general. So, that helps too.The most striking feature of GREedge is their “Wordbot” app where they provide you a set of words with pictures describing their meanings. Now, you may not remember the meaning of a certain word, like “appalled” for instance, but you’ll certainly remember the appalled expression of Brad Pitt which is shown in the picture describing the word. My point is you can retain pictures more easily than words. And it helps, at least in my case it did. And not a single word in my GRE was outside the set of words in Wordbot.Overall, it was a rewarding experience for me. And lastly, it is always up to you to take maximum use of the resources of any program. I understand it becomes hard especially if you are working on a job, but it helped me. And, as someone has already said, it ultimately boils down to the amount of effort you make.So, all the best!","I Galvanize is a good option for GRE preparation. ( My GRE Score: 306/340)In the first place, there was no specific cause for choosing Galvanize and I opted for it reading some of the reviews in the internet which told mentioned provide a pretty good course material designed to help you achieve your target score.After completing my journey with Galvanize I am putting forward my personal opinion for it as your GRE Guide.

Although, Galvanize does have their own pool of words, but somehow I liked Magoosh app which may be due to the reason that I had already started learning from it before I took Galvanize.According to me, I feel that the best strategy for cracking GRE would be to practice Manhattan 5 lb book and give the corresponding section tests from Galvanize which would help you to highlight your progress considering the time limit factor.Finally, summarizing the pros and cons of Galvanize:-PROS:Structured Material: All the sections (Verbal and Quant) are nicely divided that help you brush through and be thorough with the different topics.Reasonable Pricing.There are webinars covering each topics in detail, from the basics of each chapter of quant to the details of tricks and tips for verbal section.

That really helped me a lot.CONS:For the wordlist, sentences should be provided along with the words so as to get the meaning in a more contextual way.Galvanize should build a word pool of their own rather than directing to an external website for the vocab prep.Well, having said these, I thank the team for their support and would strongly recommend Galvanize for GRE. Follow the course sincerely besides practicing the Manhattan Book and you should achieve your target score!Good luck for all those who look forward to take up this exam.","Picking a study source for the GRE can be tormenting and quiet frankly bewildering.

GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:20 online tests800Score's Free Full Length Revised GRE TestMyGRETutor's 4 free Full Length TestsKaplan's Free Practice Test Options for the GREPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length testIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!Originally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?","Whee! GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"

GRE,How to prepare for GRE verbal reasoning?,https://www.quora.com//How-to-prepare-for-GRE-verbal-reasoning,"Verbal Reasoning (GRE), GRE Preparation, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Exam and Test Preparation",100+,"These are the things I followed and managed to get a pretty decent score after preparing for 15-16 days. Barrons and Kaplan are excellent books to prepare for GRE, but before you start the real preparation, you want to know as many words as possible, for which the general suggestion everyone gives is reading Barrons wordlist.Most people do start off trying to read and remember those 3500 words from Barrons wordlist. But as I have noticed, a very high percentage of people give up within the first week and probably even before they finish words starting with 'a'. That might be for the following reasons:way too many words: if you have an amazing vocabulary and you are aware of most of the words, then its fine. But I am assuming thats not the case with most of us. Once you actually start reading and you know how much time you take to go through say a 100 words, its very discouraging to have that huge a set of words ahead of you.words are in alphabetical order: you have this whole page of words, say 40-50 words in a single page, so many times the first 3-4 characters will be the same for all of them, that is very very confusing. You will spend hours trying to memorize and yet you will horribly fail.content is compressed: if you buy the book having wordlist or if you manage to get a pdf copy, you will notice that the words and meanings are printed in small font and there is barely any space to write down any notes.So this is what I did:I came across this website http://www.majortests.com where you get 15 wordlists, each wordlist containing 100 words, thats 1500 words totally. In each wordlist, these 100 words are again subdivided into lists of 10 words each and now these 10 words dont start with the same letter. For example, 1st 10 words will be ""abhor, bigot, counterfeit, enfranchise, hamper, kindle, noxious, placid, remuneration, talisman"", and then the next 10 words will be ""abrasive, bilk, covert, engender, hangar, knotty, nuance, plagiarism, renown, tangent"" and so on. So its easier to read and remember these words.Secondly, the wordlists that you download from the above website have  exactly 20 words per page, and half of the page (right hand side column) is left blank to take down notes.If you still find it difficult to memorize words, or you want to be a 100% sure that you remember the words you read once, then you could try mnemonics, an easy way to remember meanings (thanks to gp). Go to http://www.mnemonicdictionary.com and type the word you want mnemonic for, and choose from the list of mnemonics available. This website is just like quora in the sense that mnemonics are arranged in the descending order of the number of upvotes they get. I used to write these mnemonics as notes in the wordlists I had got printed, that way I didnt have to go to the website again even if I forgot the mnemonic.(In the end, if you think you have a lot of time left, then you could go through Barrons high frequency words wordlist, you dont want to miss out on any obvious ones.)Once you are done with wordlists, then starts your actual preparation. As I mentioned earlier, go through ETS, Barrons and Kaplan practice books. Read the tips and tricks given at the beginning of every chapter, trust me they help a lot. Then go through the practice questions given at the end of every chapter. Do verify whether your answers are correct or not, that is the whole point of solving them.Go through as many practice tests as possible. A safe minimum number of tests to be taken would be 10. You get 2 tests from ETS, 2 from Barrons if you have bought the book, and you will find several other paid/unpaid tests online. If you are taking online tests, make sure you have good internet connection probably 3g, you dont want any test to go waste mid way through. Take complete tests: no matter how confident you are about your quant, no matter how painstaking and boring essay writing may seem, its necessary you practice sitting for 4 hours in from of a computer and get an estimate of time required per question. Once you get the score after giving the practice test, go through the questions you answered wrong, even if you have got a good score. It would be a good idea to leave practice tests given by ETS for last, it gives you an idea of what the questions look like in the actual GRE, since they use the same formatting at both places.Even though I mentioned 15-16 days in the beginning, I think preparing for around 2 months would be a better idea.","This link offers the best GRE Guide: The Ultimate GRE Guide - Cafe EnginerdThe verbal section in the link is described as follows,Verbal Prep:The key to cracking verbal is to know the words.

It is not humanly possible to remember the words in one go. The best method to remember words is to by remembering the example. Make sure you read the words so many times that you must remember not only the example but even the word that is next in line ;p. You can also do words from those Barron 800 or other 1000 words book. But they will simply be a repetition from Word Power.After you feel satisfied with the words, you can start off with the 5lb and other practice books. There is also some GMAT 1000. Do essays properly and understand how to read them. Reading is not as important as understanding what to read. Learn how to read. There is no method in this apart from quickly skimming and understanding what was written in which para. Read the question and find the answer properly in that para. Also, learn which essays to leave during the exam as some are very tough (literally greek) and will waste your time for the other easy questions.For more doubts about MS in US visit us: Masters - Cafe Enginerd and send your queries to cafeenginerd@gmail.com. Happy to Help!","The below study method is tried and tested by me and I'm hopeful that it would help you guys :) To excel at GRE Verbal, one has to have a good vocabulary. To bag a good vocabulary, make it a habit of reading newspapers daily because newspapers offer wide range of working vocabulary  related to different genres. I would recommend American newspapers (like Nytimes.com)  because the writing style closely matches with that of the content that appears in the exam. Coming to Indian newspapers, we all know that it has to be THE HINDU and nothing else. Observe every new word and understand its meaning. Revise it regularly.(Vocabulary.com  does a very good job for you in this. It tells you everything that you need to know about a word. Also, you can make word lists).  Try to use the words in your daily life.  One to two months of this reading should suffice. Now coming to cracking the individual sections of the verbal. 1)Reading Comprehension.Follow the simple steps mentioned in Manhattan Reading Comprehension book and practice diligently. 2)Text Completion and Sentence Equivalence Follow Manhattan text completion and sentence equivalence book. Very good hacks are mentioned in the book. It would be very useful. Again practice thoroughly. 3)  Practice questions from the book Manhattan 5lb practice as the above mentioned books do not offer sufficient number of questions. This book offers wide range of books in varying difficult levels.  In short, a good reading vocabulary equipped with the hacks mentioned in the above mentioned books will get you above 157 easily. Happy learning :)","“I studied in a Telugu medium school. My English skills are just okay, and I find the GRE Verbal Reasoning section intimidating. How do I face it?”“Ever since I turned a teen, I had been force-fed on The Hindu, Reader’s Digest, and the Time. Reading is now my favorite pastime. Yet, why do I find the Verbal Reasoning section of the GRE challenging?”At and between these two extremes is where students preparing for GRE fall. In my experience of 7 years as the Co founder of GREedge and having trained 30000+ students, I have realized that the Verbal Reasoning section is no cake walk for anyone. It can be, with methodical approach and some serious practice.Let’s approach this problem backward by analyzing what exactly can be challenging in the Verbal section of GRE:The answer choices can be tricky. For most TC, SE, & RC questions, while you may easily eliminate some of the choices, you will often be left with at least two choices that are close to being the correct answer choice. Choosing the correct one among them can be challenging.You might find some of the words in the question statement or the answer choices alien to you. In SE, where you have to choose two words with similar meanings for the blanks, this can particularly be challenging.The subject of the RC passage might be unfamiliar to you. Club it with some strange vocabulary and difficult language, and you can be thrown out of gear.“Choose all that apply” type of questions in RC. Considering that you don’t get any points for partially correct answers, this can be quite a pain, if you are not prepared.The logic and reasoning that is required in solving TC triple-blank questions and the RC passage questions can be challenging.Okay, now to the solutions. How do you overcome these challenges?Start by learning the most-important GRE words, which is about 3500 in number. Remember, GRE vocab is more about context and so focus on the contexts in which the words are used. The usage statements in dictionaries will help you in this aspect.As a simple example, though the words, “inflexible” and “obdurate” are synonymous, you wouldn’t use one in place of the other, right? It would be wrong to call an “inflexible schedule” to be an “obdurate schedule,” because the word, “obdurate,” refers to someone who is not flexible since he doesn’t wish to be so. An “obdurate” person refuses to move to sensitive emotional appeals.So, the point is, focus on the contextual usage of words. A good place to understand such nuances is the “synonym discussions” in Merriam Webster dictionary.Next, read good quality newspapers and periodicals. Read on your topic of interest. To describe the technique, I would like to share my personal experience here.I just got an update on the swimming competition at Rio Olympics and here’s what I learnt out of this snippet from The Guardian:I’ve been asked by reader Olympia Diamond if we ever got to the bottom of the manky green pool situation from yesterday. Yes and no? FINA put a statement out yesterday that included the following: FINA can confirm that the reason for the unusual water color observed during the Rio diving competitions is that the water tanks ran out of some of the chemicals used in the water treatment process.“As a result, the pH level of the water was outside the usual range, causing the discoloration. The FINA Sport Medicine Committee conducted tests on the water quality and concluded that there was no risk to the health and safety of the athletes, and no reason for the competition to be affected.”The old ran-out-of-chemicals defense. The water polo pool (next door) has a tinge of green to it now as well. I sense this story has some way to run.(A quick tip: FINA is the International Swimming Federation that is authorized by the International Olympic Committee to conduct international aquatic contests.)Okay, I might have just read this article, formed my own opinion of FINA, and move on to the next article, if I wasn’t going to take up my GRE. But, since I have my GRE now, I give it a second reading. I first understand the subject. It is about the sub-standard pool condition in the 2016 Olympics.I then mark new words (“manky” is one) in the article, look up the meaning, synonym/antonym, and usage statements in the dictionary. I open an Excel sheet and mark all such words that I pick up during the day. (Not trusting my memory, I do a weekly revision of this list.)Next, I look at places where the author is giving his opinion. Is he being critical of FINA or is he being supportive? Which is the statement in this article that indicates his opinion or tone? How is he concluding the write-up? Are there any gaps in his argument? Is he sounding biased?With this approach, you build not only your vocabulary but also your logic and reasoning skills. Gradually, move toward reading topics of serious interest, such as the Opinion and Editorial write-ups. Such writings are of more serious nature and you will get exposure to higher-order words, sentences, arguments, and contexts. This would largely help you in your Verbal Reasoning section of GRE.Finally, practice a number of TC, SE, & RC exercises. While there are trainers aplenty, go for quality trainers who know their job. Stick to the study plan that they provide. Practice a lot and take up timed tests. You will excel!"
GRE,How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-plan-my-preparation-for-the-GRE,"GRE Preparation, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"Reposting from my other answer: Austin Li's answer to What is the best way to prepare for a competitive exam (CAT/GRE/GMAT) in 1 year without paying any tuition?The quick and dirty guide for the GRE: Raise your score by 10 - 20 in a week!Note: I'm writing this because my girlfriend might be taking the GRE in a few months and I wanted to write a guide for her. I'm a lazy prick. I don't like to study, and despite buying the Barron's, the Kaplan, and the Official guide, I only studied about 2% of the content in a week. I started on the diagnostic test and got 160 quant, 150 verbal. On the real test I got a 164 quant, 163 verbal, and 5.5 AWA. The AWA is a joke. Read on and I'll show you how to nail it. If you're reading this and taking the test in a week, most of these tips will still help. This is probably the most helpful strategy. It keeps your time management spot on, and it frees your mind from the stress of remembering your thoughts when the mental fatigue starts getting to you. Before the test starts and in-between test sections, you are given a few minutes of time. Use all of this time to prepare. Lay out the scrap paper in landscape and use a pen to make a deductive logic grid. Don't bother with a ruler making pretty lines, just make sure you do it and label the question numbers in an easy way to read.The problems usually have 4 to 5 multiple choice options. If you're unsure of the answer, you will usually be able to tell 2 to 3 choices to be wrong if you know the math and the vocabulary words, and a remainder of 2 choices that you're unsure about/forgot the meaning/couldn't figure out the final steps of the math.Grid: Note that on the verbal section, do not fill in the question number as there will be some questions of multiple blanks that you need to each fill correctly to gain credit (Killer!), so label those questions ""1 a, 1 b, 1 c"".Take at most roughly a minute for each question. Since the new revision it is less important to ensure you get the first few questions right. If you see an answer that is wrong, mark an ""X"" on to the grid for that choice. If you see an answer that you are unsure about between two, mark an ""O"" on the grid.On the verbal section where a question has multiple blanks to fill, you will probably end up with a question that you are not sure about on almost all the choices, of which you need to chain the ""O""s together to see which one makes sense. There are only 6 combinations on 3 blanks, each with 2 unsure choices. Eliminate from those and you'll end up with 2 to 3 choices, and will raise your probability of success from 1/27 (3 choices on 3 blanks) to about 1/2.5 (2 choices on 3 blanks, with 3-4 of 6 combinations eliminated)Circle the question numbers that you are unsure of. When you're done with the section, you can zoom back quickly and identify the question you need to check and redo.ALWAYS PICK AN ANSWER. A guess still counts to points!Buy the flash cards and sleep with them. If you've already bought them but are not sleeping with them, start doing so now. Bring them around with you to dinner, to gaming, to socializing and on and on. Break the pile of flash cards into loops of 50 cards. Study through one loop each day, and move on to the next. On the two days after you've finished a loop, do a written test with the flashcard loop only showing the word but no definition. In seven days you'll have memorized 250 words for the GRE. Always pick from flashcards of a ""most frequent"" list to cover high probability words.The AWA is a joke. Lots of people lose unnecessary points on it because of cultural practices and because of the personality of writing they present that not all test assessors will like. It's a human reading your essay, not a robot, don't buy the argument that they don't make mistakes and don't judge your personal writing style.ANALYZE AN ISSUEFirst, take a look at the ""Analyze an Issue"" brief from the website:Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoningfor the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.Write a response in which you discuss your views on the policy and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider the possible consequences of implementing the policy and explain how these consequences shape your position.Notice how all of them point out whether you agree or disagree, and why. Your first sentence in this section should always state the extent you agree or disagree. The second sentence should always highlight the major reasons why you agree or disagree, and ideally should be in Serial commaformat. ""... agree/disagree because of AAA, BBB, and CCC""From those points, you have your paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with defining your exact argument, and be followed by a second sentence that explains how your argument connects/enhances/weakens the issue at hand. Pick arguments that build upon each other and in the summary paragraph, summarize them, and briefly restate your position.ANALYZE AN ARGUMENTTake a look at the model answer on the official site:Analyze an ArgumentWhen you look at the model answer here's the results it gives to these three important questions:Is the claim valid or not? Yes, it may be a valid claim to increase the funding. [Take note that it's very important to separate the validity of the claim and the validity of the reasoning behind the claim.]Is the reasoning behind the claim valid or not? No, the survey may be wrong in its scope, validity, and relevance. [There is almost always a numerical piece of data in the passage that could be attacked or could have its assumptions pointed out.]Are there problems in the logical structure that undermine the argument, but not the claim? Yes, the cause of the smell and low quality of the water has not been established to be able to be ""cleaned"" effectively, and that no causal link has been established between water quality and usage has been established. [This type of logical structure usually is slippery slope logic. Read below.]Note that the farther you deviate from the evidence at hand and spin your own theories, the more assumptions you make and the weaker your argument becomes. If you look at the score 5 and score 4 essays, their logical attacks are less well explained and less grounded on to the evidence and structure of the argument.Pay attention to Slippery slope structures like the example. A slippery slope generally builds on a long chain of seemingly reasonable assumptions to arrive at unreasonable or poorly supported arguments. Take this example of a mom warning a child not to goto a party, because a party might have bad kids, that might befriend the child in question, and over time might introduce the child to drugs or alcohol as they grow up, that might develop into an addiction, that might then ruin high school grades, then destroy chances at college admissions, and ultimately fail to secure a well paying job, then ruin the child's life. From each jump the logical leap may seem small, but in the end the argument becomes going to party = life ruined. Attacking the statistical validity, the logical connection between one argument and another, the assumptions made on the evidence that determines whether it is circumstantial or irrefutable become the major points of the essay. Avoid the urge to impress the writers by using fancy words and complex grammatical structures. Use the KISS principle and write in straightforward wording to allow your argument to come out with a strong tone.","When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.Note: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.1. First Month: ConditioningAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don't have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.First Three Weeks: Work out (don't just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.In parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well) Fourth Week: Time for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don't forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)Meanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.So, it's been one month now. Don't expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull's Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way Now it's time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don't think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I'm going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.First Three Weeks:Sign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It's a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.Join the New GRE group on Facebook. It's the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:Members post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.Secondly, it's a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation. You'll get access to some really USEFUL links.The next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.The last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don't forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.Now you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it's time for some real action !!Fourth WeekTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that's all its useful for. Don't expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racerFirst Two WeeksPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don't leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don't, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn't take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I'm telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.Last Two WeeksIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I'd read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5.

GRE is the one exam I had a lot of fun preparing for.One year is plenty of time, so you're good to do. How you should go about preparing for the GRE depends a lot on where you stand right now.The Quantitative Reasoning (Math) part of the exam is fairly easy for anyone with an engineering background, so that can be tackled by solving a few practice tests to ensure that your speed and accuracy is adequate. Aim at getting ALL questions correct.The Verbal Reasoning part of the exam is where most Indian students need plenty of preparation. It's important to understand here that the VR part doesn't intend to test just your vocabulary, per se. Rather, it intends to test your reasoning and analytical skills, and vocabulary is just tool. Through comprehension exercises and other questions, the aim is to see how well you can analyze arguments and draw conclusions from a given text.Vocabulary Try and gauge your vocabulary by attempting a few tests given in the Barrons GRE book. If you feel it's decent (you know at least 50% of the words), your job is rather easy. In my case, I could attempt about 65%. If you feel it's lacking, there is this red book (now it is white) called Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis that a lot of students seem to love. I have only read it occasionally, so I don't have a strong opinion about it, but its etymology approach is useful, especially if you've never seen language that way. It is good for vocabulary, but you'd better ignore its grammar advice.Try to at least complete the word lists given in Barrons. It's not exhaustive, but it's a fairly good collection. There are about 3500 words in there, and it will take you a fair amount of time if your vocabulary isn't great to begin with. Expect to spend about 3-4 hours per word list.Apart from this, you can check out online resources tooReasoningThis will come largely with practice. As you work on the vocabulary, keep solving practice tests and analyze how many of your errors were not because of vocabulary issues but because of logical / reasoning issues. These are the ones you need to work on. You'll get better with practice, and will also improve your vocabulary alongside. As I said earlier, the GRE is not a test of raw vocabulary. Instead of merely mugging up words, try to put them in context. Get a feel of how those words are used, where those words are used. Get a sense of whether a word is used in an approving sense or a disapproving sense. Try to appreciate the nuances between words that appear very similar in meaning but are still not interchangeable.This is what will help you more, both in life and in the examination.Closing NotesIf you prepare well and prepare properly, you'd come off with a much stronger vocabulary and reasoning ability. This is a useful asset in academia, as well as in everyday life.Students who start with relatively low vocabulary and then ramp up significantly during GRE preparation often suffer from what I call obnoxious-word-usage-syndrome, where an over-enthusiastic attempt to use the newly acquired vocabulary results in prose that is not only pathetic but that often makes little sense. This can be easily remedied if you spend time in understanding exactly how / where a particular word is used (as mentioned above)","I did my prep in a week. So two months is a solid amount of time.First familiarize yourself with the test pattern. The Magoosh prep videos are really good for it. Know what the sections are, approximately how much time to spend on each question and stick to it. You'll get two free practice test from ETS itself (using the Powerprep software). Go through the untimed section once and also give one of the tests (timed). So you'll have a basic idea of how your test will be. The GRE is a bit longer in duration than many other exams ( about 4 hrs). You should be able to keep a cool head in these 4 hours. Apart from the ETS practice tests you can find 3 other standardized tests (free) i.e Manhattan, Kaplan and Princeton GRE Practice Test. Or you can always buy the test package from one of the reputed institutes, but do use the three aforementioned tests. If you buy the Official GRE ETS guide, you'll get two more tests (paper-based), so I strongly recommend you get it.You will have 6 sections on the test. First you will face the AWA (Analytical) Section. Out of the 5 sections left, only 4 of them will be used for calculating your score for the test. The other one is an experimental section. They say that ETS has implemented this in order to gauge the general performance of the test takers and also for analysis for their future test papers. We will not know which is the experimental section so please do not waste any sort of time trying to figure out which one is the experimental section.We do know that after the AWA section, you will have the Quantitative and Verbal sections in a random order. The scores calculated will be taken from 2 Verbal sections and 2 Quantitative Sections. So it is important that you perform well in all the sections. You will have an optional 10-minutes break after the first three sections.So now you've given a practice test and you can roughly identify the area you are weak at. Lets tackle the Verbal section first.(As this is a nightmare to most of us)The key to scoring a 160+ in this section is a really strong vocabulary. Yes there are numerous word lists available, but don't start with them first. The Magoosh GRE Flashcards app is an absolutely brilliant foundation builder. Download the app and keep going through the words. Do it everyday or whenever you get 15mins of free time. You can also find it online in case you don't have a smartphone. It covers about 1000 words that will give you enough ammo for test. But this will probably not cover all the words that will appear in your GRE. You can then proceed with the word lists. Also two things that helped me here were 'Word Power Made Easy' and the 'Magoosh Vocab Wednesday Videos' (I strongly recommend you use the videos as much as possible). WPME equips you with a sound understanding of etymology and makes you learn new words with ease. Although it requires some commitment and patience, it is recommended only if you have too much time on your hands !Possessing a large vocab is like having a machine gun with tons of ammo. But its of no use if you do not know how to fire the gun ! You need to have the ability to understand the question clearly. You need to keep your train of thought connected as you read thorough the question and recognize what the question is asking for (this for all types RC, Sentence Completion). Also in the Reading Comprehension you might come across huge ones with relatively tough questions. The only way to fire the gun properly now is by practice. Practice practice and practice. The Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all really helpful for the amount of questions they have all together. Inbox me if you need any sort of material. I can share it over Google Drive. Don't be disheartened if your answers are mostly incorrect. Read the explanations given for the answers and understand how to approach the question. I was terrible at the beginning, but trust me the more you practice, the better you will become. You have to keep the factor of time in mind too. Remember all the questions in the GRE have the same value. If you are not able to answer the question mark it and move on to the next one. Just be sure to get back to it later. If you don't have the time for it, might as well guess the answer blindly ! You have a decent amount of time so you should be able to cover a lot of material.Next the Quantitative section. This is relatively the easier section and a score of 170 is pretty much possible. I recommend to buy the 'ETS Official Guide to the GRE® revised General Test, Second Edition'. Read through the Quantitative Prep Section throughly. It covers all the topics and concepts that you need to know for the GRE. The official guide also comes with two additional practice tests apart from the Powerprep software, that are really good. ETS prepares the GRE examination that you will be appearing for, so there is no better material (for both verbal and quant) that will give you an idea of how the questions will be. Once you've read the concepts go back to the mantra of practicing. Practice practice and practice. Remember the essence of these question will be simple. But the question will not look so. It will be tricky and manipulative (pretty much like some of our ""friends""). You should be able to clearly understand what the question is asking for and work on it accordingly. Practicing tons and loads of questions will help here. Again the Manhattan 5lb book of GRE practice problems, Princeton GRE material, Kaplan GRE material, Manhattan GRE material are all helpful for the amount of questions they possess. Do inbox me if you need any material. Keep practicing meticulously. Don't give up if you aren't able to get the correct answers. Read through the explanation and understand how to approach the question. You can easily achieve a score of 165+. Go back to the areas you find tough, read through the concepts and practice more questions. For the multiple answers be sure to look at all the options. Few of the Data Interpretation questions will be straightforward and the others will be simple but lengthy. The ETS Material will give you a good idea of the various graphs and plots that may appear on your test day. Also get a good grip over the 'Quartiles' concept which is there in the ETS material. Grasping the concepts should not take much time but you have to apply them correctly in the examination. Commit and practice till you reach a point where no matter what the question is in front of you, you should be able to attempt it. Carefully see what the question is asking for and answer accordingly. Practice is the key for a high score in the Quant section too ! (If you are an Indian student you will have less difficulty in understanding the quant concepts as most of the topics will be covered in high school math. But without practice, the questions can even trick the highly intelligent students) Next, the AWA Section. This is actually the first section that you will face in the GRE. Now, I am not really one to give you advice for this section as I did pretty bad here. Don't get me wrong. I love absolutely writing (though I am not really good with spellings). Anything from flash fiction to poetry. But I like to do it at my own pace. The GRE however gives you only 30 mins for each essay hence I wasn't at much ease. Also I did not practice for this section at all. (No wonder I didn't score well). You'll face two essays; the 'Issue Task' and the 'Argument Task'. The ""Issue Task"" presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how to respond to that issue. You have to evaluate the issue, consider its complexities and develop an argument with reasons and examples to support your views. The ""Argument Task"" requires you to evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions. You will need to consider the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.I do know that reading through numerous essay (especially the ones that scored a 6 or 5) will give you the approach strategy. The topic pool can be found on the ETS website so do give them a read. You have loads of time, so you should be able to have a planned out method to tackle this section. Also look at the 'SparkNotes GRE section"" online to find good tips for approaching this section. I've read on various blogs that for the engineering programs the schools do not give much importance to the AWA score. But if you are looking to pursue a grad program in literature or journalism, you'll need a real good AWA score.The Practice Tests.You should have atleast 5 Practice tests (the free ones I mentioned before) in hand and space them out according to your convenience and how comfortable you are with the topics. If you buy the Official ETS guide you will have two additional tests (paper-based) so I would definitely suggest you buy the guide. There is no fixed timetable for giving the tests. You give it as per your comfort level. The score you get on the ETS Practice test is quite a good approximation of what you will get on the test day so give one of the ETS Practice test a few days before your GRE. Now I had a week's time so I gave one test a day. I was able to gauge my performance after each test and scope out what I needed to work on. Do look into the explanations of the answers. Remember you should try and avoid making the same mistake twice. Keep track of your mistakes by writing them down and glance at them later before you give another test.Finally, the Test Day Section. Yes as silly as it sounds, the test day matters the most. Your nerves on the test day can either boost your performance or wreck your examination. You've done all the practice you can and now its your time to perform . Do get a good amount of sleep the night before. Keep all the required IDs with you. Reach the test center earlier than your reporting time. Carry along a small snack and a bottle of water. Keep your cool throughout the examination. If you are stuck and unable to proceed, take a deep breath and relax. It helps ! You have done loads of practice you will be able to crack that silly question but this time with a calmer state of mind. It is very easy to lose patience if you feel are't doing well but keep it together for these 4 hours and you should be able to achieve an well rounded score. Don't give up if one of your sections didn't go well you have the other sections to make up for it. But if you've practiced enough you will never have to be in that position ! Also don't worry about which section is the experimental section. As far as you are concerned, you have to do well in all the sections. Do take the 10 mins break after 3 sections to come back with a refreshed mind.If you don't get a good score or atleast what you aimed, remember GRE is not the end ! I could not get the score I aimed for and initally I was disappointed. Soon I realized that its really of no use worrying about it. What you've got is what you've got. If needed you can appear for the GRE again within 21 days, though I wouldn't recommend it (unless you got a really bad score and are willing to pay the fee for writing the examination again). I prepared exactly how I have described in the above paragraphs. I score 328 and 331 in my last two mock tests. So I was pretty confident going into the examination. But the test day nerves got to me. I was fumbling with words in the AWA section. Quantitative section I did well, but I was aiming for a perfect 170 and fell short by 3 marks. During one of the Verbal sections I had the sudden urge to pee. I had about 8 questions left with 10 minutes on the clock. Though I begged the invigilators, I was not allowed to go to the restroom till the 10 mins break. And that pretty much broke my momentum. So I came back to the rest of the sections with a cool mind, a real desire for revenge (too much drama, I know !) and breezed though them with much more ease. Hopefully the nerves won't get to you ! Best of luck in cracking the GRE ! I'll be glad to help if you need more guidance. Let us know how your exam goes. Cheers !Sorry for the long post ! Here's a Potato :(Image source : Tumblr)"
