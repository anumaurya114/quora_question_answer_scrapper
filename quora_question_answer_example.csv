CAT Exam,How was your CAT 2017 result?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-your-CAT-2017-result,"Cat 2017 Results, CAT 2017 Exam Score, CAT (Common Admission Test) 2017, Common Admission Test (CAT)",45,"Going anonymous for personal reason.I have always battled anxiety. India is a strange country. Whenever you have an anxiety attack where you feel that everything is shit and you have lost the battle and there is no hope. People will dismiss your feeling by saying “Nautanki mat karo” (Dont pretend). But deep down you know that when other people are calm and smiling, your heart is racing, your mind is making noises, you are afraid and there is no one to calm you down. You are all alone.Getting back to me, in any exam and sometimes on a regular day, my heart will race. There were times when I will not be able to communicate with the shopkeepers for merely buying things. I was working as well as preparing for CAT, losing focus, gaining focus. In the month of September (two months before CAT) - I even went to psychiatrist for help. He prescribed me some pills. And along with this I was preparing for CAT.I had just one goal. Finish with the exam. If you screw up, you should not blame anyone. You should own whatever blunder or things you would achieve. I took two weeks off from the office and gave everything to it. My percentile were never in my favor. Always lying in the range of 60–80%. The last mock percentile I achieved was 65%. (This was one week before the exam)In all these commotions , I learned one thing. Getting riled up and all worked up will never solve the problem. I would always look at Dhoni and Ronaldo . I learnt calmness from them. Even if the sky is about to break loose, these two will be calm and quiet. They will not worry. I started to do regular Pranayam - so that i can be in the more control of my brain.In early days, when these attack would come, I would be all riled up. I will leave everything . And in some corner of my home - I would overthink myself to death. But this time, I was not going to do these things. I just kept this 65% in one of the corners of my brain and worked on my problems.On the exam day, I had just one goal. Just finish the exam. I had the morning batch and thankfully I was in control of myself. Yes, after seeing DI/LR section - I thought that it is all over. I am shit, I cannot compete in India. But within minutes - I was back in control. And finally I finished the exam with all the best I can give.The result came. And it looked something like thisVA-RC: 99.4, DI/LR: 92.29, QA: 79.83. Overall: 94.9After the result, I was happy. May be this was my destiny. May be if I would have scored more than 80% in QA, IIM would have increased their sectional cutoff to 85%. I cannot predict future.For now I have converted good colleges and will be leaving my job to pursue my MBA.. (Those colleges that don’t consider sectional :p)But in the end, I learned the followingI won from myself. My competition was not from student who were achieving more than 95% in mocks but with me.I didn’t lose hope till the end.And yes, people like me who battle depression and anxiety. I have just one message for you“YOU ARE HELL OF A WARRIOR. YOU BATTLE YOURSELF EVERY SECOND. AND YOU ALWAYS WIN. NEVER COMPARE YOURSELF TO ANYONE. YOU HAVE YOUR OWN BATTLE AND YOU HAVE TO WIN IT”","As I take CAT exam regularly, to understand my performance in CAT17, it would be good to compare with my CAT16 scores. I will put both my scorecards here and will then compare with regards to my learning from the CAT exam.CAT1 7 was an easier exam as compared to CAT16. The last person to score a 100%ile in CAT16 was around 219 whereas in CAT17 was around 229. Purely on overall score, my scores in CAT17 is poorer as compared to CAT16 as in CAT16 I was 30 marks more than the last person who scored 100%ile and in CAT17 this gap reduced to around 16 marks. If you compare the marksheets, you will realise the main reason for the same was the Verbal section.Verbal Section: This has been my Archilles heel for many years right from the time I started to prepare for CAT in my college days. I have done no major preparation for Verbal section over the years and the only reason I score well in Verbal is because I read a lot and some help from my wife. Both in CAT15 and CAT16 I scored a 99.9+ in Verbal. Both those years I ensured that I read a lot during the 3 months before the exam date. One of the years I read the whole Harry Potter Series and in the other year I read Lord of the Rings apart from some other books. But in CAT17 I became a tad overconfident. As I had got 99.9+ in both my previous attempt, I thought it would not be difficult to repeat the feat. Which is why I did not read much before the CAT17 exam, and the result are there in the score card. I lost more than 20 marks in CAT17 in the Verbal section even though the section was supposed to be easier. This just underlines the importance of reading during the months before the exam.DILR: I have scored a 100%ile in both CAT16 and CAT17 in this section thanks to the learning from CAT15 DILR paper. When I wrote the CAT15 paper I did keep a target of solving all questions in this section. But the paper was tougher than what I had predicted and that resulted in a little panic during the exam. I realised that I should not keep targets in the exam as it just builds stress. In both these exams I went with a cool mind and decided to solve as much as I can even if it means just 1 set. This helped me to relax during the CAT17 test and managed to solve 7 sets and did intelligent guess for the 8th set.Maths: My marks in Maths improved, but my percentile was down as CAT17 maths section was easier. Maths is a section where even though I scored well every year and a few 100%iles in this section, I end up having self doubts. The following are the reasons for the same:Every year my students ask me a lot of doubts from different mocks and for a lot of questions I have to say - I dont know, I dont think this will come in the CAT exam as it is beyond what you are supposed to know. - After saying I dont know many times you start wondering whether you really know the CAT exam.To add to this i have completely shunned watching various social media groups where I feel ashamed to say I am a maths teacher after going though the questions that are put up. Half the things just goes above my head.Going through the mocks I also realised that if I solve the mocks I will not be able to do well in the test.Luckily for me I have solved in the exam almost all the questions that have come in the CAT for the last 10+ years. This year too I solved all questions with 3 incorrect, Out of the 3 questions I went wrong, I solved two questions correctly but ended up marking the wrong answer. The last one the method did not click in the exam, though I knew how to solve it. To add to this my students end up doing really well in the exam every year which helps to boost my confidence as a teacher.Learning for Maths section is - dont get too much into formula as CAT does not check you on that. Focus on learning the Maths concepts that are there in your school. Learn to solve easy questions with alternate methods and skip the tough questions. That is the key in the exam, solving the easy ones and leaving the tough ones.My advise: Read a lot. Don’t keep targets, solve how much you can. Learn to leave the tough questions and solve the easy ones.Persevere, even if you feel that CAT is tough. I have seen my students not scoring more than 90%ile in mocks ending up with 99+ in actual CAT. — Darr ke aage Jeet Hai.","This was my 3rd CAT attempt.Background:Gave first attempt during my graduation final year in 2015. Prepared my ass off in 7th semester to witness abysmal score in CAT 15. Just got a meagre 83.*(60.* in VaRc :( )Joined an IT company from college placement. Just for 5 months and left it; I was desperate to crack this time and was totally bitten by MBA bug. Gave full fledged mocks for 2 months only to get bitten by cat once more. This time got a paltry 89.*(VaRc-72). Caveat is got 94 in XAT but as destiny planned I couldn't clear section cutoff in quant.(got 98 in verbal here..lol)Thought of joining some random job but I thought what is the point of doing a job just for the sake of doing. I went full throttle this time, prepared hard, cleared all the basic, and read newspapers, novels,magazines to improve my verbal skills.Gave around 35 mocks this time scoring 85–97 percentiles in IMS,TIME mocks. I was totally confident of acing CAT this time.And the d-day comes:Slot 1:Cruised VARC in 50 mins, attempted-33Totally baffled in DILr and totally messed here, attempted 07(yes, fucking seven)Lost hope of clearing cat by this time.And ,quant it was a breeze and attempted 31.I was expecting a total of 140–150 based on key released by IIM.Result day:After completion of XAT, I was coming to my home town from Bangalore and a friend of mine called and said result is out.My heart started pounding and all the hardwork I did, risk of leaving my job flashed infront of my eyes.I downloaded the admit card and checked my resultOa:89.*Varc:77Dilr:54Quant: 98I was totally started and went numb for an hour. All the negative thoughts popped into my mind and I felt like useless piece of shit. I did all I can still I fumbled on d-day.Lessons learnt:Don't put all your stakes on CAT if you are GEM(general , Engineer, Male)Never leave your job unless you are confirm of scoring 99.5+Don't refrain yourself from all the fun in the name of preparation. CAT is just another exam.Have a backup option. It eases the pressure off.","I was a very very weak student. I scored pretty bad in academics. In CAT 2017 I got 182.91 getting 99.44%ile ith 91%ile in Verbal(Shocked as I never got even 80%ile in Mocks). I used to get in 60s in Class 10,12 and Graduation.I hardly got any good calls. Now I think MBA is only for guys or girls who are good in rote learning. I do not know how narrow minded these IIMs are ,they are just judging people’s intelliegence by how much they were good in past. Are we aware in past that we would do MBA and IIMs would see marks. This kind of stone age mentality is what is stopping India to grow and even IIMs to be in league of Top B Schools of World. I only wanted IIM BLACK or XLRI but now its not possible and I am sure I wont be able to crack XAT as I was having head ache during XAT and missed all the RCs. Being a Bank PO and even cracked CFA L1 I dont find good to leave this high paying job for some tier 2 College provided I didnt filled up the FMS form. Now I will be just doing CFA and enter into some good finance profile so as to make my status equal to some nerdy IIM Guy."
CAT Exam,What was your height of dedication for CAT preparation?,https://www.quora.com//What-was-your-height-of-dedication-for-CAT-preparation,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",18,"Story of a GEM+ average student with no work experience.In the month of August-September, i decided to write CAT- write, not study. I registered for almost all MBA related exams with the money i had made by working odd jobs. MAT came, I still don’t even know the syllabus or anything, tried to do some 20 questions, answered most others with ‘intuition’(apparently, there is no negative marking-i’m not even sure of that now). I marked many and came out without any thinking, then started collecting notes for CAT. I decided i wont spend on any coaching. I studied basics for around 10–15 days and October was here. Then i started receiving mails from several colleges regarding MBA admission. My dumb ass had forgot about MAT results. I got calls from BIMTECH, LIBA, BIMM, ALLIANCE etc, so many except TAPMI and XIME(the only good colleges i knew which accepted MAT). Then i had the inner calling to check MAT score. 95 percentile. I didn’t understand what percentile was. I spend an entire evening googling percentile, composite score, what a good score is etc. Finally it dawned-MAT was cracked. But i was no more interested in MAT.I started studying for CAT. I searched for inspirational videos to motivate me. Few friends did this actually. Then i started getting up at 4 daily, study till 7, breakfast at my study table while i watch a video on quant/Rc or so, then at 8, restart till 11. Then lunch, a good sleep for 2 hours, restart at around 4–5, take a few breaks, then from 6 to 11 including 1 hour break for dinner and stuff. I had hardly 50 days and had to do same effort as people with 6 month effort because I had to reach their effort level since i wasn’t a scholar or something. I stopped going out of room as such, junk food was stored so i can save time instead of going out and buying(too much ik), dark chocolate, almonds, glucose, etc were 1 feet from me, i had it right before studying. I spent every single rupees i had earned by the end of this. I knew this wasn’t good, because I’m not a genius, i needed more time to understand something and most likely needed the steps to understand most questions.For those who say you can crack CAT in 2 months, don’t generalize. There are many like me who aren’t cracking a question right after reading it. It may take 5 reads to understand the meaning alone. We need more time. We are not the typical geniuses you mention who crack in 2 months.I took 11 mocks in total, with maximum mark of 80 and minimum of 19. But i wasn’t bothered about it, i was more about how to attempt them. My RC was my advantage. I got 50–60 in RC alone. So a quick calculation told me i need just 5–6 in LRDI and 10–15 in quant to get a decent score. And guess what? that’s exactly what i scored- 23 correct in VARC, with 3 wrong, 6 correct in LRDI with 2 wrong, 15 correct in quant with 3 wrong. I got calls from baby IIMs, SPJIMR, MDI and even IIM I. And yes I converted 3 of them- MDI, SPJIMR and the IIM i am in now…at Indore XD.P.S- the high accuracy was not because of my hard work- most was narrowing down to 2 options and choosing one hoping it would be right. Ik it’s not a good thing, but i am no Buddha to follow complete righteousness or so.I answered this question because I’m a middle-back bencher, never scored anything worth telling at all. I passed every exam, but never passed even with average marks. So this is a huge achievement for me.","There’s a time in our life when we feel caged, we want to break free from all the walls we have consciously or unconsciously created around us.Year 2016:Got a salary hike.Happy me!But what about your dreams which you cared a lot in the college?I am earning more than what many of my friends in IT companies are earning.Is this what you wanted from your life?May be, maybe not!Are you going to do this work whole your life?Umm..not so but this is what I can do; I am employed, you see.Aaah, I can feel your inner voice. Are you tired, exhausted, frustrated?Hmm.. I go to the office, so much work to do. It’s natural.Isn’t it natural too to cry every night on your condition and not do anything to change that?I want to, but what should I do? I don’t get time from my office.Everyone has only 24hrs!Yeah.. I understand but what will I do in 2 hrs time I get after office.You wanted to study in IIM. Don’t you?Yes I did but I have to join coaching, spend money and also unpredictability of CAT, you know!You can take an online mock series, study from online sources.Yeah.. got it.Joined IMS online test series, collected free materials from facebook groups, Pagalguy, TotalGadha, friends, some 20 other online sites.Waoh..I have so much materials now without spending a penny!But time is very little for CAT.It’s okay, I will give my best.Fast forward: calls from new IIMs, IIFT. Converted new IIMs except Ranchi.Join it, you will save an year, you will have an IIM tag, this is what you were waiting for.Hmm.. but I am not satisfied with my prep, I want to try again, give it a shot.Umm.. you know unpredictability of CAT, take whatever is coming to you, no one knows future.Yeah but I will not be doing justice to myself, there is still a voice in me which wants more.It’s your life, your choices, your journey, your decisions.Okay, I am going to try again.Still, you will not be having time from your work.No, I will dedicate at least 2-3 hrs daily by compromising on sleep. I have 2-day full weekend to study, to attempt online mocks.2017 :Joined IMS and TIME online mock test series. Self-prep in full swing.More work pressure.Felt anxiety, tiredness, demotivation, packed myself in the room.Only walk outside was room to office, office to room.So many ups and down in life.Stopped talking to everyoneFelt lonelyNo one to helpDaily fight between thoughts and feelingsOnly aim was to get into IIMs, that too better than last yearOh, you know what, even if you score well in CAT, you will have to clear GD and interview.You have to be fearlessSome doubt.. communication is okay but difficult to speak in public.Okay, will offset it with WAT and average GD with high CAT score.Hmm.. you can do it.Felt relieved after good CAT.Released all the soaked pressure by giving a treat to myself in one of the known restaurant in the area.I told you, you will do it. CAT result, wow! Time to prepare for WAT, GD.Calls from IIM L, K, FMS, NITIE, IIFT and new IIMs.Self-prep for GD/PI?Yeah, coachings are charging a hefty sum.You can do it by self.No mock PI? NO!No mock GD? NO!But what?Confidence to crack, knowing yourself, talking to your inner self about what you are, reading on news, knowing your surroundings, your work, places you have lived, your views on any topic.That’s it.Total CAT prep expenses of 2 year: Rs. 2900 total (around 90% discount on IMS/TIME mock)Total Time for self-study: Every single day with one thought in mind, your struggles and your ability to manage yourself than managing time.Rest is history, IIM Kozhikode it is!Life is a struggle, you will hit rock bottom, face humiliation, get mocked, loose self-esteem but one thing is sure, when you will connect the dots, it will have made you a person you always wanted to be!!","I decided to take CAT in 2016. I already had a work experience of 2.5 years and I realized that this year was my do or die situation. Because, by the time I again appear for the CAT next year, I would already be having a work experience of 4 years which would not provide me the edge anymore. So according to me, this was my first and last shot.Now as you know, when you have your back up against the wall, you become desperate and you do anything. Same was the case with me. I was working and my job profile demanded full attention for 10-11 hours. That left me only with 2-3 hours to study. So I left all the beauties of life and chose a life of a workaholic nerd. I used to return home a 10 pm from office. Within one hour, I hurriedly changed, swallowed food and went to bed by 11-11:30 p.m. I still remember those days when I used to crave for having dinner with my family but had to eat early as I need to wake up early the next day and start preparing for CAT. I woke up around 7 a.m. the next day and started solving problems from all the books and materials that I had gathered. By 10 a.m., I used to wrap up everything and leave for office.If you think I was done for the day, You are deeply mistaken!! I took the full advantage of commuting for 1-1.5 hours (one way). I had installed various apps and I solved the VARC section while going to the office. Luckily, that section did not require pen-paper, so it was easier for me to have a look at that section while travelling to office. While returning from office, I used to go through the daily news so that it would help me in the WAT/PI process.I didn’t leave a single opportunity to study in the office as well. When my team members were busy taking a puff or gossiping over lunch, I used to have my lunch at desk, pouring over online Quant problems.The weekends were even more difficult. While most of my friends and colleagues enjoyed, went on dates and watched movies, I used to either attend coaching classes or lock myself in the room taking mocks. I took 2-3 mocks every weekend and I spent the rest of my week analyzing the mocks. For an entire one year, I seldom went out with friends. Yes, for a few people and occasions I do made an exception, but like I said, they were literally few.Luckily, all these paid off and by god’s grace, I am today a member of the IIM family. Being a working professional, without the dedication that I showed, I would not have been able to reach an IIM today. So my advice to you would be: work hard for just a year. You would be able to reap the benefits for the rest of your life. Believe me, you would not want to miss out on being a part of the IIM family and the huge network of the eminent B-schools. A few movies on the weekends are nothing in front of what the other side of the table has to offer to you. Trust me, if you show dedication, you would not regret it. Ever.Hope this helps.All the best!","This one pic brings back 1000 memories for me and accurately describes my dedication during that period.This is me revising QA on a construction site in North Africa during lunch break (With my helmet in the background).The Story - Location - Oran, Algeria (About 8000 km from India)I was working as a Construction Engineer in Algeria in 2015 when I first decided to write CAT. Now, as some of you might know, the work of an On-Field Construction Engineer is pretty extreme both mentally and physically. For me, it used to be about 12 hours a day, 6 days a week and that too on-the-site itself.I started my preparation on May 21, 2015, totally clueless about CAT. But once I decided to write it, I ensured to give at least 2–3 hours every day. EVERY SINGLE DAY. (Except for a few days before flying back to India to write CAT). Initially, it was so damn difficult as I used to be super-tired after the field work but not for a single day did I not study. I was starting from scratch, and I had to go ALL IN. I had to leave no stone unturned. It really was NOW OR NEVER for me.It was all the more challenging as this was going to be my first CAT attempt and I had no books, notes or any other direct medium to study from. Most of my preparation was through reading articles online, Pagalguy threads, or mock tests. I also had some pretty amazing friends from Pagalguy with whom I used to discuss (Mohit Jain & Ganesh Nagarsekar were also among them).I would study in whatever way I can on my way to/from office (using Mobile/Notebook). During lunch, I would finish eating in 10 mins so that I can use the remaining 50 mins for studying (The above pic is me studying during my lunch break). Any free time I found during the day, be it for 15 mins, I would do something or the other that would help in some way. (Most of the time, using my mobile as I loaded it up with articles, bookmarks, and even mock test papers that I have already written but the analysis was remaining).[I preferred to study on the site instead of the office as the breeze used to be amazing. This pic below shows my under-construction site and the above pic was while I was sitting inside one of these floors. You can see the Mediterranean Sea in the background!]Now that I think about those days, I may as well say that I might have been possessed and was pretty crazy at times!Heck, I wrote a full mock test on my 6-hour long flight from Algiers to Dubai and ended up analyzing it as well! (This was about 14 days before CAT when I was flying back to India)These 6 months & 7 days were the most amazing days of my life as I can confidently say that I gave all I had in me during this period.The result day… well that’s a story for another time :-)never_settle"
CAT Exam,"Even after 92 percentile in my first CAT attempt, I failed to convert any good colleges. What could I do to avoid this fiasco the next year?",https://www.quora.com//Even-after-92-percentile-in-my-first-CAT-attempt-I-failed-to-convert-any-good-colleges-What-could-I-do-to-avoid-this-fiasco-the-next-year,"Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",6,"For converting any of the top 10 colleges the safest percentile is 99+. You may convert it at less but the safest is 99+.Now coming to my experience, I started preparing for CAT in 3rd year of my engineering, but I was never serious so I ended up missing a lot of classes and was very irregular. Ended up scoring less. Decided to give CAT another attempt and this time promised myself to be serious about it.After my engineering, I didn't take up a corporate job (had an offer). Instead I started working with my father in our family business and was preparing for CAT alongside.I will share my daily routine with you:I used to go to work at 10am and return by 5pm or 6pm.After that from around 7 or 8 I used to start studying till 1 or 2 am.I used to give one section test of RC consisting 3 RC passages daily. This was mainly because I was weakest in VA-RC. I used to analysed the RCs and then start with QA and DI/LR on alternate days. I am a moody person so used to study chapters based on my mood. On days when I was too tired I used to solve easy chapters.For vocabulary, in the initial firsts month I started doing 1 or 2 sessions of word power made easy by Norman Lewis and completed it.I used to give mocks mainly on weekends. Most of my weekends were spent mainly on giving a mock followed by analysing a mock.My mock analysis would give me all the chapters which I need to study in the coming week.I also followed blogs of CATking CAT Blogs and GP ka funda.You can check this study plan : CAT Study Plan It is very comprehensive and nice.You can also follow this youtube channel for more tips :Rahul CATKing Youtube ChannelLastly, I would say consistency is must!This all worked for me. Hope you benefit from some of it too!","Thanks for A2A RohitHi students!I remember a BE senior of mine could not convert any IIM after getting approx 99.7 in CAT long back in 2007. Perhaps he did not have the right confidence and frame of mind going into the BLACKI PI rooms. Last year a student of mine could not convert any IIM despite scoring 98.5+ in CAT. So, first thing first - it happens. Now, the reason behind this is lack of the right mentorship or exposure. Understand exposure and guidance come to those who seek. So, here goes my suggestion for next year:Try scoring >92 in CAT. 92 is a very tricky score for the range of colleges that call at that score. IMI, IMT, IRMA,MDI etc. etc. all get most students in the range 88–95. To be on the safer side, try getting 95+. That makes things easier for you.Now, coming to the profile part. Make sure your resume looks a clear picture of who you are. Create buckets of whatever achievements you have got till now. Note down the positions of responsibilities that you have held till now. Prepare your projects and subjects well and go into the PI round as an informed and sorted individual who knows all that he has done in life till now.Be clear on why do you want your hand to fit in the glove. Lots of students miss the bus because they are not able to link their profile to the college and or stream that they are applying for. Read blogs, sites related to management and build a clear perspective on why MBA and why you think you are good for pursuing MBA? CAT score is not the answer for this - interest in exam itself is also not enough - interest in management has to developed. Your MBA personality has to be nourished right from now. So read, follow and enjoy management stuff in life right from now. Believe that you belong!Believe in yourself. Last time was an experience, this time will be performance! Bounce back with 100% confidence. You will do it then.Best wishesRahul SirCAT Prep with IIM A alumni","To be honest it is not all that surprising that one isn’t able to convert a decent B-school through CAT at 92 percentile.To get calls from the older IIMs (ABCLIK) a percentile around/above 99.xx along with having a strong academic history is required. For the 2nd generation IIMs, a percentile above 97 percentile with decent profile shall fetch you calls. For 3rd gen. IIMs (baby IIMs), with a good overall profile you may get calls if you are anywhere above 95 percentile in CAT.So, what can you do to avoid this fiasco?Well, a lot. Start with preparing a study plan for yourself and follow it religiously. Initially brush up on all the basic concepts before moving on to the sectional or full course MockCATs. If you think you are in need of external help, join a coaching institute as soon as possible.Once you are done with the basics, you may take sectional or topic based tests. As you get accustomed to these sectional tests, move towards full course mock CATs. Analyze the results of these mock CATs in depth, to identify your strengths and weaknesses to work on them.Start reading novels, newspaper editorials and business magazines to improve on your vocabulary and reading skills.As most B-schools also give certain amount of weightage to your profile including academic history and work-ex you might want to try and get a job. Having work-ex on your CV will not only provide you the additional points which are allotted for work-ex but will also give you topics and experiences from job to discuss with the interviewer.You might also find this answer of mine helpful: Siddharth Ganthade's answer to What should be my daily routine if I want to crack the CAT 2018?Hope this helps.All the best.","Thanks for A2A!As you must have realised by now scoring high in CAT does not guarantee a seat in good B-schools. There are 2 things you can do now to increase your chances of getting selected:1.Improve your CAT score to score more in that component of the selection criteriaThis can be done as follows:Preparing in a structured way is what is required! I used the following approach in my prep days which worked wonders for me:Give 3–4 mocks in a proper timed mannerAnalyse all of them togetherSo analyse all the VA sections together, QA sections together and DILR sections togetherTry to see where you are continuously going wrong or missing out in each of the sectionsThose are your weak areas! Work on them in the following way:Go to the concept files/lessons, learn the conceptLearn how to apply themPractise, Practise and Practise until you have covered all the varieties of questions and are confident about the topic2–3 weeks should be good enough for each of the topics if you give 1/2 hour - 1 hour of time to these weak areas a day for each of the sectionsPost you are done with the weaknesses you can start off with your strengths - only they will take you lesser time and effortLater on post 3–4 months you should be over topic wise preps and can start off with mocks which will further solidify your confidence. However, if you do miss out on any question due to not being able to apply the concept you should go back and go through it again!2.

You'll be lucky to get a call.I'm one of the GEMs in the list above.Aim for XAT/GMAT/MDI or max FMS via CAT if your acads are bad.I can only imagine how the others in the list must be feeling right now. It hurts because CAT exam have so many tuitions and mock series and what not crap. It's so overhyped that people forget that it's just a filtering criteria(you're just a number on the excel sheet bro) and nobody cares once you get a call(apart from XLRI MDI FMS). I and the others might not have been as good as we could've been,but I'm cent percent sure we didn't do that bad to be waitlisted in 200s or be direct rejects.It's just effort down the drain. I'm not trying to be a spoilsport but just giving you the truth- truth that nobody told me. Truth that these so called experts with 20+ years of experience in the industry don't tell you because they know if they tell you that you have a slim chance of a call even with 99.8+ you'll never join since it'll become too much of a gamble. Greed at its very best. Seriously you guys,the hell?The argument that “if you know that you can't get a call with a high percentile will you stop studying? No right?” Is the shittiest argument I've ever heard. 99.8+ requires efforts and thorough mock analyses,at least for regular people. I'm not one of those brilliant people who study 1 hour a day for 2 months and crack CAT. So yes, I for one probably wouldn't have if I knew I needed 99.95 for an Ahmedabad call and that even a 100 wouldn't have gotten me a Bangalore call. I would've used my energy and time somewhere else productively.TL;DR NO.I wish I could see recordings of converts and rejects and compare. Feel like absolute crap.Rant over.PS: Funny story- 93%ile SC-E-M - Converted ABC. Go figure.","No.We Indian students are a terribly hardworking breed. Once put our minds to anything, it doesn’t stand a chance. Look at the ever increasing scores in all exams across the world. All conquered. So when someone starts to feel bugged by their engineering coursework(majority aspirants) and having a knack for cracking exams, they get to know about CAT. Another MCQ based paper that delights the best of us given its nature and the level it is tested on. True feline.You enroll, prepare, appear, ace and end up with a number. That number is just to get a call. It does not even appear in the interview application form(so the panel does not know if you are a 100%iler or a 98-only in ABC). Also, you can’t write it in your CV once inside IIM.What remains? Interview, Written Test(called WAT/AWT) and maybe GD. So CAT isn’t the actual D-Day, your interview day is.People say that there is some weightage for CAT as well in the final selection. It’s usually 30%. Without even normalising(as some institutes might do and which you must know reduces the difference of scores further), let’s just say they divide your CAT score by 10. So if you got 220/300 in CAT, you get 22/30 in final composite score. Makes sense?Look at the other side of the picture now.220 was 99.98%ile this year.100% was 230+99% was ~17299.6% was ~185(close to AC cutoffs)Now calculate their weightage individually.100%ile→23+/30(Mind you, only 20 people across the country, highest being 27.5)99.98%ile→22/3099.6%ile→18.5/3099%ile→17.2/30See what the difference between a 100 and a 99(a difference of 2000 ranks btw) amounts to in the final score? Barely 6 marks. Reduces to 4 if you are 99.95.Point being-CAT does not guarantee anything. In the anonymous answer below, I personally know many people in that list being one myself.I was curious as to why such high CAT score couldn’t fetch a IIM-B call. Here’s what the RTI says.Note the weightages for each component:CAT-40, X-20, XII-10, UG-20, Workex-8, Diversity-2My scores:X-94.43(661/700)[ICSE], XII-93.6(468/500)[ISC], UG-70.4%, CAT-99.98(219.81/300), Workex-0So it’s not that you need to have “poor” acads to not even get a call. I was the district topper in 10/12 and an average(not poor) lad in UG. But no call still. Learn this-they seek impeccable, not good. Outliers do exist though.This answer is absolutely not intended to demotivate anyone. I knew about these facts from the start and yet gave it a shot. But many people remain oblivious of the reality. It’s better to know the consequences before building castles in your mind. Some motivation? For same number of people getting rejected, there are a few getting selected as well. But then there are those courageous souls who, even after getting 99.9+ retake CAT multiple times to get in just ABC(in a few cases, just A). So it all depends on your risk taking ability. Just keep a fair idea of where you might land up. I for one always knew about no B call. And was comfortable joining any of ABCLKI(though later mind started to think about retaking CAT). But then realised that having made through once doesn’t mean I could get a call always(tremendous luck needed). So accepted my place in the normal distribution curve.Goodluck!","The answer to this question is no. The most important thing to get an admission in a B-school is how much do you score in CAT, and not how much did you prepare.Even if you crack the CAT, your admission would depend a lot upon the college which you seek an admission into.For a lot if colleges, yes, you can get an admission as soon as you have crossed a particular percentile score in CAT (assuming that you have applied/will apply for that institute) and have higher percentile than the cut-off for the institute for that year.For most (almost all) of the tier-1 B-schools in India, the answer to, if you will get an admission even if you have a high CAT percentile, is “NO” . In fact, cracking the CAT is just half the journey covered.Most of the top B-schools, give individuals calls for the further rounds based on their past academic scores, work-experience and CAT score (gender and academic diversity play a role in getting calls too). Once one has received a call, s/he has to undergo one or more of the following process rounds:WAT (Written Ability Test),GD ( Group Discussions), andPersonal InterviewThe weightage allotted to these rounds for most of the top B-schools is very high. For some institutes it is as high as the CAT score and in some cases even more than the CAT score. Hence, performing equally well in all of these rounds is as important as performing well in the CAT. A final composite score is then calculated separately for every individual and based on the occupancy of the college for that year, final admission are given.To learn more about the WAT, GD and PI rounds conducted across institutes and how to excel at them, I recommend you to watch the video linked. CAT WAT, GD, PI video.Hope this helps.All the best.","Thanks for the A2A Rounak.It depends on the company you are sitting for. Ideally for mass recruiters like CTS, TCS, Infosys etc,CAT prep is more than enough. Generally you can get through the apti round pretty easy, the problem is with the technical interview.So in case you have a good enough preparation for CAT, don't think about the Aptitude round and rather concentrate on the coding skills.:)"
CAT Exam,How should I prepare for CAT 2018 if I am starting from now?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-prepare-for-CAT-2018-if-I-am-starting-from-now,"CAT 2018 Aspirant, CSE 2018 Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",100+,"Strategy for CAT preparation could vary significantly from person to person depending on your current abilities and in general, there is no one size fits all strategy that you could refer to. In this answer I will try to write a comprehensive guide assuming an average initial level in all the 3 sections namely VA, DI-LR & QAQuantitative Ability:Probably the favorite section for engineers. A big chunk of CAT aspirants tend to overestimate their skills in this section (including myself in my first attempt when my percentile turned out to be lowest in QA among the 3 sections). Preparation of Quant largely involves two parts, concept and speedConcept:Focus on building your fundamentals first. Solve basic questions from all the topics that you struggle in, don’t time your attempts initially, what matters now is learning and accuracy. Make sure to not leave out any topic, people generally tend to leave out numbers or geometry and put all their time in solving algebra problems or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your prep. Remember to get an access of 99+ percentile in Quant, you need to solve around 28/34 questions (based on recent CAT papers) and leaving out entire topics would not help your cause.Material: Any good textbook or coaching class material should be enough for studying fundamentals. You can also checkout few good Youtube channels.You should ideally be done with the fundamentals of all the topics by July 31st, latest by 10th of August.Speed:Once you have a good grasp on the fundamentals, you can work on building up your speed. Here’s where it gets tricky, simply mugging up tables, ratios, squares and cubes would do little good. The idea is to be able to develop the skill to solve a question without using old school methods.This could involve solving questions using option elimination, rough estimation, logical guesswork etc.But then how do you develop this skill. The answer, as trivial or stupid as it may sound is that you need to stop solving questions using the straight forward, lengthy original methods. Instead, try to solve it using a different, shorter method, try using the options, if the options are numerically far apart try to estimate the range of the answer, just avoid old school!!! (Can’t stress this enough)You can find good examples of how this could be done in the link below:Getting better at CAT QuantBased on observation, for developing speed, questions that are present online (based on your test series) tend to be better than questions in standard textbooksResult: You will notice that you might not be able to find a shortcut in roughly 80% of the questions. But the skill you develop and the amount of time it will save on the remaining 20% will make a huge difference. To illustrate, you will be able to solve around 7 questions in under 45 seconds each as opposed to the average 1.8 to 2 minutes. This gives you roughly 8 to 9 minutes extra in the paper, which could be the difference between a 97 percentile and a 99.5 percentile in Quant.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:A high initial ability is a big plus in this section. But even if you are not very good at verbal in your current stage of preparation, significant improvements can be made that can potentially take you beyond the 99 percentile mark in VA-RCFirst and foremost, if your current level in VA-RC is average you need to solve atleast one Reading Comprehension set every single day. There are no shortcuts here. This worked wonders for me. There are two things you need to focus on while you solve RCs viz. Reading speed and thought flow of the author. I stress on reading speed because it is essential that you are atleast able to read and give a fair attempt to all 34 questions. That’s not going to happen if you take 9 minutes to read an RC.Analyse each RC that you solve. Gradually time your attempts. Every time you read, try and step into the author’s shoes , try to comprehend the reason behind why the article was written in the first place. This will help you tons in those tricky summary and tone of the passage questions. Do not mark options haphazardly, read each answer option carefully, compare it to the context and your understanding of the passage and then attempt. Do not take accuracy for granted. High accuracy does wonders in the VA sections and for that matter all the 3 sections.If you are facing problems in understanding passages and see yourself getting direct questions wrong, then it might be a good idea to go back to basics, invest time there.Moving from direct questions to inference based questions, this is a bit tricky and it’s slightly hard to directly write a guide for this but remember the trick is to be able to see the passage as a logical flow of ideas and not a discrete collection of sentences. When you are able to connect each passage with the next and are able to draw out a logical story where the sum is greater than the parts, you should be able to do fairly well in Inference based questions. So focus on understanding each idea in the passage and how they connect to each other.Be patient, do not lose heart if you don’t see improvements in 5–6 days. You will notice significant difference in a month but stick to the 1+ RC a day formula. You will notice you are able to read faster which will save considerable time.Moving on to Verbal Ability,Again this is a section where improvement takes time, there is no easy way. Tracking your improvement could be even more challenging, since the improvements are gradual.So like every other section, continous practice is the way to go. Spend some time in understanding solutions for questions that you do not get right in the first go. Analysing these questions will significantly boost your skills in VA over time.You can follow the points below for different types of questions in VASummary type questions: Mark 3–4 important points or take-aways in the passage, check all the options for the one which has the most points present from what you have markedOdd-one out: First identify atleast two sentences that would be part of the passages, some sentences would obviously form a pair. See what the common theme is, check if the theme is not present in any of the options or if any of the options cannot not precede or succeed or fit between the pair you have selected, that should be your answer (Obviously, easier said than done)Para-jumbles: Absence of answer options can make these types of questions very tricky. As mentioned in the previous type, start with identifying any of the following if apparent: mandatory pair, obvious opening statement, obvious concluding statement. Build the connect from there onData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:Seeing the difficulty level of this section for the past 3 years, it’s now probably the make or break section in CAT. If you have taken past CATs or seen the questions, you will know what I am talking about.The good part is most people fail to do well in this section not because they are not prepared but either because their strategy is flawed or because they panic on D-day.I will come to the exam strategy part for all the 3 sections later in this answer, let’s first cover how you should prepare for DI-LR.One DI and one LR set every single day (if your current level is average then this is a must do). Do not directly start with practicing CAT level sets, start with basic questions. Once you are comfortable with that, move on to the intermediate level questions. After a few weeks of practice do a few easy sets again and see if you are able to solve them in under 5 mins. That’s the real trick to acing the DI-LR section. It’s not about how hard problems you are able to solve but more about how fast can you solve the easy level questions so that you can devote a fair amount of time to doing the medium level sets on D-Day.Solve all the standard type of sets including arrangements, tournaments, blood relations type questions in LR though there is close to 0% chance that any of these would come in the actual CAT, they will help you build your reasoning skills. Now when you move to the not so standard types, the way you approach them is try to map out a path in your mind that goes from what is given to what you need to find. Sounds vague but trust me it will help. You will get better at it with practice.In DI as mentioned in the QA part , have a strong grip on ratios and percentages. Fast calculations will help you do the direct questions (quite rare these days) quickly. For the non-direct ones, well again it will only come with practice. But the general approach is the same as mentioned, try to map out a way from given to what is to be found.All in all, probably the most important take away for this section is practice, practice and more practice.Bonus: The CAT Writer this blog helped me a lot during my preparation. Make sure you go through all the relevant articles in itCAT-holics This blog covers almost all Quant topics with solved problems. The questions covered in it are better (utility-wise) than what you will find in most books. Certainly a must do!Few general points:Do not panic at any point during the exam, remember, if you find the paper difficult, others are probably feeling the same. So, focus on getting max questions rightSimilarly, do not get carried away if you think the paper is easy. The worst thing you can do is get complacent mid-examYour preparation should ideally peak in September through mid October, do not exhaust yourself in the last two weeks before the test, it will do you no goodMake sure you subscribe to atleast 2 good test series, do not miss tests and analyse all the tests that you give, attempting alone without doing a post result analyses is practically uselessLastly, CAT could be a dicey exam. Do not lose heart if you are not able to do well because of some reason. It's not the end of the worldI will keep editing the answer as and when I remember more pointsFor strategy on how to attempt the CAT on D-Day you can refer to Gautam Oswal's answer to What could be the best strategy for attempting CAT paper?All the Best!Special credits: Tony Xavier","A quick intro to my credentials:VARC: 79.94(99.63 percentile)LR-DI: 40.62(98.14 percentile)QA: 73.76 (98.95 percentile)Overall scaled score 194.32 (99.74 percentile)I'll try to answer assuming you have only a little knowledge of QA, LRDI , VARC. First of all, and this is very important, you should know the reason why you are attempting the CAT. Why I am saying this is that most people don't know what they are doing and why are they doing so. It is necessary to know your reason and use it to work hard.There are a lot of education institutes that help students prepare for CAT, but I would recommend TIME because their classroom programme has really helped me step up my game. In addition to that TIME’s study material covers basics very well. A very important thing here is to give AIMCATs or mock CATs to understand where are you lagging, what kind of mistakes are you making, how to remedy those mistakes, which areas to skip(do not think one too early), how can you improve your accuracy , uniqueness of these questions - repetitive or new concepts or a new dressing on the same concept. This will also help you know your forte which instills a new confidence(helpful many a times…lol). Take a note of your mental state too. Jot down these things in a diary or keep them in mind.Now let us delve into the specific subjects:VARC:Read newspapers: Make it a habit to read Economic Times daily or Business Standard. I would recommend Economic Times because it provides with a wide range of news from diverse topics. Use this to improve your reading speed (focus on accuracy not on speed), comprehension and to build up a good vocabulary. You'll learn some phrasal verbs, some idioms(not needed in cat, useful anyhow) and it also helps with grammar.Wren and Martin High School English Grammar and Composition: This book has been put together specially for Indian Subcontinent. It provides ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension and other allied areas to improve English communication.Tata McGraw Hill How to prepare for VARC by Arun Sharma: An awesome book. I‘ll admit it is tough, but it helps immensely.Merriam Webster App: Play the vocabulary game. It’s addictive, fun and helping.Read books : This has been suggested invariably by all my English teachers to improve comprehension and build vocabulary but i emphasize on it because it improves medium term memory(little eroded by RCs). Not necessary though!LR-DI: I attended my classes regularly and gave mocks. I sometimes used Arun Sharma’s books 1 and 2. It is sufficient. My LR-DI section was pretty weak, but these things helped me score decently.QA: QA was my forte. But a dry spell in QA was all that was needed to trim my overconfidence. Again, I used Arun Sharma Sir’s books and have to say I was surprised at my ignorance. The tips and tricks that sir has mentioned not only improved my efficiency but also my speed.Last things last, prepare well for CAT. Focus on knowledge. Use poor results as motivation. Use mediocre results as motivation. Use good results as motivation. Maintain a healthy mental state. Take some breaks regularly. Thanks to my friends,I could keep calm. I would get anxious or stuck in self-doubt and they’d help me to regain energy. Maintain a good physical health. 30–60 minutes of brisk walking is enough. And don’t beat up yourself for anything, just try to move past it(take the lesson ans use it wisely).Disclaimer: I did all the things above, but not even to 25% levels. So keep calm and prosper.","First of all find out each and every information related to CAT, likeOpportunities after CATNo of students present in examLast year exam analysis ( At how many number, how much percentile occur)SyllabusPaper LevelMake your percentile goalAfter seen all the information then make a strategy.

CAT Exam,Why should one prepare for CAT? ,https://www.quora.com//Why-should-one-prepare-for-CAT,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",13,"Going anonymous, since I don’t want my office colleagues know that I am preparing for CAT.This is my CAT story. I gave CAT 2017 and scored 99.48%ile. Thanks to my General Engineering Male status didn’t get a call from ABCLI. Also , I could not convert my IIM-Kozhikode and FMS calls. Am I dejected? Hell yeah. Will I try again? Hell Yeah.I am giving CAT ’18 full aware that I need 99.98%ile at least, to get a call from IIM-A due to my low graduation scores. I know for the fact, that I might not get a call from IIM-B even after scoring 100%ile.At this point I want to say that I work in a reputed product company with a handsome package and a very good work life balance.So what drives me to work even hard to prepare for this exam. Plenty of reasons actually.An MBA from an IIM opens up a whole new window of opportunities ranging from Strategy Consulting to Investment Banking to Marketing. This is a big break away for me from moving from 1 technology stack to another. An MBA thereby opens up a lot of industry verticals.The 2 years of management education instills in an individual the rigour, versatility and persistence to survive in the management world. The most important take away we get from the top IIMs is time management. Loads of assignments with inflexible deadlines forces an individual to prioritize and manage time.2 years of corporate experience has made me aware of the importance of networking. Imagine being in a group of 400 top minds across the country, from different background and different experience level. This combined with the fact that the best management teachers would be teaching you. This makes striving to get into an IIM worthwhile.How do I know all this. online student experiences and interaction with my friends who are in IIM has helped me understand the importance of the top IIMs.Hope to make the cut in CAT 2018. :)Any suggestions are welcomeEDIT: Thanks for your comments. Sorry, could not reply earlier. Got busy in some other things.Some of you wanted to know my acads: 10th - 92%, 12th - 81.5% and BTech: 73%Kushagra Sahai : If you are in your 2nd year, the most valuable thing that you can do is improve upon you academics. It carries a lot of weight when IIMs roll out the calls.Pranav Ingale I would not say that they are not good. But to leave a high paying product company for new IIMs could not be justified.Logging off quora until CAT 2018. Hope I can remove my anonymity after CAT ’18 ;)","That is how life is.I scored a 100 %ile in 2010, and yet did not get a call from IIM-Indore. Upon inquiring, they told me that as per their criteria, I did not make it to the top 1600 candidates who were selected for interviews.I have 90+ in both 10th and 12th, and a 7+ GPA. Nothing stellar, but nothing really bad too. Moral of the story: The shortlisting and selection criteria isn't that straightforward.It is common sense that someone would look at and evaluate the eligibility criteria for interviews before even preparing. It might so happen that some institute has some criteria that you already don't satisfy. All of the same are available on the institute websites.This is precisely why I advise folks to not quit their jobs to prepare for CAT or have a backup career plan (for freshers). P.S. Below are the links for the eligibility and selection criteria for the 19 IIMs. They are updated every year for the next year's process. Any prospective CAT aspirant must ensure that they go through the eligibility criteria for that year, and satisfy at least some of them.The first 7Admission Details - IIMA Indian Institute of Management Bangalore Admissions | IIMC Eligibility : : IIML Announcement - IIMK Academic Programmes - भारतीय प्रबंध संस्थान इंदौर - IIM Indore Post-Graduate Programme (PGP) Admissions at IIM Shillong The next 6 (started on or after 2010)IIM Rohtak "" AdmissionIIM Ranchi - PGDM 2016 (Criteria) IIM Raipur IIM Trichy - PGPM Admission Criteria IIM Udaipur - Post Graduate Programme | Programs | Home IIM Kashipur The final 6 (started in 2015)IIM NAGPUR IIM BodhgayaIIM-Visakhapatnam IIM Amritsar IIM Sirmaur IIM Sambalpur - भारतीय प्रबंध संस्थान इंदौर - IIM Indore","Before we start talking abut the %iles, preparation strategies & all the stuff, let's start by the paper itself!Common Admission Test (CAT)Computer Based TestTime: 180mins (60mins each for all 3 sections)Questions: 100(VA-34; LRDI-32; QA-34)Sections: Verbal & Reading Comprehension (VRC); Logical Reasoning & Data Interpretation (LRDI); Quantitative Ability (QA)All specific details as per CAT 2015 & are subject to change in future!## In general exam is conducted in the last week of November, on yearly basis!PREPARATIONWell, that depends on how you want to tackle it!Either you can enroll yourself to any classroom program or you can do self study & join any online mock series next year.In case you tag plan to along second choice, this is what you can do:Enroll to Career Launcher  & Takshzila shikshak  on YouTube!If you can devote yourself to a classroom program later on, I'll suggest you to join Career Launcher, as the mentors there will work there ass off to assist & facilitate you.Meanwhile buy any good relevant topics related books (Arun Sharma for Verbal, Quant & LRDI) n target 1 topic each every day!Also as you plan to start your prep form Feb-March, these are few things that can help you:Read a loads of good book from different areas/genres. This will make you well-read that comes handy given the number of RC questions CAT gives now. For the same please refer to this link containing this answer already shared. Himanshu Aggarwal's answer to What is the best book for verbal ability for the CAT?Give more attention to basics rather than just learning the techniques for particular question types.Do atleast 1 set of LR & DI each on regular basis! Believe me save you from a lot of trouble in later stages.Read a good news paper to be familiar of what's going around. This will also be helpful in building a good vocab while improving your GK which is asked in other exams..(XAT as well..!\m/)If possible, start watching to different Youtube videos for analysis of prev exam papers. This will give a good insight of what happened with those who appeared in earlier years.I hope you'll be able to get most out of your preparation.All the best!","The answer is quite Simple. Another question: Why MBA?If you are anywhere close to completing your graduation or have worked in the industry for a few years and are thinking what to do next then MBA from one of the top B-schools in India would definitely have crossed your mind. So, let us cut the chase and come straight to the point. We will talk about 5 reasons why you should do an MBA and 5 reasons why people tend to be afraid of preparing for an MBA:MBA for financial Independence:We hear about the Rs. 1 crore plus salary packages that students from the IIMs get every year. Even beyond those, one can expect a package of 10-20 lakhs post an MBA from one of the top-25 B-schools in India. And mind you, these numbers are for a fresh out of B-school graduate. With a few years of work-experience the salary levels would only go higher. So, for even an average engineering graduate, MBA offers at least a 3 fold jump over his pre-MBA salary levels.MBA for growth in Career:Those of us who have worked for a few years will agree that to grow beyond a certain level in your job, you need an additional degree. Also, even as a fresh graduate you can reasonably expect a saving of 2-3 years in reaching the project manager level of profiles.MBA for greater Job options:The sheer diversity of jobs, the extent of responsibility and ownership that you get as an MBA in your job make it worth your while. You get to choose from a range of specialisations such as Marketing, Advertising, Finance, Strategy, Consulting etc. The challenges that you have as an MBA are much higher and so are the rewards for success.MBA for Job Security:If you recall the slew of recessions that have hit our country over the past 10 years and how vulnerable every job becomes, it'd help to also remember that your job as an MBA is one of the safest ones as the senior resources are relatively difficult to hire and fire.MBA for Social respect, Networking and Credibility:If you want to become an entrepreneur you will need experience in the sector of preference, and financial backing besides others. Your ability to get seed capital for starting a new business improves tremendously if you have done an MBA from one of the top B-schools in the country. You also get to interact with the best minds in the country where you can brainstorm your ideas and get a better handle on things.Ask yourself, who'd you like to be – one-in-a-hundred graduates working for a company or the one who is overseeing their performance. Let is be said that an MBA definitely provides better recognition, opportunities to network and credibility too.And if you want to do MBA from reputed institute then you will have to prepare for CAT as most of these colleges do consider CAT. Even if you don’t want to apply to IIMs then also you may have to appear for an institute specific exam and it will require a CAT level preparation."
CAT Exam,How was your CAT 2018 paper?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-your-CAT-2018-paper,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",13,"I wrote cat for the third time in a row. I had admission offers from new and baby iims but I decided to give it one more shot. The biggest blunder I had done was to leave my job. And before you read any further let me advice you not to do the same, no matter what. So, my exam was in slot 2. The day earlier I watched friends and andaz apna apna to cool down. I had given around 35 mocks, so I was pretty confident that I'm gonna nail it.On the exam day the biometric and every thing went smooth.Then starts the exam. Varc has not been my favorite, but I went there with a mindset just to clear the cutoffs. In cat 2016 I failed to clear sectional in this and had paid the price. To my surprise VA seemed pretty easy. Rc were readable but had few tricky questions with closer options. I managed to mark 24 somehow. God knows at what accuracy. I was relieved after this section as the nightmare I thought was over.Dilr is something I enjoy. I love solving puzzles. I was prepared for a tough section but to my surprise there were 2 extremely easy sets which everyone must have attempted. I cracked 4 sets in about 50 min. But got carried away while solving 5th one. And the section got locked.Qa is my forte. I've scored 99pc in qa for 2016&17 cat. And as all the IIMs were boasting about diversity and all, nearly every mock from every institute had easy qa section. Maybe that's why people are crying alot over qa. I went through the paper to find that the section is difficult. I started with round strategy but not many were lower hanging fruits. Also, the problems and calculations as well, were lengthy and took time. I managed to solve 21 questions here.Overall, I enjoyed the paper. I didn't feel as much heat as people are shouting and crying. It was a pretty decent paper. All the papers in 2002–2008 were far far difficult than this one.People got to remember one thing, if it was hard for you it will be same for everyone. In this case lower attempts could fetch you great percentile. What matters the most in this case is the accuracy.Cat 2016- 95pcCat 2017–96.9 pcEdit; Those asking aboout leaving job-yes its extremely difficult to manage prep with job in hand. but believe me when you go for an interview, they grill you based on the same. there will be many with great profiles + job experience. So, the panel will ask you if they did manage to, what was the problem in your case? until and unless you have a stellar profile or very strong reason i recommend not doing so. Maybe you can find a job where you dont have to devote full attention for the whole day.About QA- Cause I'm a mechanical engineer, and this is what we do! I mean, we may be not great readers, don't read a lot, or run very fast... but damn it, we can crunch numbers and solve QA.","My exam was in slot 1.First let me give a brief about my profile:10th | 12th | Graduation - 96% | 89.3% | GPA - 7.3Work experience - 3 years.CAT 2017 - 84.5 %ile.Now, My CAT 2018 attempts are :VARC(28), LRDI(20), QA(18)I was quite confident before the exam as i knew that i was well prepared for the exam. I had taken about 30 full length mock tests that helped me a lot to manage the time and make a guess about the difficulty level of questions.All thanx to my mock test practice, I made it a habit to spend first 5 minutes in analyzing the questions and determining the order in which i would attempt question.VARCRC were based on common topics like second world war, Consumer behavior etc. So, I didnt find any much difficulty in understanding the context of the passage. Strikingly i found the passages to be or shorter length( I was expecting long passages and had practiced alot). As the usual trend of CAT, most of the questions were based on inferences and had confusingly similar options but I was well taught the tricks to handle these question by my mentors. So, after a bit brainstorming I used to get to the correct answer.I did plastic pollution passage at first as I found it relatively easy followed by passages on world war and then consumer behavior.Verbal portion was very similar to last years paper. I didn’t find much in verbal portion worthy of talking.Overall, VARC was confusing but of moderate difficulty level.LRDILRDI portion is generally considered the toughest part of CAT exam and It proved to be the one. Even after determining the sequence in which i would attempt the section, i was stuck in the very first LR. I spend about 12 minutes there but the good part was i somehow managed to find the answers to all the questions.Overall, LRDI portion was Difficult. I talked to a lot of people at my center and most of them had attempted 15 or less.QuantsI personally felt geometry was the toughest part of QA section. IIMC maintained its legacy of setting the worst QA paper.There were a lot of NON-MCQ questions. Despite that the difficulty level of the section was touching heights. I felt the QA section was filled with Arithmetic questions. So, It became a bit lengthy also.Overall, Quants section came as a surprise to those who don’t know the trend of IIMC. We were warned about this by our mentors. So, we were on the safe side.I checked my response sheet with the answer key released by various institutes. My wrong attempts are:VARC - 2(Negative marking Ques) + 2( Non - negative/TITA)LRDI- 1(Negative Marking)Quants- 1 (TITA)These are my wrong attempts.After doing the required mathematics, I am getting 177 marks.For this score, I am quiet confident of getting 99+ percentile, rest depends on the level of competition.If you want to know about the my CAT journey and best coaching institutes for CAT visit my answer.Ayush Bhatnagar's answer to Which is the best MBA coaching institute in Delhi? How is it better than the other institutes?For any help, you can message me.Please upvote if this helps you.","100%ile aspirers can skip the answer.I gave up CAT preparation in august as I thought my preparation was going no where, my mock scores didn’t cross 100 marks and I seriously thought of giving GATE another chance. But I don’t think my giving up affected my CAT score phenomenally because of following reasons:VA/RC:I am pretty good at RC. I read books to my extent, so no problem in VARC I attempted 25 questions (Dunno about accuracy though) but I did my level best.DI/LR:The actual reason I gave up CAT because I thought DI/LR being tough and I got single digit marks and attempted questions in single digit only in mocks. So, I would not make it to 99%ile zone,so no IIM calls, so no MBA. So, I gave up and started preparing GATE but as I was in exam hall and solving sets, I had feeling that it didn’t have anything which needed stupendous amount of practice and solving all the difficult sets from mocks and books. Definitely tough section but key to success lies in finding easy sets and a medium set, so that you solve 12–16 questions correctly and you will be through. There will be no time to solve more questions than that and if somebody tells you he/she solved more than that it means they have affected their accuracy. Solve 15–18 questions with full accuracy and you will have 99%ile. I solved 13 questions.(Dunno about accuracy though). Easy sets will be time consuming.Bekar Ki Mehnat Mat KaroQuant:Definitely tough and was a very unpleasant surprise. CAT quants from 2015–17 was very easy. If you knew basic maths you could solve but this year quant had questions which needed practice (a lot of practice precisely) and if my giving up affected CAT score it was in this area. I knew after the exam that if I hadn’t given up I would have scored well. I attempted 11 questions(Dunno about accuracy though). Before attempting even one question 20 minutes elapsed and somebody was cutting onions near me because I had tears in my eyes during quant (They shouldn’t allow onions in exam hall)Thoughts for the CAT:CAT became my favorite exam as it tests intelligence rather than memory (Though You should remember few formula but it’s only few)There is no need of coaching. I took online coaching but it didn’t affect my performance.All you need for CAT exam is Arun Sharma’s book and nothing else. Please follow no other book especially for DI/LR.Certain amount of practice more than enough(2 hours per day for 5 months)Don’t give up on exam otherwise you will regret like me laterEnjoy your learning days without stressing too much and please don’t feed your mind with plethora of questions, sets and passages because if exam is tough then it will be tough for all and everybody is human like you and will work hard only as much as you are.( If you are working quite hard though)Before exam meditate by chanting OM.BANAT BANAT BAN JAI——LAHIRI MAHASAYA","Finally dream day is done …with lot of confusions, assumptions, unpredictabilty and what not.Cat 2018 slot 2 exam went like a meery round.To begin with ..1.The devil in the maskVERBAL:First ,the passages seem to be easy and not confusing. So for many the section may be easy and went peacefully. Almost everyone attempted more than 25/34.But here comes the twist…did u observe that there are lot of ambiguity and confusion while answering ,especially RC. There are 2 similar answers out of which one is correct. So don’t believe if people says this section is easy…to conclude your score in this section depends critically upon your accuracy not the number of attempts…which test takers will realize soon :)2.DILR:Verbal gave a feeling of peace ..but as you go into dilr it was a bit changing. Though it was easier than cat 2017 …still it is tough compared to other years. To my shock, there are no arrangement questions from LR, and the DI was not calculative intensive but a bit more data to interpret..means it will take more time than average to complete a set.3.Night mareQUANT:Is this even a fully solvable section..every question is mutli layered and damn time taking.R.I.P for quant 2018…i am sure it will be the toughest quant paper in cat history.So overall, for me verbal is more tricky than what people are analysing and the other sections are similar .But cat 2018 is tougher than cat 2017..I am expecting a score of 155 is enough for 99 percentile and 100–110 for 90 percentile."
CAT Exam,How should working people aiming to take the CAT manage their preparations with work?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-working-people-aiming-to-take-the-CAT-manage-their-preparations-with-work,"Working Professionals Preparing for CAT Exams, CAT Preparation, Exam Strategies, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"I graduated now from IIM B. I prepared for CAT while I was working. I used to leave from home by 9.30 - 10 times in morning and be back in home by 9 - 10 after dinner from work. Some days, I had to stay in office late. My work comes under the category of hectic ( mentally, not physically ). This is what I did for the written CAT exam. Spend one hour every day in the morning, going through the chapters (Apti, DI, LR). I had materials, and I went chapter by chapter some day and random questions some day. Ensured I solved 20 problems in the beginning and as I progressed the speed increased tremendously. In office, open a browser tab and go to Arts & Letters Daily . Ensured I read three articles each day before I leave office. I'm generally curious, so I would read some random things without any background. Helped a lot in RC. The Hindu, Business standard in browser tab in office. Read in between meetings, when I was distracted etc. But, utilize time in office. Along with wordweb. Everyday, walk for 20 minutes or so in the night leisurely and recite to myself all multiplication tables ( 1 to 20 )Squares of numbers, cubes of numbers Calculate % components for 1/2, 1/3 ... 1/15 Take 5 random numbers and compute their squares and cubes ( short cut ways ) I know the set of people who are preparing for CAT; we especially had a guy who is very motivated and he would provide us the problems that are challenging & we would spend time discussing quickly. Mostly casual chat types. In our office, it was appreciated to prepare for exams and hence this was easy. Weekends, I gave one mock test, either from home or test center. I would try to solve the problem after the exams ( the ones I was not able to find quick solutions for ) & see if there are options. This would be complete in the weekend itself. Overall, CAT is about being in touch with the basics. You can solve the paper if you are given twice the time. It is all about speed and accuracy. These will not come unless you are in regular touch. Allot small amounts of time every day and you will surely crack it. All the best for your CAT...!!! ","CAT is very difficult to handle with 9 to 6 job, but it has to be done. I started my CAT preparation after I completed 2 years at work and finally nailed it with 1.5 years of preparation. I have experienced how difficult it is to maintain work-life balance. Thus, preparing CAT along with work is next to impossible for many. Thus, it leads to two extreme steps. Either the aspirant leaves his job or he leaves his dream of an IIM tag.Leaving the job for CAT is too risky because of the unpredictability of the exam. If you are thinking of taking the other step, then this post is not for you. You may scroll down to read some other post.I am assuming the following conditions are satisfied to follow the steps mentioned in this post:1. Saturday & Sunday off. (Weekend off)2. Total time 12 hours outside the home. (Office + travel time + etc.)3. You have only one goal in your life and i.e. CAT.Some of you may get off on some other days or work unevenly on various days. So for the people whom the above assumptions are not valid. Please accommodate the schedule as per your ease.1. Treat each section equally: - Considering the increasing difficulty level of DI & LR with every passing year and high unpredictability of VA, do not live under the veil that you can cover one section with another. Focus on all the sections.2. Weekdays: - On weekdays allocate 6 (8-2 = 6) hrs. for studying (2 hrs. for each of the four sections mentioned below)(i) QA: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals/books. You can use any of the two mocks (IMS, Time).(ii) DI/LR: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. You can use any of the three mocks (IMS, CL, Time). Practice as many sets as you can.(iii) VA/RC: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. IMS mocks provides you the closest RC that you may get in CAT. You can practice from Time also but RC from Time is a bit lengthy and contains a bit easier question. The VA/RC section of last two years CAT was most similar to IMS mocks. You can use office time to practice old mocks, sectional, etc. (Given you utilize the time judiciously. Trust me, it is achievable.)(iv) Newspaper Reading (The Hindu Editorial): - This should be finished at the office. Do not carry this task to home. 9 to 6 job provides you enough free time to read the newspaper. If you do not get enough time during lunch or while traveling, then you can follow other alternatives. Copy the editorial/article and paste it in either XLSX or notepad and read it. This way you will be at your cubicle and can utilize your time well. Do this whenever you get free time. Don't restrict yourself to only newspaper and diversify your readings.3. Weekends/Holidays: - On weekends/ holidays allocate minimum 12.5 hrs. for studying.(i) 7.5 hrs. for studying (2.5 hrs. to each section).(ii) 3 hrs. for mock.(iii) 2 hrs. for mock analysis.4. Till August: - You should finish QA theory & formulas, all concepts of DI & LR and the basic understanding of different question types in VA & RC.5. September & October: -(i) You should only do revision and attempt mocks and sectionals.(ii) You Should give at least 2 mocks each weekend with their analysis. Do not miss any center-based mocks. Attempt them at the center to prepare yourself for the exam like scenarios. (It will make you feel comfortable on D day).6. Last month (November): -(i) 1 mock each day and along with its analysis.(ii) I would advise taking a month leave before CAT. If it is not possible then take at least 2 weeks off before the exam and give mocks at exactly the exam time.7. Meanwhile, take out time to pursue your hobbies. Keep in mind CAT is not the end, it is just the beginning of your DREAM.All the Best. Please feel free to ask any query in the comment section.To get answer of all other Query Please Join.Log into Facebook | Facebook","IT IS NOT AT ALL DIFFICULT. Period. Always keep this in mind.CAT is an exam for which you need not put in several hours of preparation daily for months. Your preparation and performance will depend A LOT on where you stand right now. If someone is comfortable with Maths, Reasoning and/or English already, the entire preparation will revolve more around developing speed and polishing the strategy with which one approaches the paper. However, CAT is not that easy either, it is not the paper that makes this exam tough but rather, the high amount of competition.Note that, the major constraint for us here is TIME. So, we’ll try and do these 2 things -Reduce investing time in unnecessary activities other than what’s really important.The time that we invest in CAT prep, it must have high RoI. (So, no reading newspapers, past papers, old mock tests etc)Keeping this in mind, these are some key points (in no specific order) which will help you in preparing for CAT alongside working -Get hold of study material from any institute and make sure that you go through at least QA and LR from start to end ASAP. This is extremely important.A very important thing (that most people don't do) is that every time you try and solve questions, do it with time limit. It will be much more effective if you get used to solving questions in time limit from day 1.Try and manage 3 hours at least on alternate days, this will be needed when you write mock tests on weekdays.Try and utilise your travel time to office for revision. Maintain a thick notebook with all the QA formulas/tricks and LR concepts/tricks and keep updating it with every mock/sectional test you give.Mental calculations are very important. Practice this all the time, even while working.Instead of investing time in novels/newspapers, invest that same amount of time in solving RC passages on various themes and topics (With a time limit of course). This way, you'll practice a lot of reading as well as you'll also practice spotting answers for questions.Take mock test very seriously, and its analysis even more seriously. Write a mock only if you’re sure that you can focus. Do not write a mock when you’re super tired or are sure that you’ll be disturbed in between. More importantly, focus a lot on the analysis part. Identify where you went wrong. Go through the solution of the test thoroughly and write all the new formulae/tricks mentioned in the ‘thick notebook’ mentioned above.Once you start mocks, maintain an excel sheet to keep track of questions in VA and QA topic wise. After every mock, during analysis, just fill this excel sheet.At the end, apply a formula that will give you details about % attempt (Attempt/Total*100) and % accuracy (Correct/Ateempt*100) topic wise. After 10-15 mocks, you'll be very clear about which topic you are attempting less, where your accuracy is pathetic etc etc. It will help you much more than you realise.DO NOT try to do too many things. Someone will try and do mocks, various books from Indian authors, even GMAT books, then lots of reading, then improve grammar with several grammar improvement books, then vocab improvement books, solving questions on Pagalguy, solving questions on various sites, various study materials etc etc etc. KEEP IT SIMPLE. Don't get caught up with all this. Don't ask for too many suggestions. Talk to a few good people, make a good plan that you feel will work for you and just do it.Maximise your efforts during the weekends, significantly reduce hanging out with friends, movies etc.STOP WASTING TIME.Trust me, it is not difficult at all. I too did it in my first CAT attempt. I had an extremely demanding on-field job as a construction engineer and was able to spare only 2-3 hours per day 6 days a week for the preparation. On Friday (Weekend in Algeria), I used to study for around 6-8 hours. As this was my first attempt, I had to start from scratch. Moreover, I didn’t have any books or materials with me to study from so I had to look for concepts and questions on the internet. All the best.NEVER SETTLE","Given the changing nature of CAT (which at a fundamental level has remained more or less the same) and the preparation required to 'crack' an exam of this kind, planning becomes extremely important in addition to the natural skillset.Considering you have taken CAT 2015, you are now aware of three things:1. Verbal preparation is not really prep prep but something that needs to be done over a long period2. Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation requires vast exposure to different kind of questions and logic(s)3. A simple formula based approach and sticking to level of difficulty 1-2-3 in Quant is good enoughAlso read: Prasad Sawant's answer to Does CAT 2015 Stands a benchmark for future test pattern?When you are taking a second attempt at a test like this, your preparation strategy is quite different from your first attempt strategy. First attempt is like learning how to swim. You flounder, you need help, your strokes are without finesse and you somehow manage to stay afloat. And unless you do that, you don't reach the next level. But once you have learned what's required, you become better. Then you focus on cutting the water at a certain angle, perfecting your strokes, increase your lung capacity and strength, and finally, you become a good swimmer.Coming back to your question, let's start planning your day:Work day: 24 hours - (9 hours of work, 2 hours of travel, 7 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 2 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 2 hoursNon-work day: 24 hours - (10 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 5 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 7 hoursAssuming you are dedicated enough, you will roughly have about 24 hours per week for preparation. This time can be divided as (Strong section: 7 hours, Moderate section: 8 hours, ""I-am-not-good-at-this"" section: 9 hours) Preparation means: Understanding concepts + solving questions without time limit/with time limit. One of the biggest mistakes before the second attempt is confusing familiarity and conceptual clarity. In the first six months of the calendar year, focus on preparation. In the remaining five months, focus on mocks and test taking strategy and practice. The reason why I am not sharing a time table and talking broadly in terms of hours is because I think everyone is different and needs to have a custom plan. Only you can draft that for yourself. The next thing is to sustain the motivation and having a discipline to stick to that plan (DIFFICULT part)Post June/July, you should not feel the need to go back to the concepts book. The idea of putting more hours in the first six months is to reduce to effort required in the second half. People start getting serious 2 months before the CAT when it's already late. Then nothing helps. Also, before you start your plan for CAT 2016, sit and do a thorough analysis of your last year preparation and performance. What different things are you going to do this time to ensure a significantly better result? Create a monthly plan which is further divided in weeks and days. Keep a little buffer in case a topic is difficult to understand or long. Extreme specificity might not be required (for e.g. morning 30 minutes on 27th January for understanding sum of roots from algebra) but a broad topic wise and section wise plan is better. Once the plan is in place, understand what material will help you achieve it. Coaching institute material + past papers + 2-3 good books should suffice. Apart from that, focus on reading anything and everything to improve your VA RC skills and Puzzles and brain teasers to improve your overall aptitude.If you have specific things to ask, you can always message me. Hope this helps. All the best."
CAT Exam,Is the CAT a tough exam?,https://www.quora.com//Is-the-CAT-a-tough-exam,Common Admission Test (CAT),57,"Okay. I am going to post a different reply here. By ‘different’ I mean its not the usual success story that you commonly see from CAT toppers where they have cracked the exam within 2 attempts with just under 6 months of preparation.You have many websites for those success stories - GPkafunda.com, Careers 360 and MBA UNiverse. Websites like these post only the story of the toppers. You hardly get to hear the other side of the story if you follow only what they have to say. And why not?. If they start doing so, then their market would vanish overnight.I am going to follow the words of our late President APJ Abdul Kalam-“Dont read success stories, you get only the message. Read failure stories, you get ideas to success”and going to give a more realistic picture of this exam.As a person who has been bitten by this exam 4 times- I feel I have to give out my opinion when I saw this question come up in my feed.The straight answer to this question is- YES. CAT is tough. But the word ‘tough’ has got nothing to do with the content or the syllabus or the preparation.CAT- being a competitive exam, suffers from the same three shortcomings that almost all other competitive exams in India( like GATE, IBPS, IITJEE, AIEEE, UPSC) suffer from- competition, reservation and irrational admission criteria.Its important to know about these three things before you attempt this test.Heavy competition: About 2 lakh people on an average give CAT every year. And guess how many seats are there in all IIMs put together?. Just 4000. Is it not fair to say that the odds are always stacked up against you?. This is one factor which will always bring you down. You can think that you are well prepared. But there will be atleast 20 people who are probably more well prepared than you. This is not unique to CAT, but its unique to any government level entrance exam in India.Reservation: Now, dont get me wrong. I know its there because of social justice and all. And I am not asking anyone to cite reservation as an excuse in case you fail. But, even an SC student will find it difficult to an extent as the cut-off for the top IIMs would still be >90 percentile. You can check it here- http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/users....Admission criteria: A lot of B-schools look at your 10th , 12th scores as a pre-requisite. This is very unfair- IMO. Because you may not have performed well in your 10th Boards due to a variety of reasons. For example- my grand-dad died just 2 days before my 12th Board exams were to start. It was a painful experience for me as he was quite close. As a result- I could not concentrate much. Luckily I managed to score 93% overall aggregate. And my brother had developed a sudden viral fever during his 10th Boards. He could not concentrate for the first few days.Apart from these three factors, there is one which is unique to CAT- the normalization process. This used to be a big deal till CAT 2013. Since there are multiple slots, there is a possibility that one slot might have had a relatively easier question set compared to others. Thus the scores of the easier slots are normalized to a scaled standardized score out of 450 and then you are ranked based on that. And how this normalization is done- remains a million dollar question.And none of these factors are under your control. How is your 10th performance supposed to be a deciding factor in your selection?. Your social circumstances could have been different. Your level of schooling would have been different, your guidance and financial status would have been different. All these are NOT taken into account by the top IIMs.Point is- to eliminate the heavy competition, B- schools use these tricks as a means of filtering out students.Now coming to the much hyped ‘difficulty level’ of CAT. I think that this is probably where most success stories you hear from toppers are centered around. The actual syllabus is just elementary maths and English. And its not that difficult to solve these questions once you remove the three factors I mentioned above.I tried a simple experiment. I gave some 10 questions from one of the previous AIMCAT papers to the son of my next-door-neighbour, who is studying in Class 11. He solved all 10 of them correctly within 15 mins!!.And AIMCAT is regarded as one of the toughest CAT prep series conducted by TIME.Why was he able to solve when most of us cant?. Because he is in touch with the syllabus, when most of us are not. Thats the key ingredient you must know.There are three sections in CAT according to the latest 2015 pattern.SECTION- 1: VERBAL ABILITY and READING COMPREHENSIONThis contains a lot of commie level type of passages. The kind you commonly find in editorials of newspapers like the Economic Times, NYT and the Hindu. Most of them would be centered around some topics like - economics, art history, Greek literature, language and semantics, ancient civilizations etc… Atmost 70- 80% of the passages are from these areas. You can read newspapers editorials to get the hang of it. Or else you can try Arts & Letters Daily .SECTION- 2: LOGICAL REASONING and DATA INTERPRETATIONI just hate this section- to tell you the truth. I mean all these complex kinds of bar-graphs and pie-charts , the amount of mind-boggling data you have to process manually. I find this section the most irrelevant. In my experience of the real world- there are scientific calculators and any chart can be easily computed today using Microsoft Excel formulae. Thats how its being done in most organizations. I really feel that this section should be done away with- or atleast we can give a reduced weightage.But what I really like about this section is that its fun. Total fun when you remove the time constraint. And the next best thing is that you need not require any knowledge on complex formula- like you have to remember for Quant related topics. All you have to do is to understand the data given and correlate the various graphs. Most of the questions in this section could be solved when you tabulate all the data in a single table or a single graph.SECTION-3: QUANTITATIVE ABILITY:Probably the most easiest of all. Some may be surprised at this, because they are most likely to have forgotten what they have learnt in their 10th and 12th Maths. But the NCERT books can really be a good foundation with which you can attempt this section. Questions asked are from the following areas.Geometry and Mensuration- Questions on circles, triangles, polygons and properties.Permutation and Probability- Selection, arrangements.Number Theory- Remainder Theorem, Factor theorem.Progressions- AP, GP, HP, Number series.Algebra- equations, functions and graphs.Business Maths- Profit and Loss, SI& CI, RPVs etc…Most of these topics can be found in NCERT text books or you can even refer your old Maths book- if you still have it. Once you have written all the basic formula in a paper, you can easily tabulate them accordingly as to when you should apply which formula.Once this is done- you can solve a lot of sectional tests Probably the most important step. Most are available for free- if you are going with self-study.Or you can enroll in one the coaching centers and take them too- this is the best course for first-timers.But even after doing all this- you have to be prepared for the worst. Like I said before- if you think you are prepared, there are atleast 20 more people who are more well-prepared than you.The difference between the absolute raw scores( not scaled scores) of a 90 percentiler and a 100 percentiler might not be much( most probably a difference of 50–70 marks, going by what I used to analyze with my mock scores). And percentile ranking is flawed to an extent. Its a ranking system - just a relative score and not an absolute way to judge your talent.In summary: Yes, CAT is tough and unique- in its own respect. It has got its own share of flaws too. Its foolish to compare it with JEE/GATE and say that its easier. Its like comparing apples with oranges.","CAT isn’t difficult at all . It is an exam which tests your coolness and decision making power. CAT is all about choosing the right question and leaving a question if it takes much time of yours(Only by constant practice,u can increase the speed and choose the right question).And you should also understand that the colleges doesn’t consider your score and they consider your percentile only. The main reason for failure in cat is the “aspirants ego”(Don’t mistake me guys).Because we test takers, when we did not get the solution for an easy question, we get tensed and try to solve that question, which may eat up our valuable minutes.Strategy to be followed acc. to my point of view:If u r strong in basics then ok; else clear your basics of q,v,r in a month or two(one month is actually enough).Then start solving aimcat test series(Note: Need not solve all qns in ur course books; start aimcat asap)Understand the concepts from course books and then start solving the aimcat series from January itself(THIS IS IMPORTANT: pls pls start aimcat from jan itself; even if u dint complete ur course books).And don’t ever skip any aimcat. Taking aimcat is important but the more imp. thing is reviewing your aimcat papers thoroughly before giving your next aimcat .Reviewing is not all about understanding the “no idea” qns alone. It’s about finding the shortcuts for each qns and sticking to the fastest way of solving the qns. And it’s also important to read the newspapers daily in order to improve ur vocabulary, reading speed(words per min needs to be increased drastically).It helps a lot in GD too.","Is CAT exam really tough? It just might be and at the same time, it might not be. How? Simple, not all humans are same and not everyone have same logical and metal aptitude. Not everyone is preparing the same way you are, Not everyone have been disciplined enough to prepare, Not everyone have their basics clear or have a good vocabulary skills.It is up to you to decide where to land and where do you want to see yourself. Lets take a quick peek at what CAT is,Quant 1.Basic Quant: 12 to 14 questions, This section accounts for Maths that we learn in our 6–9th grades. These contain basic topics like percentages Profit/Loss and what not. Now it depends for person to person on how much time allocation needs to be. Books like Rd Sharma are enough for this section.2.Data Interpretation: 15 to 17 questions, This section is all about reading charts and graphs and analysing the data given , and hence it does not require much practisce until you are like a year to give your exam3.Data Sufficiency : 2 to 3 questions4.Geometry and Algebra : 17 to 18 questions: This is a slightly more tougher topic and you will need some certain professional help in order to master this part of the paper. I would highly recommend you buy correspondence packs of institutions like TIME etc.Verbal 1.Reading Comprehensions: 15 to 17 questions: To improve this part one must read read an dread. There is no shortcut to master RC’s. It is preferable that you read 500–600 passages as part of the preparation as that is the idle size of an RC expected in the paper itself. As you will read for days you will notice that your reading time per passage is decreasing and you will slowly learn the way of speed reading.2. Logical Reasoning: 15 to 17 Questions: These questions are very basic conceptual based algorithms which you have already prbably done in many Olympiads and stuff, no extra practice must go into it if you have a high aptitude.3. Paragraph Completion/Sentence Rearrangement/ Sentence elimination: 3 questions: This involves deep knowledge of grammar and hence I would recommend you to go through the book called Wren and Martin. Grammar will take time to improve and dont stop your practice once you think that you are thorough enough instead keep practicing this till the last day.4.Text Completion/Word Usage:3 questions: For this high vocab skill set is required and I would recommend you to use Word Power Made easy by Norman Lewis, which has application and roots of many words which will not only help you in your CAT but also in GRE GMAT and what not. An app called VoLT (Vocabulary Learning Technique) is also there which is really helpful as it has pictorial representation of words and really large word list for that matter . Do check it out I found it very helpful.Follow the lead given up here and you be just fine, again all I can comment upon is based on what an average person and candidate would prepare for. Maybe you have a very good base of Maths have been speaking English for the most part of your life, then its a complete different scenario.So keep calm and prepare, No need to be scared. Trust on yourself that YES, you have prepared the best way possible and you will be just fine.","No.Cracking CAT is not tough. CAT is an aptitude test. You need to be in high spirits built with good practice. That is the key.Lots of people take the CAT prep too hard on themselves, this ain’t fair. Reason: CAT is an aptitude exam, you can do awesome on your day! It is not a syllabus coverage based exam. It is about solving the questions you know well -an exam of calm mind - selection of easy to moderate questions and solving them!But, the other side is also not cool - you should not just do nothing or do bits and pieces.What I advice my students is to practice hard till a month before CAT and then relax a month before CAT - only do basic revision and give a few mocks. Keep your calm in the final month. Aptitude, once built, stays for long. So practice and then relax and enter CAT.Load nahi lene ka guys!Best wishesRahul SirFollow my CAT prep group on: CAT Prep with IIM A alumni"
CAT Exam,How do I prepare myself for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-prepare-myself-for-CAT,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation",100+,"The following article describes the way I prepared for CAT (2016). This strategy worked for me and hopefully it works for all you guys as well.WARNING!!! – This is a pretty lengthy but descriptive article so those who don’t have the time, maybe you can come read this later!I started preparing seriously from the month of March. So here it goes:March – May: PRACTISE, PRACTISE PRACTISE!!!I dedicated this period to work on the “Fundas” and getting conceptual clarity on various topics.Before I get onto what I did, I just want to say that if any of you out there want to sign up for an online or offline course where all the necessary Fundas are taught well – then please visit 2IIM’s official website. This is by far the best place to get all your basics right.Here is the link: http://www.2iim.com/The director of 2IIM, Rajesh Balasubramanian himself is an alumni from IIM-Bangalore and to put it in simple words – his style of teaching and more than anything his articles and blogs are AMAZINGG!!Coming back to the main content, my advice to those of you who are just starting your prep will be: focus on practicing as many questions as you can. This is not the time to take full length MOCK CATs.Quant: I had bought TIME material, so I just stuck onto those. Those books are very good and give enough practice for any serious aspirant. The TIME material consists of 3 types of exercises: Conceptual Review, Exercise-(a), and Exercise-(b). So, I solved each and every problem from the TIME books and I feel this is very important because this is when one becomes familiar with all the different types of Quant problems that are likely to come in the actual CAT.DI/LR: Again, to prepare for this section, it takes a lot of practice. So just practice all the problems that are there in the TIME material. When I started solving DI/LR problems, I somehow found that I was able to solve LR problems easier than DI. But the truth is, I feel DI problems are easier to score as once you figure out how to get the answer (which will take less time than in LR), you will invariably get it. Also, the main thing in DI is understanding the given data as quickly as possible and figuring out a way to get a solution with the given data. A similar thing holds good for LR problems as well.Another important thing is, DO NOT use the online calculator for every tiny bit of calculation when solving DIs. You can use it for some end-calculations where there is a complicated division or so involved.VA/RC: This section is something that many engineering aspirants tend to under-prepare. As far as the English section is concerned, it requires consistent practice and the fruits of your efforts can be seen only much later, unlike the other two sections. For RC, the only way to do well is to develop a good reading habit. So, even if you have never had a reading habit, it’s high time you start because RC is all about comprehension. The ability to look out for what is important even as you read will come only when you keep reading. Also, your reading speed will improve only with practice. So while reading RCs, the strategy is to make a mental 1-line summary of every passage, as you read. So once you start answering the questions, you know which passage to go and look at while referring the RC. I figured out these things from Rajesh Balasubraminan’s blog and articles.Here are some of his links:http://catscores.2iim.com/http://iimcat.2iim.comVA section is again only practice. This section has various types of questions like Para-Jumbling, Sentence Correction, Fill in the blanks question, etc. Again, practice literally every single problem there is in the TIME material. That is the only way the next couple of months of your CAT prep will go on smoothly.The essence of what I want to say is solve every single problem in the TIME material. To do that you have to frame a schedule. Back-work and figure out a schedule that you can stick on to so that you will be able to finish all the TIME materials before May. You can divide months into weeks and divide weeks into days and plan what you’ll be doing every day, so that it finally adds up till May. One important thing is to plan a realistic schedule. And by that what I mean is if there are 30 days in a month, don’t plan something for all the 30 days. Keep like a buffer of 5-6 days of nothing, so that if anything spills over from the other days, you can use your buffer days for finishing what you had scheduled.June-August: ACCURACYThis is a good time to start taking your full-length MOCK-CATS. I followed AIMCATs. The whole of Internet is filled with stories of how AIMCATs are much harder than actual CAT. But, personally I never felt so. AIMCATs are approximately of the same difficulty level as the actual CAT. So, take them seriously.Quant: I wanted to get even more practice for all the topics, so I spent about 2 months finishing the Arun Sharma book: LOD-I and LOD-II. I feel Arun Sharma’s Quant book is amazing and it will be useful if you get to practice from this book. So if you have the time, then go ahead and finish solving this book also.DI/LR ,VA/RC: If you are done solving the TIME material, then you should start solving sectional tests that any coaching centre offers. I followed TIME for this. Their sectional tests are good and plenty. I was never able to finish all the tests for any of the sections. But keep doing it till the D-Day.Accuracy is everything so it’s really important to know the right way to analyse your MOCKs. You can find more detailed explanations on Rajesh Balasubramanian’s blogs. But here’s a gist of what I followed:Re-Solve the entire paper.· Make a note of the type of mistakes that you make. I used to tabulate them in an Excel sheet (to make it interesting)For example:o Conceptual Mistakes – because you didn’t know how to do that problem ->Again make a note of the solution.o Silly Mistakes -> Make sure the number of silly mistakes keep reducing with each MOCKo Questions you shouldn’t have attempted -> some questions are too hard/tricky – you should be able to make that judgement before you attempt.o Questions you should have answered, but you didn’t.· There are some types of questions that repeatedly appear in your MOCKs and have also appeared in previous CAT papers.o Ex: Some English words – add them to your vocab list and keep revising them everydayo Some types of Quant problems like – lying milkman, mixtures, compound-to-simple interest ratios.Make a note of such things and revise them everyday.Also, DO NOT keep comparing your percentiles with other people or your immediate previous percentile. Your performance must be measure over a period of time and generally AIR ranks give a better measure of where you stand in the country.September-November: STRATEGY & CONCEPTSThis period is extremely crucial and can be very nerve-racking. This is the time when you’ll have to slowly start forming a strategy as to how you will be answering the questions (in which order and how much time). I followed the following strategy:VA/RC: I decided that I would answer all the RC questions first and then only do VA section. Since, invariably more number of questions were for RC section in my MOCKs. The CAT-2016 pattern was such that the exact number of questions in each section was not known. But I went with the strategy of spending 2/3rd of the time for RC (40mins) and 1/3rd for VA (20mins).DI/LR: Between DI and LR, I had decided that I would do DI first and then LR. In DI, I decided I would do the easiest DIs first. Then I would do the easiest LRs. After this, I should have solved approximately 2 DIs and 2 LRs. Then if I have time, I would go back to the DI section to the DIs that can be done but will take a little more time to do. If there is time even after this (which is very unlikely), I will do the remaining questions from the respective sections.Quant: In this section I decided to spend half the time to literally solve all the very easy problems in the section. There will be at least 10-12 very easy/easy level problems, which you can do and which you should do. Then, in the remaining half of the time, whichever questions I knew how to do, but would take a little time to solve, I did those problems. And during the first half, I would ‘Mark for Review’ the problems which I should do for the second half.Depending on the difficulty level, you should solve anywhere between 20(if section is hard)-30(if section is easy) questions per section to get 98+ or 99+ percentile.Day before CAT: BE POSITIVE!Quite honestly, there is not much preparation that you can do on this day. So just relax! Spend time with people who will encourage you and will make you feel good about yourself. And whatever you do make sure your morale is up and you stay positive. Also, make sure you keep a check on all the important stuff that you need for your exam the next day. Try to get a good sleep! ;)D-Day: TRUST YOUR EFFORTS AND BE EVEN MORE POSITIVE!DON’T go late to the exam centre! The last thing you need is feeling tensed about the small things. Remember to feel good about yourself and your efforts. The more you believe in your efforts, the greater are the chances that you will score well. Also, keep telling yourself that none of your efforts will ever go waste so just have faith in yourself and be positive!If you’ve reached the end of this article, well I got to say: Thanks for taking the time to read and hope this gives you direction for your CAT preparation. All the best for all the aspirants!With that said, I’d like to mention that I had got 96.72 percentile in CAT-2016. As far as I can remember, I attempted 29 questions in VARC, 15 in DILR (it was the hardest section) and 15 in Quant(I messed up my time management a little).My goal was to do PhD in one of the IIMs and get into teaching and management research. So I had applied for the doctoral programme at IIM - A,B, C. This programme is called FPM - Fellow Programme in Management. Will write an article on FPM and how to prepare for it very soon. Most of the entrance exam scores can be used to apply for this. I chose CAT as I wanted to keep my options open - in case I didn’t get FPM, I thought of pursuing MBA.I am currently pursuing FPM in IIMB in the area of Marketing.","A step-by-step guideGo online, google CAT Online Preparation.Click on the second link - one that says online.2iim.com.Sign up as free user, try out a few classesBe reasonably impressed and say “I am going to see what the reviews say about online coaching”Go online and google “CAT Online coaching review”.Check out this link What is your review of 2IIM Online CAT Preparation?Go to Online CAT Coaching and CAT Preparation: Crack CAT 2016 and start preparation.I run 2iim and we guys here believe that CAT preparation should be fun and not overwhelming.

About 2 lacs aspirants appear for CAT examinations. Understandably, competition is very steep.The CAT exam is generally conducted in November each year. You are entitled to appear for the CAT exam if you are a graduate or in the final year of a bachelor’s degree. The CAT exam is a computer-based exam, which consists of the following three sections:Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VRC)Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI & LR)Quantitative Ability (QA)Tips on Preparing for CAT examCAT aspirants should always commence early in preparing for the exams as an early start would suffuse them with an all out knowledge and strategy to go about the examination.English reading , comprehension & Maths reasoning , logical skills are to be primary focus areas in order to cross the hurdle of CAT exams and get admitted in your dream MBA institute.Reading extensively (be it any news paper, magazines, journals, novels) will give that extra edge to get over the reading and comprehension section in CAT examination. Repeated Maths practice will make you a pro, and you will pass with flying colours in the CATS maths section. There are never long equations in CAT, the only thing which works is the smart way of calculations which can be mastered by practicing the tricks available in books and internet.You must associate yourself with the people who have successfully cracked the CAT exams and imbibe confidence and take useful tips from them. CAT students should look at questions from previous years' CATs and understand its syllabus.A mandatory part of your CAT preparation would be to take online mock tests and sharpen your abilities, ideas and timing as far as taking on the examination is concerned. In this context you should asses the mock test results and work on your shortcomings before taking the final plunge.Managing one's time includes balancing speed with accuracy, handling the pressure and uncertainty and the apt decision making.learning to allocate time while answering to various sections of the CAT exam paper is very essential. It is so since you need to finish the paper on time with almost all the correct answers to score maximum.Negative marking is a part of CAT. Aspirants are advised to not take wild guesses in the Exam paper. Only if the student is able to eliminate 2-3 choices, then he should take a guess. Otherwise there is no point in wild guessing, as it may drop ones chances of making it right.You must unwind before the exams. Over stressing can have negative impact on your output during the examination. Be your natural self and confident. Keep calm and cool. You must be aware of your examination centre before hand, all the documents, stationeries you need to produce at the centre should be kept handy so that trifle mismanagement may not unnerve you.Doing well in the CAT exam is the first step to ensuring that you get the education to build a great future. It involves a lot of hard work and is one of the most difficult competitive exams. But with right kind of focus and determination you are sure to be successful in cracking CAT.I hope you had a good read. All the best for your exams.

The pathway to premier B-schools, the CAT is back! A mighty test for fighters and adventure seekers, CAT has been unforgiving yet rewarding. It’s a test for the brave hearts!I have benefitted immensely from many teachers, friends and years of self-effort because of which I sailed through this exam. CAT 2018 is knocking at our doorsteps and I am sure many of you will be unsure and worried at this moment. Don’t be! It is now my turn to give back to the community as I share crucial superior exam taking strategies that benefitted my friends and me.Before you begin:You generally have about 45 minutes of waiting time before the test actually begins. For any test taker, these 45–50 minutes are filled with nervous nerves and anxiety. You keep looking at the time clock again and again and start getting fidgety and nervous.What you could instead do is practice mental maths. Practising mental maths during this dull period will keep your brain active. You could also solve a few 3-digit multiplication/division sums/ calculate the reciprocal values on the rough sheet provided. These small activities will help you warm up your brain before the VA-RC section begins. It will also avoid any sort of negative emotions to bother you.As the downtime nears 10 minutes, you could do some deep-breathing activity(Pranayam)/ alternate nostril breathing by keeping your eyes closed.2. Verbal Ability and Reasoning Comprehension:As you might be aware, the VA and RC questions are jumbled up. As a smart test- taker, you should know where the questions are spaced. So what I will suggest you to do is to click on the “Question Paper” icon (top right of the screen) and note down all the RC question numbers on your rough sheet.Click on the Question Paper icon to see the entire question paperBy doing this process, you won’t waste time searching for the RCs in the middle of the exam. Smartly skim through the entire paper within 1–1.5 minutes and start attacking the RCs. I would advise you to begin with the 6 Question RCs and then move on to the 3 Question RCs followed by the VA section. Starting with RCs is a safe strategy as it gives your mind some cooling time as you read and removes the jittery pressure at the beginning. By starting with VA, you may get confused and worried as most of the VA questions are Type-Ins and you aren’t sure of the answers.RCs can be a big confidence booster. Finish all the 24 RC questions in one go.It is better to read the passage with the goal of understanding rather than just merely speed reading. If you are confused between the options, skim the passage again and always go with what the passage says. Most of the RC questions should be solved using the “Option Elimination” technique. Write down A,B,C,D,E in your rough sheet and strike out the wrong options for each question.For the VA part, start with the type of questions you are comfortable with. I would start with the Odd-Man out questions and then do the Summary and Para Jumbles.Also, ensure that you complete the paper. A good test-taker may finish the paper with max 2–3 minutes remaining. So don’t fret!Pro-Tip: Attempt all the questions ! Yes, most of the toppers do this. Don’t leave anything unattempted in VA-RC . You need to take this risk as you won’t be able to take such a risk in DI-LR or Quant as there is always a grey area and possibilities of doubts in English answers.What if you go blank?Chill ! You won’t ! This is not a UPSC exam where you have to rely on memory. You can sip water or snap your fingers or even clap slowly to regain your concentration. A good suggestion is to pull your ears-this acts as a great stimulus to activate your brain.3. Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:If you can survive DI-LR, you can survive anything in the world! Seriously! This probably is the toughest section in the CAT exam. Before sharing tips to solve this section, let me tell you one attribute that you should possessATTITUDE!Yes, its all about attitude! Develop the courage to bleed and suffer setbacks in the first 30 minutes. The first question I marked last year in this section was on the 31st minute! So, don’t be too hard with yourself and don’t give up, just don’t. This is a battle of nerves and even the best test-taker feels the same.The first thing you need to do is to see all the 8 sets and mark each set according to the following parameters:Apparent difficulty levelYour familiarity with that type of set (have you done such a set before)Should I attempt it now or later?Write comments on each set in your rough sheet For Eg.Set 1- Trains-Lot of variables and incomplete data, time-consuming-Not quite familiar-Do laterIt is very important to choose the sets. You just need to focus on 4–5 sets and do it correctly to come in the top rankers. So, the first set that you choose is very important and vital for the confidence boost. Even if you choose the wrong set first and are stuck up, evaluate if it is worth solving the entire set now or are you capable of solving it or is it better to let go and move on.Many times students leave the set because they haven’t done such a set before or haven’t seen such a type. Don’t commit this blunder. Read each and every set and try solving 1–2 questions from them. Remember that you need not solve all the 4 questions in the set. Even if you solve 2 questions from a set, its perfect.Remember that most of the sets will have variable data (i.e. the inputs vary depending on the question). Avoid being bogged down by the difficulty of this section. I believe that if you smartly manoeuvre through the section like a hawk, you will crack it. The more calm and composed you are, the better your performance will be.Enjoy the process and approach it with a smile. If you get panic then its difficult to move ahead. Many top scorers have typed in their answers in the last 25 minutes of the paper.Keep speaking to yourself- is there a jugaad to get this answer? Can I go with the option elimination technique? Which answer seems reasonable?At times, option substitution works, at times option elimination works. You never know!Pro-Tip:Target more than 10 questions with 90 % accuracy. However difficult the paper may be, attempt to solve more than 10 questions correctly. You can take calculated risks in the Type-Ins.4. Quantitative Aptitude:Over the years, CAT has reduced the difficulty of the Quant section and made it less of formula based. The paper nowadays is filled with raw-maths skills and basic knowledge. The key here is timing and accuracy.A good timing strategy is to divide the paper into 4 parts-10–10–10–4questions-and devote 15 minutes to each slot.So, I would focus only on the first 10 questions in the first 15 minutes and not look at the entire paper. Treat these 10 questions as a test to be solved in 15 minutes. Look through these 10 questions in any order. You can leave questions for the next round. So say, I could solve 7/10 questions in the first 15 minutes, that’s great! I mark the 3 questions for later and move ahead. Once the clock goes beyond 15 minutes (i.e. 45th minute), go to the next 10 questions. Now, consider question number 11–19 as your new set to be solved in 15 minutes. This strategy divides the paper into small doable chunks.In the last 15 minutes, you can resolve the questions you have marked. By this strategy, in the first 45 minutes, you might have solved about ~18 -20 questions with 100 % accuracy. And in the last 15 minutes, you can go for the kill. Don’t leave the Type-Ins unattempted as they don’t have negative marks. Attempt all the Type-Ins. Don’t get too distracted by the calculator. Use it only if you need to do a big calculation. Develop a feel for numbers and you will be fine!Don’t leave the question by just reading it. Do some rough work and see if something can be done. Again, avoid leaving questions from topics you haven’t done. At times, students leave very easy questions from Probabilty / PnC /Geometry at the face value.Jugaad:Use your pen and paper as a scale to measure objects and angles from the screen in Geometry ! Yeah ! Many times you are unable to find the length or calculate angles, in such situations, go with what you seem evident from the screen.(Try this at your own risk)Pro-TipDon’t look at the entire paper at the beginning. This strategy can be disastrous here as it is the last section and you are just recovering from a disaster named DI-LR !Attempt more than 24 questions with a great accuracy and you will ace this section.Always do some rough work for each question.What to do in the last week before CAT?Meditate and sleep wellAvoid social mediaSolve CAT 2017 Slot 1 and Slot 2 paper end-to-endKeep reading articlesPractice 5–6 DI-LR sets every dayRevisit your previous mocks and solve the DI-LR sets without looking againIn the final analysis, stay happy ! Don’t attach too much importance to this exam. Whatever is the best for you, will happen ! Wishing you all the very best ! You can contact me on my email address to help you with any further doubts.I am grateful to all my teachers and friends for helping me in this MBA journey. I am grateful to the practices taught by the Art of Living foundation (Sudarshan Kriya) which helped me stay calm during this period.Best wishes!Soham D’SouzaMBA (Class of 2020)- NITIE, MumbaiB.Tech (Class of 2015)- Institute of Chemical Technology (former UDCT),MumbaiOriginal article published onExam taking strategies for CAT 2018 – Soham D'Souza – Medium"
CAT Exam,How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-did-99+-percentilers-prepare-for-CAT,"Prepathon, Exam and Test Results, Common Admission Test Percentiles, Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",100+,"My authority on the subject? I scored a 99.75 percentile in CAT, 99.55 in XAT, 99.45 in SNAP. This is a walkthrough of my preparation/ how you can go about preparing for CAT and other entrance exams.CAT is considered to be one of the most difficult entrance exams in India, but it is isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most of the topics that are tested in CAT are High school level topics. The difficulty lies in the fear of the test. Most CAT aspirants resign to an assumption that they can’t score above a certain percentile without even knowing what the test is made off, half the game is lost at this point.I have been guilty of the same myself. Jan 2016, I remember looking at lists of MBA colleges and immediately rejecting the top 30 odd colleges for the fact that they all required you to score above 97 percentile or so to realistically make into those colleges. It was only when I talked to my father and he explained to me the negativity in my thinking, that I realised, I hadn’t even seen what CAT consisted of. I had no logic in leaving out the possibility of scoring an extremely high percentile.Another reason why I felt that I had to score an extremely high percentile were my 12th class marks. MBA colleges give weightage to academic profile. A self-analysis made me realise that having a low score in my 12th class (69%) was a huge handicap. If I had got a low percentile I would’ve found it extremely difficult to make into the colleges of the relevant level. I would’ve ended up in colleges ranked even lower. I had to score a 99+ percentile. BELIEVE you can Crack the CATHow to go about:I have divided the preparation for CAT into four parts:Pre-preparation, Preparation, Practice, Taking the CATPre-PreparationThere are a few things you’ll want to have in place before you start your preparation for CAT and other exams.Find three hours a day (not in bits and pieces here and there) three continuous hours to prepare. This can be extremely difficult if you are working/ attending college. This might help you to find a few extra hours a day.Get rid of any distractions that you believe affect your concentration or mental state in general. (social media is one of the biggest time-suck and tends to distract you even if you aren’t online)Get in touch with someone who has cracked the entrance exam or has some expertise in the same, you could approach a local coaching centre. (you may not enrol as a full-time student but you would want to be in touch with the faculty there by buying their material or tests etc.) This will be helpful in getting certain finner tips and in case you have difficulties.Get yourself a campaign manager. Cracking the CAT and getting an admission into an MBA college is a long drawn process. You are bound to lose interest or forget important things/ deadlines. Get someone who will keep track of the same. For me, it was my father who helped me keep track of my preparation and all the college applications. Make sure the person you chose exactly understands the process and understands what you want. They will make sure that you are still going even when the motivation starts to run out.Read a lot. This is extremely important when it comes to the verbal ability section of CAT. You will need a lot of broad-based readings and an ability to make sense of what you have read quickly. The passages for reading comprehension in CAT are sometimes extremely abstract and can be extremely difficult to make sense if you aren’t used to reading a lot. Places where you should want to read from: Medium, The guardian, Businessweek Bloomberg, Also read some classic novels that you can lay your hands on, the books talked about on crash course literature are a good place to start.PreparationCAT is divided into 3 sections verbal ability reading comprehension, logical reasoning data interpretation, and quantitative ability. Each of the sections requires equal effort and attention.Time for preparation: There are many people and sites who will tell you that you need 14 hours a day to prepare for CAT. Trust me that doesn’t work. You just need 3 to 4 hours a day consistently over a period of 3- 4 months to crack CAT. Anything more than 5 hours a day can and will burn you out.Source material for preparation: A common mistake that most aspirants will make is relying on just one book/ one source for preparation (particularly anyone who takes coaching). It is recommended that you have access to at least some material from different authors. This will provide you with multiple points of view for the same problems. (same goes for mock tests recommended that take at least 4 to 5 tests from A differen source).Verbal Ability & Reading ComprehensionThis is one of the most frustrating sections in CAT. The question often can seem to have multiple solutions and where options are provided all of them seem correct. Even if you are extremely good with English you can end up messing this section.The key to cracking this section (particularly Verbal ability part) is understanding that this section is more about logic than language. You have to understand the logic as to how the solutions are arrived at (jumbled para is the killer in this section).I initially worked this section by looking at the solutions, that way I was able to see what patterns to look out for and what logic to apply.Work on improving your ability to comprehend complex /long sentences, particularly from topics that you aren’t used to and having complex vocabulary.This section will take a lot of practice to master, more practice than the other two sections. This section has the highest returns for scores. If you get a slightly higher score in this section your percentile can increase drastically. (I scored a 99.98 percentile in this section).Even if you have a good command over the language DO NOT take this section lightly, I know of aspirants who have the CAT along with me having excellent command over the language yet messing up this section completely.Data interpretation and logical reasoningData interpretation is a practice intensive section. There is nothing new that you have to learn in this section. It is just the ability to carry out basic calculations using tools you already have (percentages, averages, summation, division). Practice these basic tools thoroughly so that you are extremely comfortable with them. Also get acquainted with all the various forms of data presentation, such as graphs, pie charts, tables, caselets etc.Logical reasoning is a section which you should and can make the most out of it. The questions are very often similar. While practising logical reasoning the things you would want to learn is gauging the difficulty of the question quickly. If a question is difficult, move on to the next one (time is important).You would want to practice visualising the problem (in mind / on paper ) in the simplest way possible. This will help you breakdown huge paragraphs full of seemingly meaningless words into sensible data.Learn to have an unbiased mind. One of the mistakes you can make in this section is assume somehting that isnt true. Learn to use all the information provided and only than make any conclusion.Read the data carefully a single word can change the whole situation. (for ex. XYZ is not wearing a black pant. can easily be mistaken for XYZ wearing a pant if you miss out on the not.)Quantitative abilityThis is one of the more easier sections to get by, You just have to understand the concepts behind all the topics involved. Again the topics in this section are high school level math. You can over prepare for this section and most aspirants do.There are certain topics in this section that you would want to be extremely thorough with since they appear most frequently (going by the trends of past so many years), such as time speed distance, time work, Geometry, Functions.You would want to also be thorough with averages alligations, percentages ratios since these topics are more helpful in DI section but very rarely make an appearance as stand-alone questions in QA section.Number systems personally I felt for me was an extremely overrated topic ( I spent way more time than required here)PracticeTaking mock tests, I feel mock tests will be the most important part of your preparation as they help you guage exactly where you stand. (another benefit is to know which colleges you should apply to).What is a good number of mock tests to take? There isn’t any concensus on this topic, there are CAT toppers who got by on hardly any mock tests, and than there are people like me who took close 40 mock tests.Personally mock tests where the biggest source of practice for me. I took mock tests from 3 different sources. ( I recommend atleast 2 different sources). Once you have taken a mock test it’s extremely important that you analyse them well, I spent about an hour and half after every mock test to analyse where I have gone wrong and what can be changed. Mock tests are also a good time to test out strategies in handling various sections. (I will try to come with a detailed post about analysing mock tests.)I will boast a little here, but thanks to the trends on my mock tests I was extremely confident of getting the percentile I got on CAT. ( I expected at least a 99.5 %le)I recommend practicing during the time slot you will actually be answering the CAT, I had to take the CAT on a sunday in the morning slot (9.30 to 12.30) at a centre 30 kms away from home. Considering the reporting time of an extra hour, I would have to technically leave my house at 7 in the morning on the day of the test. I usually get hungry within 2 and half hours of eating anything. So in the month before CAT I trained my body, by having breakfast at 6 in the morning and not having anything till 1pm. I also trained myself to sit at one place for 4 hours (830 to 1230). This may seem funny/ unnecessary but on the day of the test you dont want to have any other factors troubling you.Taking the CATTry to stop preparation for CAT at least 3 days before CAT (there are people who will disagree and reccommend you remain in the mood and keep preparing) anything you try to “prepare” during these last days often will be of very little help. Don’t wander away from the CAT mood though, read or at least make sure you are sitting 3 hours at a place for these last few days ( to stay in the CAT mood).Do not take a mock test in the few days before CAT, If you mess the mock it is likely that you will panic on the day of the CAT.Do not keep any expectations as to the number of questions you want to complete in each section.All the best for your preparation for CAT.P.S. CAT isn’t everything, CAT is hardly a learning experience, you won’t learn anything new as such (well other than how to prepare hard) it’s mostly about things you already know, taking the CAT can hence be a very frustrating experience. I recommend that you learn something else too on the side lines, get a hobby or hold a job (again debatable as to how much time you can find etc.) If you are taking drop read a lot, read all the books you can get your hands on. All in all try to do something else too that will help you grow.Belling the CAT and other entrance exams","This answer is fairly long, about 7000 words. So I have divided my answer into 9 parts wherein each part can be read independently. However reading the entire answer in one go will serve as RC practice, so that would be advisable.What I have mentioned below helped me in my journey from 66% -> 99.85% in CAT. I have tried my level best to be as detailed as possible. GK as a section is not there in CAT as of now but is very important in the other papers like XAT, IIFT, SNAP, etc. So, I have included that as well. I have also put in a little bit about how to attempt mocks and then analyse them to improve further. A little bit on GD-PI-WAT as well, so that this answer serves all your needs.I would like to point out that I have been an average student all my life and am a GEM (General Engineer Male), yes pun intended. My 10/12/B.Tech scores are 83/79/66. With that I made it to IIM Calcutta, so the first thing that you should now do is stop worrying about your previous grades. 99% of the people reading this will surely have better grades. So, if I can you obviously can get through and study at an IIM.My CAT 2015 score card:QA: 99.8%LRDI: 99.96%VA: 87.33%OA: 99.85%This answer is divided into the following parts:A.) How to start?B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityC.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningD.) VA -> Verbal AbilityE.) GK -> General KnowledgeF.) How to attempt mocks? (Non-CAT exams at the end)G.) How to analyse mocks?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?I.) GD-PI-WAT prepA.) How to start CAT prep?Register at any site which lets you attempt and review a mock for free. You could try hitbullseye. If you have already enrolled for a test series or for a classroom programme, then attempt one of their mocks. Many of you would be like bhai abhi toh padhai start bhi nahi ki, mock deke kya hoga aur upar se aadhe questions toh samajh bhi nahi aayenge aur maths ke formula bhi yaad nahi hain. Additionally while attempting the mock, there will be multiple instances when you will feel like getting up because you are not used to solving questions for 3 hours at a stretch. Your brain will also try to deceive you into grabbing your smart phone for checking Whatsapp. You will feel like drinking water, you will also be tempted to check FB. The point of this test is to make sure that all this doesn’t happen when you actually attempt CAT. Now you would be thinking what is the point in attempting a mock when I don’t know $hi+.Precisely my point! The main reason for this mock was to identify what you know, what you don’t, where you stand and how much hard work is required.Once you are done with the mock, check the solutions and find the topics which you already know, which you attempted correctly. Some problems would have been there which you would have been sure of but you got them wrong because you were out of touch and forgot the formula or recalled an incorrect formula. You probably forgot the plural of fish. Fish or fishes? Or does it depend on whether I am talking about a species of fish or multiple units of the same species? Then you will realise that a little brush up of a few topics (which you are out of touch with) will dramatically improve your score. Work on these topics first and then move on to topics which you have no clue about. This mock decides your future course of study.Now, on to the preparation phase.B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityStart off with this site. http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/Click on start and then check your score. You know where you stand. Keep practising a few times every day and your score will keep improving. If you can hit 50-55 consistently in the default 120 seconds, you will easily hit 99.5% in CAT in this section. If you are targeting 99.5+ then I would also like you to memorise the following:B1.) Reciprocals, Squares and Cubes up till 30. Pay attention here, some values will get repeated. As for 1/7. Remember that it is .142857. For other go up to 2-3 decimals,whatever you are comfortable with. I would prefer 3 decimals though.B2.) Power of 2 up till 12Power of 3 up till 8Power of 4 up till 6Power of 5-6 up till 5Power of 7-10 up till 4Power of 11-13 up till 3Again same as above. Some values will be the same. 4^6 has already been covered till 2^12 and so on. Don’t just mug up blindly, pay attention to the numbers.B3.) Square Root up till 10B4.) Factorial up till 10B1-B4: Now most of you would be like, dude they give an inbuilt calculator. But then other exams don’t have that calculator. Additionally who do you think will take lesser time in solving a question? A person who uses the calculator for finding 12^3 or someone who just knows it is 1728. Believe me when I say that this is very important for your LRDI section as well. This will decide whether you get stuck at 99.5% or go beyond that. This is the deciding factor. Please memorise these values.B5.) A few important numbers like 999=27*37, 1001=7*11*13, 21^3=9261.B6.) Some numbers have the property wherein the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the no itself. 1, 2, 145 and 40585. Please remember these.B7.) There are 15 primes till 50, 25 till 100, 46 till 200 and 168 till 1000.B8.) How to find the sum of the first n natural nos. Sum of squares of n natural nos. Sum of cubes, sum of 4th powers. Please remember the formulas. Specially the last one (fourth power), most people forget that.B9.) Scale is not allowed in any of the exams. What the CAT authorities mean is that the scale which we used back in school that is not allowed. They never said anything about using your hand as a scale. Check the length of your fingers. Also check the length of the 3 sub division on your fingers. Use your right or left hand, whatever suits you. Please make sure that you remember these values by heart. These values will help you solve 90% of the geometry questions. Also, buy a protractor and make sure you can make the angles 30, 45, 60, 90 properly. First with the protractor and then without it. Based on the question, make a rough figure. Then based on your lengths, find the answer and then scale up to the value given in the question. Geometry has a lot of formulas, memorize them or use this approach. Approximation ftw!B.10.) Unitary Method. Make sure you are good with this, half the QA syllabus can be solved using unitary method. Do you think whatever has been mentioned in B9 is basically Unitary Method at the end for getting the answer?Most of the students go for solving the maximum no of problems. Don’t do that. Focus on the basics, don't go for solving questions directly like most students. Most students don’t score 99+. You are different, work differently. This is how you should be doing it for any given chapter day wise. First day go after the formulas and try to understand why a certain formula is there. Make sure that you have memorised all the formulas for that chapter. If you were to set the paper, what could be a possible question? Read a formula, try to frame questions on that formula and then memorize the formula. Just memorizing all formulas in one go won't help, because you will probably forget. If you can do this, then you would have solved all the questions by the time you finish reading the theory.Example: Let's say you are studying Numbers. You see the formulas for HCF and LCM of 2 nos. Then you see the factors of a number. Now think of possible questions on this. Let's say 72.1.) How many odd factors are there?2.) How many even factors are there?3.) What is the sum of the odd factors?4.) What is the sum of the even factors?5.) What is the product of the odd factors?6.) What is the product of the even factors?7.) How many factors are squares of natural numbers?8.) How many factors are cubes of natural numbers?Good going, you just completed half the chapter! Similarly think of more questions that you can make. The exercise at the end is filled with such questions. It depends on your thinking. Focus on this. If basics are fine,questions won't be a problem.Would you memorize 456*876 and 235*9865 and things like that or learn how multiplication works?If you think that you lack imagination when it comes to maths and can’t do the above, then no problem. As mentioned above, by the end of the first day you would be done with memorising all the formulas. That’s it. Don’t solve anything. Just make sure all the formulas are deeply rooted in your brain and you can recall them anytime you want. Now take a break for a day. On the 3rd day, start solving problems. But remember that you are to solve by recalling the formula not by turning over the pages and looking at the formula. If you cannot recall, then please make sure you memorize the formulas again. Solve a few problems. Take a day’s break and continue solving on the 5th and similarly on the 7th day as well. This way apart from the formula getting imprinted in your brain multiple times, you will also understand which formulas are asked more often than others. Some chapters are connected to one another. Make groups of such chapters. If working on a group, try to complete all the topics in that group. For example:Ratio Proportion, Unitary Method, Percentage, Profit and Loss.Simple equations, Simultaneous equations, Inequalities, Time speed distance and work, Quadratic.Progression.Numbers, Bases, Miscellaneous equations.Surds and Indices, Logarithms.Mensuration.Geometry.Coordinate Geometry.Probability and PnC.Functions and Graphs.For people trying to clear the cut off in this section. The first 3 with mensuration and a bit of geometry/numbers will be enough.C.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningData Interpretation is speed and practise. The site mentioned in the Quant region and B1-B4 there would be of immense help. These will increase your speed. Generally each and every DI set has at least a problem on percentage or ratio.Today when you start, start off with the sole intention of solving all the questions of a given set. When you can do that on a daily basis. Move to 2 sets a day. When you can do that. Move to 3 sets daily and then to 4 sets. Keep solving as many questions as you can. Time taken per question will decrease with practise. A few months after you were born, you started to crawl, then you started walking and finally you started running. Same thing here. Don’t think about speed now. Speed comes gradually. Let nature take its course.Logical Reasoning, as the name suggests is based on how well you can interpret and analyse things. LR checks your thought process, it checks how you tackle problems. Get this book ""Puzzles"" by George J. Summers. When you watch a football match, why do you watch it? Probably because you want your team to win or you want to see a good contest and enjoy. Similarly, once you have bought this book, think about your objective. It’s not about getting the correct solution, it’s about improving your thought process. And additionally the puzzles in this book are tough. You could think of it as the daddy of Irodov. Engineers will get the joke! You won’t be able to solve most of the problems and frankly speaking I don’t expect you to. However, what I do expect from you is to read a question. Try to understand what has been given. Try to understand what is being asked. Think about it for say 10-15 minutes. Write down whatever approach you can think of. If you could not solve it, look at the hints and their solution scheme. Were you thinking in the right direction?Analyse the difference between the method given in the book and your method.Try to understand what you missed because of which you could not solve the puzzle. Try again for 30 minutes. If you can solve it, good enough, if not maybe try again. After a few more tries look at the solution. Remember you bought the book to improve your thought process, not to solve each question in the first attempt. Trying a puzzle for 5 minutes and then looking at the solution will take you nowhere. Solving again and again till the time you get the answer is what the book was bought for. To make sure that you can think and get the answer on your own. The answer at the end is just for verification. 1-2 puzzles a day. 3 at max, not more than that. You have to improve your thought process,not complete the book as fast as possible. Your scores in the LR section will improve in a month’s time and then it will stay at 99%.Another very important point would be to memorize the alphabet-number conversion table. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. You will come across questions on this in your mocks as well as in the exams.D.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI had 69 and 72 in English in 10 and 12 respectively. My verbal score in CAT went up from 43 -> 87%. Whatever I have written below is what I did to make sure that I cleared the verbal cut off comfortably. If you are looking at a 99+verbal score, then you would be better off by reading the other answers to this question for improving your verbal section. This part is not for you kindly move on to the LRDI section. If you however $uck at English just like me, then this just might help you in clearing the sectional cut off. I tried memorizing words from the GRE word list. My language skills were not good enough to use words like persiflage, perspicuous, ubiquitous, scintillating, etc. in sentences. So, I would keep memorizing and then keep forgetting these words. I had never read novels so I had never come across such words as well. So, I came to the conclusion that memorising words won’t help me. But, a decent vocabulary is needed for CAT. So, I bought this book “Word Power Made Easy” by Normal Lewis. Managed to complete the chapters in a few months. I didn’t do the word list at the end. I would request you to buy this book and complete the chapters.Another thing that seemed obvious to me was that whether you look at RCs or Para Jumbles or Para Completion or Para Summary. All these have basically been written by some person who had a very good command over the English language. So all these things should logically have a flow of thought with which the author would have written the entire thing. You just have to understand that flow. If you can understand an RC, then understanding a paragraph from that RC will obviously be very easy for you. Think about it, a PJ or a PC or a PS are basically paragraphs taken from an RC. You just have to understand the flow in which the entire thing was written by some person who had a decent understanding of the English language. But, then I again had a problem. The Verbal section in CAT was supposed to be of 1 hour and as soon as I would start reading an RC, 8-10 minutes down the line I would feel drowsy. I would start thinking about checking FB or Whatsapp or practically doing anything apart from reading that stupid RC. All those Speed reading techniques, skimming, reading the question first and all. None of that mattered. I understood what my problem was. COMPREHENSION and CONCENTRATION. By the time I was in the 2nd para I would have forgotten what was written in the 1st para. It’s called a READING COMPREHENSION for a reason. Never trade comprehension for speed.How to improve comprehension and concentration?Both will improve gradually with time. First step is to make sure that you don’t feel drowsy when reading for an hour. You will be required to do that in the exam. So you need to build your stamina to concentrate. Start off by reading 2-3k word long articles on News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian. Register on the website and you will get a mail every morning at 10am. Read all the articles from there. Make sure you read at a stretch for an hour. Read everything from Culture to Technology to Art to Literature. In the beginning you will feel sleepy within a few minutes of starting. Slowly you will gain rhythm. Within 15 days you will be able to read 1 hour at a stretch. In a month’s time you will start retaining information as well. Then focus on just 1 category every day. Like only Philosophy or only Art or only culture. With that your stamina and concentration will increase further and since you are reading about only 1 thing for 1 hour, your knowledge in that topic will also increase. This can be done at home, but preferably in office to better utilize your time. PJ PC PS are all extensions of an RC. All will seem easy once you are comfortable with RCs. Here News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian you will be reading 2000-3000 word long articles. Once you are used to this, 500-600 word passages in CAT and other exams will be a piece of cake for you!For verbal, always eliminate choices and then mark rather than directly trying to find the correct answer. This section is different from the other sections,so it has to be dealt in a different manner. Please eliminate choices and then answer. If in doubt, leave. As for the grammar section, I have no idea when to use have and when to use has. Same with is/are and things like that. Neither can I spot grammatical errors in sentences. So, I mostly leave such questions.But I always read them. You can always answer a few of them based on instinct. Some sitters are always there in every paper.E.) GK -> General KnowledgeAll the papers except CAT have this section. Some have a sectional cut off,some don’t. This section can be answered in about 5 minutes. It has the highest marks/min for any section. This section is the key to a high percentile. This section will give you the points for speaking in a GD and PI and also for writing in WAT. So, if you plan on getting through to a good B-School don’t ignore it. There would be 2 methods to prepare for this.E1.) Start reading any newspaper. Go through the headlines and all. Make sure you are updated with what is happening in the country. After a week or so, you will realise that it’s mostly the same thing that keeps getting repeated everyday in the paper. Think of it from the point of view of the exam. There will be MCQs. So they won’t ask for your opinion on Kejriwal vs Modi. Leave all the pages on politics. That’s sheer wastage of time. Don’t waste time on that stuff! Make sure you remember the schemes which Mr Modi keeps rolling out. At least remember the important ones. Did any big firm buy another one? Any Indian who won some award abroad. Who won which Grand Slam? Who won the Pulitzer Prize? Who won the Arjuna Khel Ratna Award? India is working on the Chabahar port with which country? Malcom Turnbull is from which country? I think you would have understood what is expected from you. MBA is about business. Focus on economic and business news more than others. Noble Prize in economics fort his year? How many Deputy Governors are there in the Reserve Bank? Make a doc file with these details. You file would look somewhat like this.https://docs.google.com/document...This is what I had made for this year, so no this won’t help you! You will have to make one with the current affairs of this year. Since you will be working the entire year making this, so by the time the exams are a week away, you will have such a file. You might however think that this is too much work. In that case I would suggest you try the second and relatively easier method compared to this.E2.) Whichever is the first exam for you which will have a GK section, keep 4 days before that exam for making this file and memorizing it. Gather all the monthly booklets which are given to Time students. Each book has about 100 questions. Memorize the ones you think are important. CL and Time both will also have a few sheets on GK, current affairs, etc. Get those as well. CL GK compendium. Hitbullseye gk pdfs are also there. You can get most of these online for free or search on Pagalguy, someone would have uploaded it there for sure. Whatever you think is important, please memorize that. 4 days is more than enough to complete all the material I have mentioned above. By going through the monthly magazines you will also be able to keep track of what is happening in India and also round the globe.The regular reading (The first method, reading daily) means that when the exam sare about to start, you would have completed most of the things. The last 4 days will serve as a revision for you. I did both the above things. So if you have time go for it. A close friend of mine, Prateek, he was preparing for UPSC. He was of immense help! Whenever I would meet him, we would talk about how things going on in our country. Served as revision for him and I would stay updated with facts. So, if you can find someone who is preparing for UPSC religiously,i t would be great. You will also have a contact who is an IAS officer. If you want to score even higher in GK get a small yearbook from some shop. Small ones general contain 100 odd pages, going through that will serve as revision as well.F.) How to attempt mocks (Non-CAT exams at the end)The first step here is to make sure that you can sit and concentrate properly for 3 hours at a stretch. FB, Whatsapp, drowsiness, drinking water or the sudden urge to go to the washroom during these 3 hours have to be removed.Kindly take care of such things which might disturb you, especially the last 2 and then start a mock. When you are attempting the mock, the only thing in your mind should be about maximising your score! Another point that you should keep in mind in that no one cares about what you know and what you don’t. The only thing that matters is your score. So please keep your ego aside when attempting the paper. Yeh question kaise nahi bana, kal hi toh banaya tha and then you spend the next 15 mins on it and still end up marking the wrong answer. Please don’t! You have a fight with your girlfriend and then you are like “I am not texting her first”. Yes I was talking about that very ego of yours, please get rid of it when you are attempting a mock. If you can’t solve a question then please move on to the next one. The examination hall is not the place to derive a formula and then solve the concerned problem. Anyways, I could go on but I think I have made my point.Remember that half the paper is very easy, mostly formula based. Your approach should be to attempt these questions first. Make sure that you have touched the 97-98% mark and then move on to the difficult questions for improving your score.F1.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityYou are not supposed to start from question no 1 and then continue till 34. Most of the times you will not even be able to look at some of the problems in the end. So we will follow a Round by round approach. About 50% of the problems are direct formula based. When you start this section (Round 1), keep the above point in mind. So, as soon as you look at a question. Can you solve it in a minute by using a formula? If the question with a formula was given to a 5th grader, would he be able to solve it. If yes, then solve this question. Use the values given in the question, get the answer and then move on to the next question. If you see a question and you are like, yaar yeh toh banaya hua hai, 2-3 min lagega, lamba question hai. Or if you are like sirf cases likhne hain, phir count kar lunga, phir answer. Such questions which you know you can solve but are not direct formula based, are to be left out now. These have to be attempted in the 2nd round. Getting my point? If formula based, then attempt else next. Within 30 minutes you should have attempted about 16-17 questions and you would have seen all the questions. That will get you at least 97-98% in this section.Now Round 2, there were a few questions which you had seen earlier and were pretty confident about. This is where your brain will help you. The human mind is so awesome that even though you just looked at it once but solved different questions and totally forgot about it, you brain was working on that question subconsciously without you having any idea about it. Now, when you read the question, you will take a lesser amount of time to solve it compared to what you would have taken had you solved it in the first round itself. You could go for Round 3 as well, your choice! But 2 rounds are needed. Please stop with a single round method which most of you are used to now.Why this approach?Many people are most often not able to see the entire paper,so they miss sitters. This round by round technique helps you go through the entire paper and thereby select the easiest ones which in turn maximises your score. You won’t get a prize if you solve a question that only 10 students out of 2 lac could solve. The marks per question is the same. Since you solve the easier problems first, the chances of your committing mistakes goes down considerably. A question which you have solved but incorrectly is not wasted time and only a -1 for your score. Instead of 3 you get a -1. So such a question effectively hits you with lost time and a -4. This method reduces the no of such questions. Hence, this approach.F2.) DILR -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningIf you have tried solving the book which I had mentioned above, you would by now have a fair idea about how to make a table for solving LR problems. 5 people, 5 countries, 5 cars, 5 pets. All of us have solved such puzzles,haven’t we? You would obviously have 4 columns but which would be the first and which would be the second, etc. That determines how fast you will be able to solve the set. Oh, you thought it didn’t make a difference? It does! Sometimes you are better off soling set theory problems by a table. This is where your practise and experience comes into play. Making the proper table means half the work is done then and there. You just have to put in the values and tick mark the correct answers now.Now about how to attempt. When you start the section, go through the 4 LR sets.1-2 sets will be very easy. Take a couple of minutes and try to identify the easier ones. Look at the questions. Do you see any question wherein it asks how many cases are possible or questions of that sort? Such sets are to be solved at the end. Look for sets wherein directly by looking at the questions, you know that there is one unique solution. Use the answer options to further reduce your time for soling that set. Now start with such sets. First advantage of this method will be that you will feel good, because you will be done with a couple of sets in 10-12 minutes. Additionally you will be in a flow and your chances of cracking a difficult set will go up. Now compare this to the case when you start the section, and think that looking at all the questions means losing a few minutes. I am James Bond, so I will start with the first set. 10 minutes later you haven’t completed a single question and now for the remaining 50 minutes you will keep thinking, yaar 10 min faaltu mein barbaad ho gaye. Good luck solving that section and the next with such a mind-set.Many a time it will happen that the set you picked up, is going nowhere and yet time is passing on. For such sets, wherein you have already spent 4-5 minutes but haven’t been able to mark even a single question. Please leave that set.You might be tempted to think sirf 2 min aur, aur phir 4 questions ban jayenge. Please don’t commit that mistake. 5 minutes is the threshold in which you should have been able to mark at least 2 questions. Worst case scenario 1. If you are at 0. Please move on. You are better off solving that set later on,preferably at home!Same with DI sets, go through the sets, select the easier ones, and complete them. You will be left off with 2 sets. Again with 2 options, it always easy to select the easier one. This way most of the times, you will end up solving the toughest set at the end or you will probably leave it. All questions have the same marks, so isn’t it better to solve easier ones? Additionally tougher problems will also take a toll on your brain, your effectiveness for the next section might go down. Do you want that to happen?Sometimes a set will be easy but a question in there will be extremely tough.Beware of such questions, these are put in place to derail your momentum. 5-7 minutes per set is what you should be looking at. Always look at the questions and attempt. You don’t have to attempt all questions from a set. Even 3 attempts for a set is fine. Again, you know the term that I am talking about!Keep that aside when attempting a mock.F3.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI get tired of reading and lose interest quickly. So RCs at the end seems a bad idea. So, I start off with RCs. Again as soon as you start this section. Glance through all the RCs in a minute and check if any of them is from a subject you like. Your reading speed and comprehension will be higher in this case. Again as mentioned above, just because you read an RC, doesn’t mean you have to attempt all the questions. Even 4 out of 6 questions from an RC is good enough. Just attempting for the sake of increasing attempts is sheer stupidity. Please don’t think ki aree yaar itne marks toh already aa hi rahe hain exam mein. Dusron ko thoda mauka de deta hun -2 leke. Please don’t do that. Eliminate options and then attempt. When in doubt leave. Move on to the single questions after the RCs.Note -> For non-CAT mocks which you attempt online.First and foremost thing is that apart from CAT, most are pen paper based, but at home you attempt online papers for these. Take a few print outs of the OMR sheet and check how many minutes you need for marking the answers. Keep a 5 min buffer for your safety. Let’s say we talk about IIFT. It’s a 2 hour paper in real. However I need 20 minutes just for marking the bubbles. So, there is absolutely no point in attempting the online paper at home for 2 hrs. Submit the test after 100 minutes. Don’t worry if people attempt for 2 hours and your rank is low. Your score in the main exam matters, not in this one. Similarly for SNAP and XAT as well. Form a basic strategy of how you would like to attempt the paper for the 100 minutes(whatever your time is after you have checked marking in the OMR sheet). Like for Snap, I had a strategy of 5-6 minutes for gk then 16-18 minutes for verbal, then 35-40 minutes for LR. Then maths and as soon as it would be 90 minutes after the start, I would mark all the answers. Then solve and again mark in the last 5 minutes. Similarly make your strategy for IIFT, SNAP, XAT, etc. and stick to it.G.) How to analyse mock?The instant you submit a mock, you will have a score in mind, itna toh banta hai. 1 sec later the page reloads and you see your score and you go, are yaar itne toh 2 section milake hi aa jane chahiye the. This is why analysing the mock is important. You knew a certain score was achievable but your score went down drastically because of silly mistakes. Analysing mocks will take care of such mistakes. Once the solutions and result for a mock are out. First of all check up all the problems which you couldn’t solve. That’s what you have to learn.Then look at the time taken by the topper in solving a question. Look at your time. Did you take 200 seconds whereas the topper took 30 seconds? That’s because there is a technique you don’t about. Learn that technique. Write it in your notebook where you write formulas. That was about identifying and learning things which the toppers know. You have to be one of them. Go through the mocks and find such methods. AdditionallyThen there will be a category of questions you were sure of but you somehow used your talent and got it wrong and after looking at the solution you are like aree yaar yeh koi kaise galat kar sakta hai. But as a matter of fact, you did! This will happen mostly in counting problems (Numbers). Even if you had 100 in English in 10 and 12 you will still come to know that you had been using some Grammar rule incorrectly or there is some exception you had no clue about. But, after a -4 you will remember them! You will sometimes come to know that a certain word which you have been using all your life can also be used in a totally different context. Thank You without an exclamation mark? Sarcasm! Oxymoron, alliteration, etc. Learn what these mean. Such mistakes will make sure you remember all these. Sometimes you will take the diameter as the radius and solve. Sometimes 2*3 will become 5 and sometimes 7*19 will become 114. Don’t rush through problems. The paper is set so as to give you enough time. Slow and steady wins the race.Then another section in the results shows the % of people who attempted a question and % of people who got it right. You are supposed to attempt the easy ones first, then the average difficulty questions. Finally attempt a few difficult ones or totally leave them out. Here you can check which questions you were supposed to attempt but didn’t. Also the questions which you were supposed to leave but being the Bond that you are, you nonetheless decided to attempt it thereby losing marks and giving others a chance to overtake you. If your family is worth billions of dollars, you could do that, but given that you are still reading this, I doubt it! So whenever you look at such questions, try to think about what was in your mind during the mock which made you do such a thing. Try not to commit the same mistake again.Yes, I agree all this will take more than 3 hours. Who told you getting into a good B-school was easy?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?The study material from the top 3 institutes namely Time, CL and IMS is mostly the same. I have seen and used it, so use whichever you want, it won’t make a big difference. A few new ones like Hitbullseye and test funda are also coming up. Haven’t used the material by these 2 so can’t comment. In terms of content the level of questions is higher in Time. I mean tougher questions here, so you are better prepared for CAT, but then you could also argue about why put in more effort than required. In CL, the theory and explanations for quant is way better that that in others. Theory for quant is literally non-existent in Time. IMS is good for verbal. As mentioned above, please use that book for LR and also that book for Verbal. I have not mentioned the names of the books, because if you scroll up and check you will then remember the name when you have to tell it to the shopkeeper! That LR book will help make a strong base for you and then completing the LR material from these institutes will give you practise and improve your skills further. For those who keep talking about Arun Sharma, please please please use proper material. Do you really think 1 book is good enough for your CAT preparation and others are stupid who go through all that? If you think you are smart enough and don’t need all that and 1 book is enough. Good Luck with CAT!Mocks basically tell you where you stand when compared to the toppers in the country. Time has the most no of people attempting its Aimcats. So having that is a must. Next in line, with the maximum no of people attempting the mocks would be CL. After that you have IMS, test funda and all. Aimcats are pretty tough when compared to actual CAT but are extremely important because it gives you a true picture of where you stand and how much more effort you need to put in. CL mocks are close to the CAT level especially in terms of quant. IMS mocks are close to CAT level in verbal. I would suggest Time + CL/IMS. You can however take all the 3 if you want. Or maybe some other institute’s mock series. It’s mostly about practise.The mock questions are mostly the same. It’s just the values that they keep changing every year. Same with the material. Whether you look at the material of this year or that of 5 years ago, you will realise that it’s mostly the same. So, you are better off buying old material from someone or from a secondhand book store. I have uploaded some mocks and some prep material. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...https://drive.google.com/open?id...I also found some useful material from total gadha. Here’s the link for thathttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...I.) GD-PI-WAT prepFrankly speaking, getting a score is easy. This is the tougher part. This requires more hard work because in here, you will be up against the best in the country. Most of the people attending the interviews will come prepared, so here your odds will be higher. So, please work hard for this. GDPI prep as such should be dealt with in a different question. So, won’t go into the details here, but just an over view of what is expected of you. If you had done the GK and current affairs part as mentioned above, you will be easily able to manage the WAT. You will also have ample of points for speaking in a GD. Similarly questions on current affairs in a PI will also be a piece of cake for you. What remains is the HR part. In here, you have to understand that you can guide the interview and you can force them to ask exactly what you have prepared. But that requires a little thinking. Tell me about yourself is a standard question which is used to initiate an interview. It is mostly followed by your strengths and weaknesses. The main thing here is that you have to try to make a story and link everything that you have done in your life till now with why you want to do an MBA. The interviewers are smart people, they have been doing this for years. They are extremely good at catching liars. So think this through well. This part of your prep needs your utmost dedication and hard work. Prepare your answers properly. It is really tough to explain how to prepare for GD-PI. You will be better off at some institute where someone can guide you individually. However, what I can still do is upload all the GDPI material that I have and share it with you. But do keep one thing in mind, this contains some files on the current affairs of 2015, so that will be of no use for you. The other stuff is pretty much relevant. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...I hope you convert your dream college. May the force be with you!","How ‘NOT’ To prepare for CAT/GMATOne of the most important strategy in CAT/GMAT is to find out the wrong choices to identify the right one. This post is dedicated to “Avoiding Mistakes” strategy.Myth & Mistake-1: Following the Herd. Choosing a help or any coaching because others are choosing itHumans belongs to Animal kingdom. If you have studied Biology, then this point will be easier to understand. In animal kingdom. Weak animals are always in herd but the strong one is solitary or always having small groups. Ever wondered Why??The answer lies in the mentality. A strong animal judges the situation and leads its life based on its experience but a weak animal actions are based upon others. If others are doing it, then it’s wise to do it. You can choose to be a Herd follower or to make your own paths.Never follow the group. A leader never follows. If you will move with a group, you will always be with them. If you will create your paths, then only you can beat others. Adding following lines from Robert Frost to add a dramatic touch:“Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”Myth & Mistake-2: Focusing on absolute number of Successful Candidates rather than Percentage.Most of the Institutes talks about the number of success stories but are silent on how many of their students were unsuccessful. Even their Advertisements talks about total number of students getting Interview call or final admits. But the real numbers are shocking, most of the Institutes have 2-3 % students getting expected result.But the magic is in numbers. Make people follow a Herd and even if 2-3% students are successful, the success numbers become substantial. The problem is that your chances of landing in the unsuccessful students group is 98%, but this data does not bother them because they know how to work upon the “Herd Mentality” of the population. Show them 2% success stories and make them follow a herd.Myth & Mistake-3: The Bigger the Better.I am referring to Class Strength. No teacher can teach a herd. If your batch size is more than 10-12 students, then you are not getting proper attention from a teacher. If the education company is claiming “Customized or Personalized” services, then the class size must be less than 10-12 students.Myth & Mistake-4: Going after a Brand or No.1 education companyAll Branded books are easily available in the market at very low-cost. A student joins any help or coaching to get a personalized teaching experience. A Teacher-Student relation is analogous to a Mother-Child relation. There is nothing called “No. 1 Mother”. Every mother is No. 1 for her Kids and the reason is her personalized attention.Rather than sitting in a large group with “No. 1”, you should aim for a personalized attention (We join any help for their teachers or their course offering).Myth & Mistake-5: Deciding after taking DemosAll Institutes stage their Demos. They are very carefully planned. The teacher is usually the teacher, who will not teach regularly. If anyone says “Book your demo” or guide you to a specific time, then it is staged. The best way is to ask them about their class timings and insist on sitting in the ongoing class. If you feel the focus is on you, then you are at the wrong place.Try to identify honest institutes. Honesty should be a very important deciding factor.Myth & Mistake-6: Choosing Institute which makes “Toppers” or just focuses on “Past Records”Never choose any institute if its marketing is focused on this fundamental. Keep your basics simple. Think what you want from it and focus on its delivery. You are there for education, not to hear its past stories.Institutes focus on this factor to take your attention away from their product. Your focus should only be on their product, their teachers, their teaching methodologies, their course structures, etc.Myth & Mistake-7: Jo Dikhta hai, Wo (Nahi) Bikta haiA good product needs no marketing. Weak products need marketing. Whenever you see lots of marketing effort, Google ads, ATL or BTL, it proves that the product is weak. Strong product does not need for all these advertisements. In the marketing world, out of 4Ps, the product is supreme. Focus on “Product”.Myth & Mistake-8: Marketing Gimmick-CAT/GMAT Toppers as TeachersThis is the most commonly used marketing tool, which has a flawed assumption. Now I am talking more of “Critical Reasoning” language. The flawed assumption is “All Toppers are good Teachers”. Teaching needs a very different skill set. The teaching is to impart knowledge; all toppers cannot be good teachers and all good teachers cannot be toppers.Myth & Mistake-9: Institutes offering Patented Techniques or “Tips & Tricks”All tests require “Hard Work”. If someone can patent “Hard-work”, then this “Gimmick” should be accepted. “Tips & Tricks” are developed with your hard-work. Shortcuts should be evolved and should never be learnt from someone else. Particularly for CAT/GMAT, which is more of an IQ test, “Techniques, Tips & Tricks” should be evolved.Myth & Mistake-10: CAT/GMAT will take me to HarvardThis point is more applicable to business schools taking GMAT as a screening tool.The student’s full profile will work. The CAT/GMAT is a one small part of the profile. Look at all business schools as a family, no family will allow you to be their part till the time they see their values or virtues in you. Every Business school has a distinct positioning and your profile should be positioned in the same way. Profile building is the main work and every person should concentrate on.Myth & Mistake-11: Adopting Toppers StrategiesHear everyone, but adopt none. Every person develops his own ways depending upon his Strengths & Weaknesses or as per his conditions. Good for someone may not be good for you. Hear everyone, but adopt only wisely.Myth & Mistake-12: Practice-More the merrierPractice Better, Not More. The practice should have a direction, running in circles will not help. Do Tests and review. Keep error Logs and keep on practicing. Practice wisely, so that every time you move, you should learn from your past mistakes. Do not overdo the tests.Myth & Mistake-13: Teachers will make me a TopperTeachers show us directions. Unless you practice the topics taught in the class, it will not work. I saw many students thinking that if they spend more time in classes, it will help.Myth & Mistake-14: All tests just needs lot of studying, no need to focus on healthHealthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. I see many students not focusing on their health during exams. Many of the studious people have unhealthy bodies. You need to balance life with at least 7-8 hours’ sleep.Myth & Mistake-15: I do not need any peer groupYou learn more from peers than the teachers. The most important factor will be jealousy. Competition in the group brings the best out of you. I was very fortunate that all others in my group were good. They have already scored more than 700 in prep tests. Every test was like a world war where every one of us wanted to beat everyone else in the group.Myth & Mistake-16: I will study and practice from lot of free materials on netBeware of free materials. There is no free lunch. Some free materials are good, but most of it is crap. The real test is different from the Free tests you see on the net. You will be caught off-guard if you are preparing from the net material.Myth & Mistake-17: Beware from 30-day toppers, 15-day toppersThis is the most common way of advertisement. Become a topper in 30 days or 15 days. It’s hilarious. This is a perfect example of fraud marketing. The CAT/GMAT is an IQ test. Only Asterix magic potion can do it and nothing else.Myth & Mistake-18: You can deceive GMAT Computer Adaptive AlgorithmPlease do not try. GMAC has evolved a test which cannot be deceived. Every question can carry you “Up” and throw you “Down”. Each question is important and has the same value as others do.One more myth is when a student believes that difficult questions carry more marks. And easy questions weightage is low. Do not read too much into any strategy. Work hard and it will show.One more mistake is trying to gauge your performance by counting correct questions out of total. This is the reason why the GMAC computer algorithm is difficult to copy.If you see easy questions, you are not doomed. It does not necessarily mean that your test is not going well.Myth & Mistake-19: Quantitative is important, Engineers have an advantageEngineers do not have any advantage in this test. Rather, they are at a disadvantage because their strength (Quant.) does not have substantial weightage. I have seen many students crossing 700 with 40 in quant and Q40 can be achieved by more than 80% of the test givers.Myth & Mistake-20: I am good in English, verbal will be kids playVerbal is not English, verbal is all about IQ. The only portion of the grammar it touches is SC. But the way CAT/GMAT tests your grammar is more based on IQ rather than grammar rules. SC is more about identifying the wrong choices rather than the correct one. It depends upon how easily you can see 2-3 splits and apply logic to find the correct answer.In CAT/GMAT, there is no perfect answer, you must mark the “Most” correct answer. There might not be any perfect answer in the five choices.Your choices should be based on your experience and how a help will help you cover your shortcomings. I found EduShastra customized approach much better than others. I also found their teachers dedicated to their students.","I'll tell you step by step how you should study to get 99.9 percentile in CAT,now you have around say 11 months to prepare. so CAT exam typically comprises of1.

CAT Exam,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam.

CAT Exam,What are the recommended books/materials for the CAT exam preparation?,https://www.quora.com//What-are-the-recommended-books-materials-for-the-CAT-exam-preparation,"NMAT Preparation, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Book Recommendations",100+,"One of the things that I have seen a lot of CAT aspirants worry about is the books related to CAT preparation. Probably it is natural to get worried about important things in life and CAT preparation is definitely one of the important steps in anyone’s career. Having said that, the choice of books is probably not an important one.There are plenty of great books that are available in the market that you can use and there is very little that separates them. First of all, if you are looking at understanding and application I would much rather recommend that you go ahead with an online coaching course for CAT. It would offer you a lot more than what any book can with the help of videos and live classes for doubt clarification.Having said that, it is also necessary to have some material or the other so that you can practice and eventually improve yourself to solve CAT level questions easily.To be honest, I would recommend that you try out the study material from IMS / TIME / Career Launcher as your first resource. This material is very well designed and keeps the needs of students as the first priority. The slight problem that exists with TIME material, in my opinion, is that sometimes it tends to be a little bit harder than required.You can easily skip out on that particular part of the chapter or those set of problems. However, you should have the knack of knowing what is relevant from a CAT perspective. Once you go through enough number of previous year CAT questions – you will develop that knack. In case you get a doubt regarding the same, you can obviously ask around in some forum. A basic thumb rule could be – can this question be solved from the concepts that you learn in class 10th? If yes – then it is probably relevant for CAT, otherwise, it is not.If it is a Logical Reasoning or Data Interpretation question that is really hard and you look at the solution and it gives you feeling empty headed – there is a very low chance of it getting asked in CAT. Even if it gets asked in CAT, there is a very low chance of most CAT aspirants, including you, solving it during the exam pressure. It is best to learn what to skip during your CAT preparation phase so that you can do it in the main exam as well.Books to avoid for CAT PreparationAs far as books are concerned, let me start with a few books that I do not think are very useful from a CAT preparation perspective.Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis – A brilliant book for building your Vocabulary. This book is probably the best possible way to develop a good vocabulary. The problem, however, with this book is that it is voluminous and bulky. Rarely have I come across a CAT aspirant who has been able to stick to this book for over a month. They start it with full gusto but give up on it in the middle. If building vocabulary is your focus, using some mobile apps is a good idea. The best possible “realistic” way to build a good vocabulary is to read books. Here is a list of recommended books for CAT aspirants.How to Read Better and Faster by Norman Lewis – Once again, a really good book. It is more of a workbook and has a bunch of exercises that can help you improve your reading speed. But perhaps – that is not something that you need. If you have a good reading speed, it helps. But probably it should not be your priority. The length of CAT passages has ranged from 400 words to 1000 words in the past decade. You can also say that it is anywhere from 150-250 words per question.Questions in CAT have rarely been so simple that if you speed-read the passage, you will be able to answer them. You might not need a deep level understanding of the passage but a superficial glance is not going to help you either. You might improve a little bit if you go through the exercises mentioned in the book but I would still recommend that you improve your reading habits rather than improving your reading speed.NCERT Books – I have been guilty of recommending the same to a few students who struggle with the basics of a particular topic. Over time I have realised why this recommendation does not work. The reason is not that these books focus on the wrong concepts. The reason is that they are not required. If you as a student are unable to understand a particular concept, it is not because of the book you are using but it is because you are not able to understand what is given in the book. Probably you need someone to explain it to you. You need someone who can clarify your doubts. The book is not at fault here – you are! I am sorry if this sounds rude. You should stick to your CAT books and study material.High School English Grammar and Composition by Wren and Martin – It is a great book but as the name suggests, you should have read it in high school. The importance of Grammar, sadly, has reduced over the years in CAT. Even earlier, CAT did not mean to test if you knew the definition of a gerund or how it is different from an infinitive. The objective always was to check if you were able to identify the correct sentence or not. Having said that, if you have a good command of English grammar – it will help you in the later stages of Group Discussion and Personal Interview. Most good Business Schools have a ‘Written Ability Test’ to assess your communication skills. Bad grammar at that stage can be a real problem. Once again, reading books (not by Chetan Bhagat) is probably a good way to improve in that area. It would be great if you start blogging. If you write a blog post a week, you would find a remarkable improvement in your grammar in a short time. Learning the rules from Wren and Martin will help you become a good English teacher but I guess that is not what you are aiming for.Some of the books that I think can help you with CAT Preparation are given below. Let me add, you should use these provided you cannot arrange for IMS / TIME / Career Launcher material from somewhere.Books by TMH – Arun SharmaHow to prepare for Quantitative Aptitude for the CAT by Arun Sharma – It is probably the most popular book for Quantitative Aptitude for CAT. It covers all the necessary topics in great detail and has enough number of solved examples as well. The main problem with the book is LOD-3. For those of you who don’t know, this book has exercises divided into three levels. The last level is called ‘Level of Difficulty – 3’ and frankly speaking it is quite useless for most CAT aspirants. The questions in these exercises are a lot harder than what you can expect in CAT. The problem that this creates is that CAT aspirants like to finish a chapter (and they should) before moving on to the next topic. Invariably, they get stuck in a few questions in LOD-3 and give up. If not, they end up wasting a lot of time on stuff that they do not need to know or learn. The benefit of using this popular book is that you can google almost all of the questions and you would find a discussion on the same online. Someone or the other would have discussed it before. There are three more books by TMH / Arun Sharma that you can consider:How to prepare for Data Interpretation for the CAT.How to prepare for Logical Reasoning for the CAT.How to prepare for Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension for the CAT.The set of all four books should cost you around 2500 Rs. I would not recommend that you go in for that. The only book that you should get from this set is the Quant book.Books by Pearson – Nishit SinhaPearson Guide to Quantitative Aptitude for CAT by Nishit Sinha – In my opinion, it is a much better book than the TMH book for the simple reason that it has more problems that are at par with the CAT difficulty level. It also has a lot of extra harder problems but you can and you should skip those. The problem with this book is that even after revisions, it does have some typos and errors. Be that as it may, it is my preferred book recommendation in this category. However, if you decide to go ahead with Nishit Sinha, I would much rather recommend these two books:Pearson Guide to Quantitative Aptitude and Data Interpretation for CAT by Nishit Sinha.Pearson Guide to Verbal Ability and Logical Reasoning for CAT by Nishit Sinha.These two books as a combo would cost you around 1500 Rs. It would be money well spent. While for Quant, it can be debated which is the better book between TMH / Pearson, for LR / DI / RC – Pearson book wins hands down. I especially love the way RC is dealt with in the Pearson books. To be honest, I would have recommended that you go in for The Pearson Complete Guide to CAT that costs around 800 Rs. but the number of printing mistakes/ errors is a bit too high in that one.Books by Arihant PublicationsVerbal Ability and Reading Comprehension by Ajay Singh – It is a pretty good book for Reading Comprehension. It has loads of passages for you to go through. I am often surprised by the lack of popularity of this one. It can be picked up if you are looking at a book specifically for VA and RC.Quantum CAT by Sarvesh Verma – If you already have some coaching institute’s material and are looking for something extra to practice in Quant (I do not agree with this idea but if you are), then probably this is the book that you need to pick up. It covers a large variety of questions and the difficulty level is also maintained. This book does not have the unnecessarily hard questions like most of the other books. Both of these above books are around 700 Rs.Which book(s) to buy for CAT Preparation?Now that I am done with the dispensing of ‘Gyaan’ regarding the books, if you are still confused about which book to buy – let me try and simplify it for you. If you have study material from a coaching institute like IMS / TIME / CL, you should try to finish it from start to end. You should not even look at any other books.If you have study material from a relatively smaller coaching institute like MBA Guru / Total Gadha / Byjus – I have no idea about how good or bad they are. Talk to your faculty – they will give you an unbiased opinion about it. If you want a book just for Quantitative Aptitude – go for Arun Sharma or Quantum CAT. Pick Arun Sharma if are comfortable searching on forums and looking up answers. That will help you learn some more stuff as well.Pick Quantum CAT if you just want to sit with the book and solve. If you want a book just for Verbal Ability – go to the VA / RC book by Arihant (Ajay Singh). If you want a book just for LR / DI / RC – there isn’t something that I can recommend. I don’t think you need a book just for that. Use previous year papers, and previous year mocks, etc. If you want books for everything – go for the two books by Pearson.I hope that all the information given about CAT preparation will help you as you needed. More information on the CAT preparation can be accessed from Getentrance.","First of all i am sharing very useful infographics then i will share best books which helps you to crack CAT Exam in First Attempt.CAT (Common Admission Test) is the entrance exam that is to be given by the aspirants who want to go for MBA (Master of Business Administration) or PGDM (Post Graduate Diploma in Management) from a top reputed college or institute.It is one of the toughest examinations and the competition is also very high due to the high number of students aspiring to get enrolled in reputed business schools to achieve their goals.CAT is an online or computer-based test and consists of three sections namely Quantitative Ability (QA), Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VRC), and Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DI & LR).While preparing for the examination, going for the option of coaching classes is much recommended as they help in understanding the examination and the syllabus with their expertise.

This book explains each topic with solved examples followed by a series of problems with varied difficulty levels to solve which gives an individual enough practice for this section.How to Prepare for Data Interpretation for CAT by Arun SharmaIt covers all the necessary areas of Data Interpretation and Data Sufficiency and also provides the students with previous year’s questions, Model, and Sample test papers. It provides and emphasizes on developing the calculation speed, accuracy and techniques to get an edge with DI.This book is very helpful in learning and memorizing new vocab words as it uses scientific ways with the help of tricks and images. With every word, a trick and image are given so that it is very easy to learn and memorize new words in a short span of time.The students should also solve as many previous year question papers as possible as it will ensure their familiarity with the kind of questions asked in the examination.For this students can consider a book named Previous Years’ Solved CAT Paper. The papers here can be taken as mocks and the analysis of the same can provide you with great insights for your preparation.","One of things that I have seen a lot of CAT aspirants worry about is the books related to CAT preparation. Probably it is natural to get worried about important things in life and CAT preparation is definitely one of the important steps in anyone’s career. Having said that, the choice of books is probably not an important one. There are plenty of great books that are available in the market that you can use and there is very little that separates them. First of all, if you are looking at understanding and application I would much rather recommend that you go ahead with an online coaching course for CAT. It would offer you a lot more than what any book can with the help of videos and live classes for doubt clarification. Having said that, it is also necessary to have some material or the other so that you can practice and eventually improve yourself to solve CAT level questions easily.To be honest, I would recommend that you try out the study material from IMS / TIME / Career Launcher as your first resource. This material is very well designed and keeps the needs of students as the first priority. The slight problem that exists with TIME material, in my opinion, is that sometimes it tends to be a little bit harder than required. You can easily skip out on that particular part of the chapter or those set of problems. However, you should have the knack of knowing what is relevant from a CAT perspective. Once you go through enough number of previous year CAT questions - you will develop that knack. In case you get a doubt regarding the same, you can obviously ask around in some forum. A basic thumb rule could be - can this question be solved from the concepts that you learn in class 10th? If yes - then it is probably relevant for CAT, otherwise it is not. If it is a Logical Reasoning or Data Interpretation question that is really hard and you look at the solution and it gives you feeling empty headed - there is a very low chance of it getting asked in CAT. Even if it gets asked in CAT, there is a very low chance of most CAT aspirants, including you, solving it during the exam pressure. It is best to learn what to skip during your CAT preparation phase, so that you can do it in the main exam as well.Some of the books that I think can help you with CAT Preparation are given below. Let me add, you should use these provided you cannot arrange for IMS / TIME / Career Launcher material from somewhere.Recommended Books / Material for CAT Preparation by TMH - Arun SharmaHow to prepare for Quantitative Aptitude for the CAT by Arun Sharma - It is probably the most popular book for Quantitative Aptitude for CAT. It covers all the necessary topics in great detail and has enough number of solved examples as well. The main problem with the book is LOD-3. For those of you who don’t know, this book has exercises divided in three levels. The last level is called ‘Level of Difficulty - 3’ and frankly speaking it is quite useless for most CAT aspirants. The questions in these exercises are lot harder than what you can expect in CAT. The problem that this creates is that CAT aspirants like to finish a chapter (and they should) before moving on to the next topic. Invariably, they get stuck in a few questions in LOD-3 and give up. If not, they end up wasting a lot of time on stuff that they do not need to know or learn. The benefit of using this popular book is that you can google almost all of the questions and you would find a discussion on the same online. Someone or the other would have discussed it before. There are three more books by TMH / Arun Sharma that you can consider:How to prepare for Data Interpretation for the CATHow to prepare for Logical Reasoning for the CATHow to prepare for Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension for the CATThe set of all four books should cost you around 2500 Rs. I would not recommend that you go in for that. The only book that you should get from this set is the Quant book.Recommended Books / Material for CAT Preparation by Pearson - Nishit SinhaPearson Guide to Quantitative Aptitude for CAT by Nishit Sinha - In my opinion, it is a much better book than the TMH book for the simple reason that it has more problems that are at par with the CAT difficulty level. It also has a lot of extra harder problems but you can and you should skip those. The problem with this book is that even after revisions, it does have some typos and errors. Be that as it may, it is my preferred book recommendation in this category. However, if you decide to go ahead with Nishit Sinha, I would much rather recommend these two books:Pearson Guide to Quantitative Aptitude and Data Intrepretation for CAT by Nishit SinhaPearson Guide to Verbal Ability and Logical Reasoning for CAT by Nishit SinhaThese two books as a combo would cost you around 1500 Rs. It would be money well spent. While for Quant, it can be debated which is the better book between TMH / Pearson, for LR / DI / RC - Pearson book wins hands down. I specially love the way RC is dealt with in the Pearson books. To be honest, I would have recommended that you go in for The Pearson Complete Guide to CAT that costs around 800 Rs. but the number of printing mistakes / errors is a bit too high in that one.Recommended Books / Material for CAT Preparation by Arihant PublicationsVerbal Ability and Reading Comprehension by Ajay Singh - It is a pretty good book for Reading Comprehension. It has loads of passages for you to go through. I am often surprised by the lack of popularity of this one. It can be picked up if you are looking at a book specifically for VA and RC.Quantum CAT by Sarvesh Verma - If you already have some coaching institute’s material and are looking for something extra to practice in Quant (I do not agree with this idea but if you are), then probably this is the book that you need to pick up. It covers a large variety of questions and the difficulty level is also maintained. This book does not have the unnecessarily hard questions like most of the other books.Both of these above books are around 700 Rs.The three books that a large number of teachers / seniors recommend for Verbal Ability improvement are:1. Word Power Made Easy for improving your vocabulary2. Wren and Martin for improving your grammar3. How to Read Better and Faster by Norman Lewis for increasing your reading speed.While all of the above are fantastic books, I personally do not find them much fruitful for most candidates. These often end up being too boring and something that students give up in the middle. How to Read Better and Faster by Normal Lewis might be an exception as it is not voluminous but increasing their reading speed is hardly something that CAT / MBA aspirants should be worried about. You get more than enough time in the CAT exam these days (at least for the last 5 years). The key to high performance lies in understanding the questions and the passages and not rushing through them. Rushing through passages helps if the passages are really simple and you have direct questions on them – it is not the case when it comes to the CAT exam.So, the question then arises as to what should be done to actually improve in it? The answer is simple. You need to go back to the root of the problem. Most CAT aspirants have an issue with Verbal Ability / Reading Comprehension because they don’t really read books regularly. I have been teaching CAT aspirants for a decade now (Yay! – just realized that while typing this post. It will be 10 years in July 2016) and under extremely rare circumstances I have met someone who reads a book a month on average and is struggling with Verbal Ability. As a matter of fact, even if you read 5 books in a year, you should be more or less comfortable when it comes to Verbal Ability. You can and you should directly dive into CAT level problems and you would realize that you are still swimming around in your comfort zone. The problem, however, is for the majority of the CAT aspirants who don’t read regularly and / or the only books that they have read was written by Chetan Bhagat. I will not get into the merits or demerits of reading Bhagat as that would probably become a rather long rang. Be that as it may, if you are in the category of the majority CAT aspirants mentioned above – it is not too late. As a matter of fact, it is never too late. You can and should start reading books, novels, and magazines as soon as possible. Reading newspapers and editorials will also help but there are too many breaks when you read a newspaper and you need to keep shifting from one article to another. There is no ‘FLOW’ That is the reason I strongly recommend that MBA aspirants read as many books as they can during their preparation period. Not only it will help you improve your Verbal Ability, it would open up a whole new world for you.If you are not a regular reader, I would suggest that you start with something simple and easy and then move on to books which are slightly harder to read. Some easy to read books that can start with and they would also motivate you.Recommended Books in Fiction (Simple)Old Man and the SeaThe AlchemistHarry Potter (Series)Sherlock Holmes (Series)Lord of the FliesCatch-22Animal Farm1984Brave New WorldTrain to PakistanSlaughterhouse 5Once you are done with the above list, or may be even half of it, probably you should try out another list that is slightly harder.Recommended Books in Fiction / Non-FictionDealing with Indian issuesThe Great Indian NovelIndia after GandhiMidnight’s ChildrenArgumentative IndianThe Last MughalDealing with global issues and economics / management:The Selfish GeneGuns, Germs, and SteelThe World is FlatFreakonomicsTipping PointThe Black SwanThinking Fast & SlowI am personally not a big fan of biographies / autobiographies but there are a few that you can give a try.Losing My VirginityStraight from the GutSteve Jobs (Walter Issacson)IacoccaBusiness MaharajasBanker to the PoorI am sure I have missed out on many great ideas but I am also sure that if you try and go through even half of the books mentioned above, you would significantly improve not only your Verbal Ability but also your chances in the Group Discussion / Personal Interview stage. These books will open your mind and expand your horizons. Do not think of it as a task that you need to do to increase your chances at cracking CAT, but think of it as something that will make you a better person.If you are looking at something little more comprehensive than books to prepare, do look for online courses. My online course for CAT prep is available here: Online CAT Coaching Classes | CAT 2016 Coaching | CAT Preparation","First of all, get CAT preparation material of some good coaching institute.For Quant, there are two good books- Arun Sharma & Sarvesh Varma. You can refer to any of these. I referred the latter one as suggested by one of my friends. However, I think the former is more popular with the students. Both the books are good. But don’t buy both. No need to unnecessary collect a lot of books & material. If you have limited time, solving one book is enough. Go for the second book only when you have finished the entire syllabus.Quantitative Aptitude:::Most problems in CAT/GMAT are actually meant to test your ability to look at a complex scenario and find simple solutions to it. You are wannabe managers, right ? A manager is not somebody who is a mathematical genius, but somebody who is proficient at efficient utilization of resources. In most problems, a bulk of calculation can be avoided by using logical arguments. This is the best way to speed up calculations – avoid the need for calculations. Before rushing on to make a calculation – stop to see if there are logical explanations that can resolve things to a great degree ? You will be surprised, that in most cases, this actually turns out to be so. The questions for these examinations are carefully crafted not to test whether you can find a cube-root, but to find out whether you can find the inherent patterns in the problem and reveal the underlying simplicity. Refer to these books for practise-How to Prepare for Quantitative Aptitude for CAT by Arun SharmaQuantum CAT by Sarvesh VermaPearson Guide for Quantitative AptitudeData Interpretation & Logical Reasoning :::Don’t get overawed by the sheer size of the table in the CAT paper. They are just a tool to frighten you. Like in comprehension, read the question before scanning the data. This will help you avoid fighting with and filtering useless data. Instead of doing exact calculation try approximation, while solving this section. All your hard work during Maths preparation will help you in approximation. If you have good grasp of the concept you can develop your own short cuts and you would never need to memorise them. Try to avoid using pen and paper while solving this section. Once the examiner forces you to use pen and paper then he succeeds in trapping you in the maze of endless calculation which is known as mathematics. Consider the following books for practise -Logical Reasoning for the CAT by Nishit K. SinhaHow to Prepare for Logical Reasoning for the CAT by Arun SharmaHow to Prepare for Data Interpretation for the Cat by Arun SharmaVerbal Ability and Reading comprehension :::Read the editorial sections of popular newspapers like the Hindu. Additionally, refer to he following books -How to Prepare for Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension for the CAT by Arun SharmaVerbal Ability & Comprehension by Aditya ChoudharyVocabulary , Grammar :::Word Power Made Easy Book by Norman Lewis30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary by Norman LewisWren and Martin High School GrammarPractice Papers:::First complete all the material mentioned above, and solve questions from indiabix and cracku websites.Other than that, consider the following set for practising additional problems.CAT Topic Wise Solved PapersThere is sufficient simplicity in each problem, waiting to reveal itself. Don’t insult the beauty by ignoring it and rushing past through it. Stop. Relax. Enjoy the beauty and your journey will be much simpler"
CAT Exam,How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-did-99+-percentilers-prepare-for-CAT,"Prepathon, Exam and Test Results, Common Admission Test Percentiles, Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",100+,"My authority on the subject? I scored a 99.75 percentile in CAT, 99.55 in XAT, 99.45 in SNAP. This is a walkthrough of my preparation/ how you can go about preparing for CAT and other entrance exams.CAT is considered to be one of the most difficult entrance exams in India, but it is isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most of the topics that are tested in CAT are High school level topics. The difficulty lies in the fear of the test. Most CAT aspirants resign to an assumption that they can’t score above a certain percentile without even knowing what the test is made off, half the game is lost at this point.I have been guilty of the same myself. Jan 2016, I remember looking at lists of MBA colleges and immediately rejecting the top 30 odd colleges for the fact that they all required you to score above 97 percentile or so to realistically make into those colleges. It was only when I talked to my father and he explained to me the negativity in my thinking, that I realised, I hadn’t even seen what CAT consisted of. I had no logic in leaving out the possibility of scoring an extremely high percentile.Another reason why I felt that I had to score an extremely high percentile were my 12th class marks. MBA colleges give weightage to academic profile. A self-analysis made me realise that having a low score in my 12th class (69%) was a huge handicap. If I had got a low percentile I would’ve found it extremely difficult to make into the colleges of the relevant level. I would’ve ended up in colleges ranked even lower. I had to score a 99+ percentile. BELIEVE you can Crack the CATHow to go about:I have divided the preparation for CAT into four parts:Pre-preparation, Preparation, Practice, Taking the CATPre-PreparationThere are a few things you’ll want to have in place before you start your preparation for CAT and other exams.Find three hours a day (not in bits and pieces here and there) three continuous hours to prepare. This can be extremely difficult if you are working/ attending college. This might help you to find a few extra hours a day.Get rid of any distractions that you believe affect your concentration or mental state in general. (social media is one of the biggest time-suck and tends to distract you even if you aren’t online)Get in touch with someone who has cracked the entrance exam or has some expertise in the same, you could approach a local coaching centre. (you may not enrol as a full-time student but you would want to be in touch with the faculty there by buying their material or tests etc.) This will be helpful in getting certain finner tips and in case you have difficulties.Get yourself a campaign manager. Cracking the CAT and getting an admission into an MBA college is a long drawn process. You are bound to lose interest or forget important things/ deadlines. Get someone who will keep track of the same. For me, it was my father who helped me keep track of my preparation and all the college applications. Make sure the person you chose exactly understands the process and understands what you want. They will make sure that you are still going even when the motivation starts to run out.Read a lot. This is extremely important when it comes to the verbal ability section of CAT. You will need a lot of broad-based readings and an ability to make sense of what you have read quickly. The passages for reading comprehension in CAT are sometimes extremely abstract and can be extremely difficult to make sense if you aren’t used to reading a lot. Places where you should want to read from: Medium, The guardian, Businessweek Bloomberg, Also read some classic novels that you can lay your hands on, the books talked about on crash course literature are a good place to start.PreparationCAT is divided into 3 sections verbal ability reading comprehension, logical reasoning data interpretation, and quantitative ability. Each of the sections requires equal effort and attention.Time for preparation: There are many people and sites who will tell you that you need 14 hours a day to prepare for CAT. Trust me that doesn’t work. You just need 3 to 4 hours a day consistently over a period of 3- 4 months to crack CAT. Anything more than 5 hours a day can and will burn you out.Source material for preparation: A common mistake that most aspirants will make is relying on just one book/ one source for preparation (particularly anyone who takes coaching). It is recommended that you have access to at least some material from different authors. This will provide you with multiple points of view for the same problems. (same goes for mock tests recommended that take at least 4 to 5 tests from A differen source).Verbal Ability & Reading ComprehensionThis is one of the most frustrating sections in CAT. The question often can seem to have multiple solutions and where options are provided all of them seem correct. Even if you are extremely good with English you can end up messing this section.The key to cracking this section (particularly Verbal ability part) is understanding that this section is more about logic than language. You have to understand the logic as to how the solutions are arrived at (jumbled para is the killer in this section).I initially worked this section by looking at the solutions, that way I was able to see what patterns to look out for and what logic to apply.Work on improving your ability to comprehend complex /long sentences, particularly from topics that you aren’t used to and having complex vocabulary.This section will take a lot of practice to master, more practice than the other two sections. This section has the highest returns for scores. If you get a slightly higher score in this section your percentile can increase drastically. (I scored a 99.98 percentile in this section).Even if you have a good command over the language DO NOT take this section lightly, I know of aspirants who have the CAT along with me having excellent command over the language yet messing up this section completely.Data interpretation and logical reasoningData interpretation is a practice intensive section. There is nothing new that you have to learn in this section. It is just the ability to carry out basic calculations using tools you already have (percentages, averages, summation, division). Practice these basic tools thoroughly so that you are extremely comfortable with them. Also get acquainted with all the various forms of data presentation, such as graphs, pie charts, tables, caselets etc.Logical reasoning is a section which you should and can make the most out of it. The questions are very often similar. While practising logical reasoning the things you would want to learn is gauging the difficulty of the question quickly. If a question is difficult, move on to the next one (time is important).You would want to practice visualising the problem (in mind / on paper ) in the simplest way possible. This will help you breakdown huge paragraphs full of seemingly meaningless words into sensible data.Learn to have an unbiased mind. One of the mistakes you can make in this section is assume somehting that isnt true. Learn to use all the information provided and only than make any conclusion.Read the data carefully a single word can change the whole situation. (for ex. XYZ is not wearing a black pant. can easily be mistaken for XYZ wearing a pant if you miss out on the not.)Quantitative abilityThis is one of the more easier sections to get by, You just have to understand the concepts behind all the topics involved. Again the topics in this section are high school level math. You can over prepare for this section and most aspirants do.There are certain topics in this section that you would want to be extremely thorough with since they appear most frequently (going by the trends of past so many years), such as time speed distance, time work, Geometry, Functions.You would want to also be thorough with averages alligations, percentages ratios since these topics are more helpful in DI section but very rarely make an appearance as stand-alone questions in QA section.Number systems personally I felt for me was an extremely overrated topic ( I spent way more time than required here)PracticeTaking mock tests, I feel mock tests will be the most important part of your preparation as they help you guage exactly where you stand. (another benefit is to know which colleges you should apply to).What is a good number of mock tests to take? There isn’t any concensus on this topic, there are CAT toppers who got by on hardly any mock tests, and than there are people like me who took close 40 mock tests.Personally mock tests where the biggest source of practice for me. I took mock tests from 3 different sources. ( I recommend atleast 2 different sources). Once you have taken a mock test it’s extremely important that you analyse them well, I spent about an hour and half after every mock test to analyse where I have gone wrong and what can be changed. Mock tests are also a good time to test out strategies in handling various sections. (I will try to come with a detailed post about analysing mock tests.)I will boast a little here, but thanks to the trends on my mock tests I was extremely confident of getting the percentile I got on CAT. ( I expected at least a 99.5 %le)I recommend practicing during the time slot you will actually be answering the CAT, I had to take the CAT on a sunday in the morning slot (9.30 to 12.30) at a centre 30 kms away from home. Considering the reporting time of an extra hour, I would have to technically leave my house at 7 in the morning on the day of the test. I usually get hungry within 2 and half hours of eating anything. So in the month before CAT I trained my body, by having breakfast at 6 in the morning and not having anything till 1pm. I also trained myself to sit at one place for 4 hours (830 to 1230). This may seem funny/ unnecessary but on the day of the test you dont want to have any other factors troubling you.Taking the CATTry to stop preparation for CAT at least 3 days before CAT (there are people who will disagree and reccommend you remain in the mood and keep preparing) anything you try to “prepare” during these last days often will be of very little help. Don’t wander away from the CAT mood though, read or at least make sure you are sitting 3 hours at a place for these last few days ( to stay in the CAT mood).Do not take a mock test in the few days before CAT, If you mess the mock it is likely that you will panic on the day of the CAT.Do not keep any expectations as to the number of questions you want to complete in each section.All the best for your preparation for CAT.P.S. CAT isn’t everything, CAT is hardly a learning experience, you won’t learn anything new as such (well other than how to prepare hard) it’s mostly about things you already know, taking the CAT can hence be a very frustrating experience. I recommend that you learn something else too on the side lines, get a hobby or hold a job (again debatable as to how much time you can find etc.) If you are taking drop read a lot, read all the books you can get your hands on. All in all try to do something else too that will help you grow.Belling the CAT and other entrance exams","This answer is fairly long, about 7000 words. So I have divided my answer into 9 parts wherein each part can be read independently. However reading the entire answer in one go will serve as RC practice, so that would be advisable.What I have mentioned below helped me in my journey from 66% -> 99.85% in CAT. I have tried my level best to be as detailed as possible. GK as a section is not there in CAT as of now but is very important in the other papers like XAT, IIFT, SNAP, etc. So, I have included that as well. I have also put in a little bit about how to attempt mocks and then analyse them to improve further. A little bit on GD-PI-WAT as well, so that this answer serves all your needs.I would like to point out that I have been an average student all my life and am a GEM (General Engineer Male), yes pun intended. My 10/12/B.Tech scores are 83/79/66. With that I made it to IIM Calcutta, so the first thing that you should now do is stop worrying about your previous grades. 99% of the people reading this will surely have better grades. So, if I can you obviously can get through and study at an IIM.My CAT 2015 score card:QA: 99.8%LRDI: 99.96%VA: 87.33%OA: 99.85%This answer is divided into the following parts:A.) How to start?B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityC.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningD.) VA -> Verbal AbilityE.) GK -> General KnowledgeF.) How to attempt mocks? (Non-CAT exams at the end)G.) How to analyse mocks?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?I.) GD-PI-WAT prepA.) How to start CAT prep?Register at any site which lets you attempt and review a mock for free. You could try hitbullseye. If you have already enrolled for a test series or for a classroom programme, then attempt one of their mocks. Many of you would be like bhai abhi toh padhai start bhi nahi ki, mock deke kya hoga aur upar se aadhe questions toh samajh bhi nahi aayenge aur maths ke formula bhi yaad nahi hain. Additionally while attempting the mock, there will be multiple instances when you will feel like getting up because you are not used to solving questions for 3 hours at a stretch. Your brain will also try to deceive you into grabbing your smart phone for checking Whatsapp. You will feel like drinking water, you will also be tempted to check FB. The point of this test is to make sure that all this doesn’t happen when you actually attempt CAT. Now you would be thinking what is the point in attempting a mock when I don’t know $hi+.Precisely my point! The main reason for this mock was to identify what you know, what you don’t, where you stand and how much hard work is required.Once you are done with the mock, check the solutions and find the topics which you already know, which you attempted correctly. Some problems would have been there which you would have been sure of but you got them wrong because you were out of touch and forgot the formula or recalled an incorrect formula. You probably forgot the plural of fish. Fish or fishes? Or does it depend on whether I am talking about a species of fish or multiple units of the same species? Then you will realise that a little brush up of a few topics (which you are out of touch with) will dramatically improve your score. Work on these topics first and then move on to topics which you have no clue about. This mock decides your future course of study.Now, on to the preparation phase.B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityStart off with this site. http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/Click on start and then check your score. You know where you stand. Keep practising a few times every day and your score will keep improving. If you can hit 50-55 consistently in the default 120 seconds, you will easily hit 99.5% in CAT in this section. If you are targeting 99.5+ then I would also like you to memorise the following:B1.) Reciprocals, Squares and Cubes up till 30. Pay attention here, some values will get repeated. As for 1/7. Remember that it is .142857. For other go up to 2-3 decimals,whatever you are comfortable with. I would prefer 3 decimals though.B2.) Power of 2 up till 12Power of 3 up till 8Power of 4 up till 6Power of 5-6 up till 5Power of 7-10 up till 4Power of 11-13 up till 3Again same as above. Some values will be the same. 4^6 has already been covered till 2^12 and so on. Don’t just mug up blindly, pay attention to the numbers.B3.) Square Root up till 10B4.) Factorial up till 10B1-B4: Now most of you would be like, dude they give an inbuilt calculator. But then other exams don’t have that calculator. Additionally who do you think will take lesser time in solving a question? A person who uses the calculator for finding 12^3 or someone who just knows it is 1728. Believe me when I say that this is very important for your LRDI section as well. This will decide whether you get stuck at 99.5% or go beyond that. This is the deciding factor. Please memorise these values.B5.) A few important numbers like 999=27*37, 1001=7*11*13, 21^3=9261.B6.) Some numbers have the property wherein the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the no itself. 1, 2, 145 and 40585. Please remember these.B7.) There are 15 primes till 50, 25 till 100, 46 till 200 and 168 till 1000.B8.) How to find the sum of the first n natural nos. Sum of squares of n natural nos. Sum of cubes, sum of 4th powers. Please remember the formulas. Specially the last one (fourth power), most people forget that.B9.) Scale is not allowed in any of the exams. What the CAT authorities mean is that the scale which we used back in school that is not allowed. They never said anything about using your hand as a scale. Check the length of your fingers. Also check the length of the 3 sub division on your fingers. Use your right or left hand, whatever suits you. Please make sure that you remember these values by heart. These values will help you solve 90% of the geometry questions. Also, buy a protractor and make sure you can make the angles 30, 45, 60, 90 properly. First with the protractor and then without it. Based on the question, make a rough figure. Then based on your lengths, find the answer and then scale up to the value given in the question. Geometry has a lot of formulas, memorize them or use this approach. Approximation ftw!B.10.) Unitary Method. Make sure you are good with this, half the QA syllabus can be solved using unitary method. Do you think whatever has been mentioned in B9 is basically Unitary Method at the end for getting the answer?Most of the students go for solving the maximum no of problems. Don’t do that. Focus on the basics, don't go for solving questions directly like most students. Most students don’t score 99+. You are different, work differently. This is how you should be doing it for any given chapter day wise. First day go after the formulas and try to understand why a certain formula is there. Make sure that you have memorised all the formulas for that chapter. If you were to set the paper, what could be a possible question? Read a formula, try to frame questions on that formula and then memorize the formula. Just memorizing all formulas in one go won't help, because you will probably forget. If you can do this, then you would have solved all the questions by the time you finish reading the theory.Example: Let's say you are studying Numbers. You see the formulas for HCF and LCM of 2 nos. Then you see the factors of a number. Now think of possible questions on this. Let's say 72.1.) How many odd factors are there?2.) How many even factors are there?3.) What is the sum of the odd factors?4.) What is the sum of the even factors?5.) What is the product of the odd factors?6.) What is the product of the even factors?7.) How many factors are squares of natural numbers?8.) How many factors are cubes of natural numbers?Good going, you just completed half the chapter! Similarly think of more questions that you can make. The exercise at the end is filled with such questions. It depends on your thinking. Focus on this. If basics are fine,questions won't be a problem.Would you memorize 456*876 and 235*9865 and things like that or learn how multiplication works?If you think that you lack imagination when it comes to maths and can’t do the above, then no problem. As mentioned above, by the end of the first day you would be done with memorising all the formulas. That’s it. Don’t solve anything. Just make sure all the formulas are deeply rooted in your brain and you can recall them anytime you want. Now take a break for a day. On the 3rd day, start solving problems. But remember that you are to solve by recalling the formula not by turning over the pages and looking at the formula. If you cannot recall, then please make sure you memorize the formulas again. Solve a few problems. Take a day’s break and continue solving on the 5th and similarly on the 7th day as well. This way apart from the formula getting imprinted in your brain multiple times, you will also understand which formulas are asked more often than others. Some chapters are connected to one another. Make groups of such chapters. If working on a group, try to complete all the topics in that group. For example:Ratio Proportion, Unitary Method, Percentage, Profit and Loss.Simple equations, Simultaneous equations, Inequalities, Time speed distance and work, Quadratic.Progression.Numbers, Bases, Miscellaneous equations.Surds and Indices, Logarithms.Mensuration.Geometry.Coordinate Geometry.Probability and PnC.Functions and Graphs.For people trying to clear the cut off in this section. The first 3 with mensuration and a bit of geometry/numbers will be enough.C.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningData Interpretation is speed and practise. The site mentioned in the Quant region and B1-B4 there would be of immense help. These will increase your speed. Generally each and every DI set has at least a problem on percentage or ratio.Today when you start, start off with the sole intention of solving all the questions of a given set. When you can do that on a daily basis. Move to 2 sets a day. When you can do that. Move to 3 sets daily and then to 4 sets. Keep solving as many questions as you can. Time taken per question will decrease with practise. A few months after you were born, you started to crawl, then you started walking and finally you started running. Same thing here. Don’t think about speed now. Speed comes gradually. Let nature take its course.Logical Reasoning, as the name suggests is based on how well you can interpret and analyse things. LR checks your thought process, it checks how you tackle problems. Get this book ""Puzzles"" by George J. Summers. When you watch a football match, why do you watch it? Probably because you want your team to win or you want to see a good contest and enjoy. Similarly, once you have bought this book, think about your objective. It’s not about getting the correct solution, it’s about improving your thought process. And additionally the puzzles in this book are tough. You could think of it as the daddy of Irodov. Engineers will get the joke! You won’t be able to solve most of the problems and frankly speaking I don’t expect you to. However, what I do expect from you is to read a question. Try to understand what has been given. Try to understand what is being asked. Think about it for say 10-15 minutes. Write down whatever approach you can think of. If you could not solve it, look at the hints and their solution scheme. Were you thinking in the right direction?Analyse the difference between the method given in the book and your method.Try to understand what you missed because of which you could not solve the puzzle. Try again for 30 minutes. If you can solve it, good enough, if not maybe try again. After a few more tries look at the solution. Remember you bought the book to improve your thought process, not to solve each question in the first attempt. Trying a puzzle for 5 minutes and then looking at the solution will take you nowhere. Solving again and again till the time you get the answer is what the book was bought for. To make sure that you can think and get the answer on your own. The answer at the end is just for verification. 1-2 puzzles a day. 3 at max, not more than that. You have to improve your thought process,not complete the book as fast as possible. Your scores in the LR section will improve in a month’s time and then it will stay at 99%.Another very important point would be to memorize the alphabet-number conversion table. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. You will come across questions on this in your mocks as well as in the exams.D.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI had 69 and 72 in English in 10 and 12 respectively. My verbal score in CAT went up from 43 -> 87%. Whatever I have written below is what I did to make sure that I cleared the verbal cut off comfortably. If you are looking at a 99+verbal score, then you would be better off by reading the other answers to this question for improving your verbal section. This part is not for you kindly move on to the LRDI section. If you however $uck at English just like me, then this just might help you in clearing the sectional cut off. I tried memorizing words from the GRE word list. My language skills were not good enough to use words like persiflage, perspicuous, ubiquitous, scintillating, etc. in sentences. So, I would keep memorizing and then keep forgetting these words. I had never read novels so I had never come across such words as well. So, I came to the conclusion that memorising words won’t help me. But, a decent vocabulary is needed for CAT. So, I bought this book “Word Power Made Easy” by Normal Lewis. Managed to complete the chapters in a few months. I didn’t do the word list at the end. I would request you to buy this book and complete the chapters.Another thing that seemed obvious to me was that whether you look at RCs or Para Jumbles or Para Completion or Para Summary. All these have basically been written by some person who had a very good command over the English language. So all these things should logically have a flow of thought with which the author would have written the entire thing. You just have to understand that flow. If you can understand an RC, then understanding a paragraph from that RC will obviously be very easy for you. Think about it, a PJ or a PC or a PS are basically paragraphs taken from an RC. You just have to understand the flow in which the entire thing was written by some person who had a decent understanding of the English language. But, then I again had a problem. The Verbal section in CAT was supposed to be of 1 hour and as soon as I would start reading an RC, 8-10 minutes down the line I would feel drowsy. I would start thinking about checking FB or Whatsapp or practically doing anything apart from reading that stupid RC. All those Speed reading techniques, skimming, reading the question first and all. None of that mattered. I understood what my problem was. COMPREHENSION and CONCENTRATION. By the time I was in the 2nd para I would have forgotten what was written in the 1st para. It’s called a READING COMPREHENSION for a reason. Never trade comprehension for speed.How to improve comprehension and concentration?Both will improve gradually with time. First step is to make sure that you don’t feel drowsy when reading for an hour. You will be required to do that in the exam. So you need to build your stamina to concentrate. Start off by reading 2-3k word long articles on News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian. Register on the website and you will get a mail every morning at 10am. Read all the articles from there. Make sure you read at a stretch for an hour. Read everything from Culture to Technology to Art to Literature. In the beginning you will feel sleepy within a few minutes of starting. Slowly you will gain rhythm. Within 15 days you will be able to read 1 hour at a stretch. In a month’s time you will start retaining information as well. Then focus on just 1 category every day. Like only Philosophy or only Art or only culture. With that your stamina and concentration will increase further and since you are reading about only 1 thing for 1 hour, your knowledge in that topic will also increase. This can be done at home, but preferably in office to better utilize your time. PJ PC PS are all extensions of an RC. All will seem easy once you are comfortable with RCs. Here News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian you will be reading 2000-3000 word long articles. Once you are used to this, 500-600 word passages in CAT and other exams will be a piece of cake for you!For verbal, always eliminate choices and then mark rather than directly trying to find the correct answer. This section is different from the other sections,so it has to be dealt in a different manner. Please eliminate choices and then answer. If in doubt, leave. As for the grammar section, I have no idea when to use have and when to use has. Same with is/are and things like that. Neither can I spot grammatical errors in sentences. So, I mostly leave such questions.But I always read them. You can always answer a few of them based on instinct. Some sitters are always there in every paper.E.) GK -> General KnowledgeAll the papers except CAT have this section. Some have a sectional cut off,some don’t. This section can be answered in about 5 minutes. It has the highest marks/min for any section. This section is the key to a high percentile. This section will give you the points for speaking in a GD and PI and also for writing in WAT. So, if you plan on getting through to a good B-School don’t ignore it. There would be 2 methods to prepare for this.E1.) Start reading any newspaper. Go through the headlines and all. Make sure you are updated with what is happening in the country. After a week or so, you will realise that it’s mostly the same thing that keeps getting repeated everyday in the paper. Think of it from the point of view of the exam. There will be MCQs. So they won’t ask for your opinion on Kejriwal vs Modi. Leave all the pages on politics. That’s sheer wastage of time. Don’t waste time on that stuff! Make sure you remember the schemes which Mr Modi keeps rolling out. At least remember the important ones. Did any big firm buy another one? Any Indian who won some award abroad. Who won which Grand Slam? Who won the Pulitzer Prize? Who won the Arjuna Khel Ratna Award? India is working on the Chabahar port with which country? Malcom Turnbull is from which country? I think you would have understood what is expected from you. MBA is about business. Focus on economic and business news more than others. Noble Prize in economics fort his year? How many Deputy Governors are there in the Reserve Bank? Make a doc file with these details. You file would look somewhat like this.https://docs.google.com/document...This is what I had made for this year, so no this won’t help you! You will have to make one with the current affairs of this year. Since you will be working the entire year making this, so by the time the exams are a week away, you will have such a file. You might however think that this is too much work. In that case I would suggest you try the second and relatively easier method compared to this.E2.) Whichever is the first exam for you which will have a GK section, keep 4 days before that exam for making this file and memorizing it. Gather all the monthly booklets which are given to Time students. Each book has about 100 questions. Memorize the ones you think are important. CL and Time both will also have a few sheets on GK, current affairs, etc. Get those as well. CL GK compendium. Hitbullseye gk pdfs are also there. You can get most of these online for free or search on Pagalguy, someone would have uploaded it there for sure. Whatever you think is important, please memorize that. 4 days is more than enough to complete all the material I have mentioned above. By going through the monthly magazines you will also be able to keep track of what is happening in India and also round the globe.The regular reading (The first method, reading daily) means that when the exam sare about to start, you would have completed most of the things. The last 4 days will serve as a revision for you. I did both the above things. So if you have time go for it. A close friend of mine, Prateek, he was preparing for UPSC. He was of immense help! Whenever I would meet him, we would talk about how things going on in our country. Served as revision for him and I would stay updated with facts. So, if you can find someone who is preparing for UPSC religiously,i t would be great. You will also have a contact who is an IAS officer. If you want to score even higher in GK get a small yearbook from some shop. Small ones general contain 100 odd pages, going through that will serve as revision as well.F.) How to attempt mocks (Non-CAT exams at the end)The first step here is to make sure that you can sit and concentrate properly for 3 hours at a stretch. FB, Whatsapp, drowsiness, drinking water or the sudden urge to go to the washroom during these 3 hours have to be removed.Kindly take care of such things which might disturb you, especially the last 2 and then start a mock. When you are attempting the mock, the only thing in your mind should be about maximising your score! Another point that you should keep in mind in that no one cares about what you know and what you don’t. The only thing that matters is your score. So please keep your ego aside when attempting the paper. Yeh question kaise nahi bana, kal hi toh banaya tha and then you spend the next 15 mins on it and still end up marking the wrong answer. Please don’t! You have a fight with your girlfriend and then you are like “I am not texting her first”. Yes I was talking about that very ego of yours, please get rid of it when you are attempting a mock. If you can’t solve a question then please move on to the next one. The examination hall is not the place to derive a formula and then solve the concerned problem. Anyways, I could go on but I think I have made my point.Remember that half the paper is very easy, mostly formula based. Your approach should be to attempt these questions first. Make sure that you have touched the 97-98% mark and then move on to the difficult questions for improving your score.F1.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityYou are not supposed to start from question no 1 and then continue till 34. Most of the times you will not even be able to look at some of the problems in the end. So we will follow a Round by round approach. About 50% of the problems are direct formula based. When you start this section (Round 1), keep the above point in mind. So, as soon as you look at a question. Can you solve it in a minute by using a formula? If the question with a formula was given to a 5th grader, would he be able to solve it. If yes, then solve this question. Use the values given in the question, get the answer and then move on to the next question. If you see a question and you are like, yaar yeh toh banaya hua hai, 2-3 min lagega, lamba question hai. Or if you are like sirf cases likhne hain, phir count kar lunga, phir answer. Such questions which you know you can solve but are not direct formula based, are to be left out now. These have to be attempted in the 2nd round. Getting my point? If formula based, then attempt else next. Within 30 minutes you should have attempted about 16-17 questions and you would have seen all the questions. That will get you at least 97-98% in this section.Now Round 2, there were a few questions which you had seen earlier and were pretty confident about. This is where your brain will help you. The human mind is so awesome that even though you just looked at it once but solved different questions and totally forgot about it, you brain was working on that question subconsciously without you having any idea about it. Now, when you read the question, you will take a lesser amount of time to solve it compared to what you would have taken had you solved it in the first round itself. You could go for Round 3 as well, your choice! But 2 rounds are needed. Please stop with a single round method which most of you are used to now.Why this approach?Many people are most often not able to see the entire paper,so they miss sitters. This round by round technique helps you go through the entire paper and thereby select the easiest ones which in turn maximises your score. You won’t get a prize if you solve a question that only 10 students out of 2 lac could solve. The marks per question is the same. Since you solve the easier problems first, the chances of your committing mistakes goes down considerably. A question which you have solved but incorrectly is not wasted time and only a -1 for your score. Instead of 3 you get a -1. So such a question effectively hits you with lost time and a -4. This method reduces the no of such questions. Hence, this approach.F2.) DILR -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningIf you have tried solving the book which I had mentioned above, you would by now have a fair idea about how to make a table for solving LR problems. 5 people, 5 countries, 5 cars, 5 pets. All of us have solved such puzzles,haven’t we? You would obviously have 4 columns but which would be the first and which would be the second, etc. That determines how fast you will be able to solve the set. Oh, you thought it didn’t make a difference? It does! Sometimes you are better off soling set theory problems by a table. This is where your practise and experience comes into play. Making the proper table means half the work is done then and there. You just have to put in the values and tick mark the correct answers now.Now about how to attempt. When you start the section, go through the 4 LR sets.1-2 sets will be very easy. Take a couple of minutes and try to identify the easier ones. Look at the questions. Do you see any question wherein it asks how many cases are possible or questions of that sort? Such sets are to be solved at the end. Look for sets wherein directly by looking at the questions, you know that there is one unique solution. Use the answer options to further reduce your time for soling that set. Now start with such sets. First advantage of this method will be that you will feel good, because you will be done with a couple of sets in 10-12 minutes. Additionally you will be in a flow and your chances of cracking a difficult set will go up. Now compare this to the case when you start the section, and think that looking at all the questions means losing a few minutes. I am James Bond, so I will start with the first set. 10 minutes later you haven’t completed a single question and now for the remaining 50 minutes you will keep thinking, yaar 10 min faaltu mein barbaad ho gaye. Good luck solving that section and the next with such a mind-set.Many a time it will happen that the set you picked up, is going nowhere and yet time is passing on. For such sets, wherein you have already spent 4-5 minutes but haven’t been able to mark even a single question. Please leave that set.You might be tempted to think sirf 2 min aur, aur phir 4 questions ban jayenge. Please don’t commit that mistake. 5 minutes is the threshold in which you should have been able to mark at least 2 questions. Worst case scenario 1. If you are at 0. Please move on. You are better off solving that set later on,preferably at home!Same with DI sets, go through the sets, select the easier ones, and complete them. You will be left off with 2 sets. Again with 2 options, it always easy to select the easier one. This way most of the times, you will end up solving the toughest set at the end or you will probably leave it. All questions have the same marks, so isn’t it better to solve easier ones? Additionally tougher problems will also take a toll on your brain, your effectiveness for the next section might go down. Do you want that to happen?Sometimes a set will be easy but a question in there will be extremely tough.Beware of such questions, these are put in place to derail your momentum. 5-7 minutes per set is what you should be looking at. Always look at the questions and attempt. You don’t have to attempt all questions from a set. Even 3 attempts for a set is fine. Again, you know the term that I am talking about!Keep that aside when attempting a mock.F3.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI get tired of reading and lose interest quickly. So RCs at the end seems a bad idea. So, I start off with RCs. Again as soon as you start this section. Glance through all the RCs in a minute and check if any of them is from a subject you like. Your reading speed and comprehension will be higher in this case. Again as mentioned above, just because you read an RC, doesn’t mean you have to attempt all the questions. Even 4 out of 6 questions from an RC is good enough. Just attempting for the sake of increasing attempts is sheer stupidity. Please don’t think ki aree yaar itne marks toh already aa hi rahe hain exam mein. Dusron ko thoda mauka de deta hun -2 leke. Please don’t do that. Eliminate options and then attempt. When in doubt leave. Move on to the single questions after the RCs.Note -> For non-CAT mocks which you attempt online.First and foremost thing is that apart from CAT, most are pen paper based, but at home you attempt online papers for these. Take a few print outs of the OMR sheet and check how many minutes you need for marking the answers. Keep a 5 min buffer for your safety. Let’s say we talk about IIFT. It’s a 2 hour paper in real. However I need 20 minutes just for marking the bubbles. So, there is absolutely no point in attempting the online paper at home for 2 hrs. Submit the test after 100 minutes. Don’t worry if people attempt for 2 hours and your rank is low. Your score in the main exam matters, not in this one. Similarly for SNAP and XAT as well. Form a basic strategy of how you would like to attempt the paper for the 100 minutes(whatever your time is after you have checked marking in the OMR sheet). Like for Snap, I had a strategy of 5-6 minutes for gk then 16-18 minutes for verbal, then 35-40 minutes for LR. Then maths and as soon as it would be 90 minutes after the start, I would mark all the answers. Then solve and again mark in the last 5 minutes. Similarly make your strategy for IIFT, SNAP, XAT, etc. and stick to it.G.) How to analyse mock?The instant you submit a mock, you will have a score in mind, itna toh banta hai. 1 sec later the page reloads and you see your score and you go, are yaar itne toh 2 section milake hi aa jane chahiye the. This is why analysing the mock is important. You knew a certain score was achievable but your score went down drastically because of silly mistakes. Analysing mocks will take care of such mistakes. Once the solutions and result for a mock are out. First of all check up all the problems which you couldn’t solve. That’s what you have to learn.Then look at the time taken by the topper in solving a question. Look at your time. Did you take 200 seconds whereas the topper took 30 seconds? That’s because there is a technique you don’t about. Learn that technique. Write it in your notebook where you write formulas. That was about identifying and learning things which the toppers know. You have to be one of them. Go through the mocks and find such methods. AdditionallyThen there will be a category of questions you were sure of but you somehow used your talent and got it wrong and after looking at the solution you are like aree yaar yeh koi kaise galat kar sakta hai. But as a matter of fact, you did! This will happen mostly in counting problems (Numbers). Even if you had 100 in English in 10 and 12 you will still come to know that you had been using some Grammar rule incorrectly or there is some exception you had no clue about. But, after a -4 you will remember them! You will sometimes come to know that a certain word which you have been using all your life can also be used in a totally different context. Thank You without an exclamation mark? Sarcasm! Oxymoron, alliteration, etc. Learn what these mean. Such mistakes will make sure you remember all these. Sometimes you will take the diameter as the radius and solve. Sometimes 2*3 will become 5 and sometimes 7*19 will become 114. Don’t rush through problems. The paper is set so as to give you enough time. Slow and steady wins the race.Then another section in the results shows the % of people who attempted a question and % of people who got it right. You are supposed to attempt the easy ones first, then the average difficulty questions. Finally attempt a few difficult ones or totally leave them out. Here you can check which questions you were supposed to attempt but didn’t. Also the questions which you were supposed to leave but being the Bond that you are, you nonetheless decided to attempt it thereby losing marks and giving others a chance to overtake you. If your family is worth billions of dollars, you could do that, but given that you are still reading this, I doubt it! So whenever you look at such questions, try to think about what was in your mind during the mock which made you do such a thing. Try not to commit the same mistake again.Yes, I agree all this will take more than 3 hours. Who told you getting into a good B-school was easy?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?The study material from the top 3 institutes namely Time, CL and IMS is mostly the same. I have seen and used it, so use whichever you want, it won’t make a big difference. A few new ones like Hitbullseye and test funda are also coming up. Haven’t used the material by these 2 so can’t comment. In terms of content the level of questions is higher in Time. I mean tougher questions here, so you are better prepared for CAT, but then you could also argue about why put in more effort than required. In CL, the theory and explanations for quant is way better that that in others. Theory for quant is literally non-existent in Time. IMS is good for verbal. As mentioned above, please use that book for LR and also that book for Verbal. I have not mentioned the names of the books, because if you scroll up and check you will then remember the name when you have to tell it to the shopkeeper! That LR book will help make a strong base for you and then completing the LR material from these institutes will give you practise and improve your skills further. For those who keep talking about Arun Sharma, please please please use proper material. Do you really think 1 book is good enough for your CAT preparation and others are stupid who go through all that? If you think you are smart enough and don’t need all that and 1 book is enough. Good Luck with CAT!Mocks basically tell you where you stand when compared to the toppers in the country. Time has the most no of people attempting its Aimcats. So having that is a must. Next in line, with the maximum no of people attempting the mocks would be CL. After that you have IMS, test funda and all. Aimcats are pretty tough when compared to actual CAT but are extremely important because it gives you a true picture of where you stand and how much more effort you need to put in. CL mocks are close to the CAT level especially in terms of quant. IMS mocks are close to CAT level in verbal. I would suggest Time + CL/IMS. You can however take all the 3 if you want. Or maybe some other institute’s mock series. It’s mostly about practise.The mock questions are mostly the same. It’s just the values that they keep changing every year. Same with the material. Whether you look at the material of this year or that of 5 years ago, you will realise that it’s mostly the same. So, you are better off buying old material from someone or from a secondhand book store. I have uploaded some mocks and some prep material. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...https://drive.google.com/open?id...I also found some useful material from total gadha. Here’s the link for thathttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...I.) GD-PI-WAT prepFrankly speaking, getting a score is easy. This is the tougher part. This requires more hard work because in here, you will be up against the best in the country. Most of the people attending the interviews will come prepared, so here your odds will be higher. So, please work hard for this. GDPI prep as such should be dealt with in a different question. So, won’t go into the details here, but just an over view of what is expected of you. If you had done the GK and current affairs part as mentioned above, you will be easily able to manage the WAT. You will also have ample of points for speaking in a GD. Similarly questions on current affairs in a PI will also be a piece of cake for you. What remains is the HR part. In here, you have to understand that you can guide the interview and you can force them to ask exactly what you have prepared. But that requires a little thinking. Tell me about yourself is a standard question which is used to initiate an interview. It is mostly followed by your strengths and weaknesses. The main thing here is that you have to try to make a story and link everything that you have done in your life till now with why you want to do an MBA. The interviewers are smart people, they have been doing this for years. They are extremely good at catching liars. So think this through well. This part of your prep needs your utmost dedication and hard work. Prepare your answers properly. It is really tough to explain how to prepare for GD-PI. You will be better off at some institute where someone can guide you individually. However, what I can still do is upload all the GDPI material that I have and share it with you. But do keep one thing in mind, this contains some files on the current affairs of 2015, so that will be of no use for you. The other stuff is pretty much relevant. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...I hope you convert your dream college. May the force be with you!","How ‘NOT’ To prepare for CAT/GMATOne of the most important strategy in CAT/GMAT is to find out the wrong choices to identify the right one. This post is dedicated to “Avoiding Mistakes” strategy.Myth & Mistake-1: Following the Herd. Choosing a help or any coaching because others are choosing itHumans belongs to Animal kingdom. If you have studied Biology, then this point will be easier to understand. In animal kingdom. Weak animals are always in herd but the strong one is solitary or always having small groups. Ever wondered Why??The answer lies in the mentality. A strong animal judges the situation and leads its life based on its experience but a weak animal actions are based upon others. If others are doing it, then it’s wise to do it. You can choose to be a Herd follower or to make your own paths.Never follow the group. A leader never follows. If you will move with a group, you will always be with them. If you will create your paths, then only you can beat others. Adding following lines from Robert Frost to add a dramatic touch:“Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”Myth & Mistake-2: Focusing on absolute number of Successful Candidates rather than Percentage.Most of the Institutes talks about the number of success stories but are silent on how many of their students were unsuccessful. Even their Advertisements talks about total number of students getting Interview call or final admits. But the real numbers are shocking, most of the Institutes have 2-3 % students getting expected result.But the magic is in numbers. Make people follow a Herd and even if 2-3% students are successful, the success numbers become substantial. The problem is that your chances of landing in the unsuccessful students group is 98%, but this data does not bother them because they know how to work upon the “Herd Mentality” of the population. Show them 2% success stories and make them follow a herd.Myth & Mistake-3: The Bigger the Better.I am referring to Class Strength. No teacher can teach a herd. If your batch size is more than 10-12 students, then you are not getting proper attention from a teacher. If the education company is claiming “Customized or Personalized” services, then the class size must be less than 10-12 students.Myth & Mistake-4: Going after a Brand or No.1 education companyAll Branded books are easily available in the market at very low-cost. A student joins any help or coaching to get a personalized teaching experience. A Teacher-Student relation is analogous to a Mother-Child relation. There is nothing called “No. 1 Mother”. Every mother is No. 1 for her Kids and the reason is her personalized attention.Rather than sitting in a large group with “No. 1”, you should aim for a personalized attention (We join any help for their teachers or their course offering).Myth & Mistake-5: Deciding after taking DemosAll Institutes stage their Demos. They are very carefully planned. The teacher is usually the teacher, who will not teach regularly. If anyone says “Book your demo” or guide you to a specific time, then it is staged. The best way is to ask them about their class timings and insist on sitting in the ongoing class. If you feel the focus is on you, then you are at the wrong place.Try to identify honest institutes. Honesty should be a very important deciding factor.Myth & Mistake-6: Choosing Institute which makes “Toppers” or just focuses on “Past Records”Never choose any institute if its marketing is focused on this fundamental. Keep your basics simple. Think what you want from it and focus on its delivery. You are there for education, not to hear its past stories.Institutes focus on this factor to take your attention away from their product. Your focus should only be on their product, their teachers, their teaching methodologies, their course structures, etc.Myth & Mistake-7: Jo Dikhta hai, Wo (Nahi) Bikta haiA good product needs no marketing. Weak products need marketing. Whenever you see lots of marketing effort, Google ads, ATL or BTL, it proves that the product is weak. Strong product does not need for all these advertisements. In the marketing world, out of 4Ps, the product is supreme. Focus on “Product”.Myth & Mistake-8: Marketing Gimmick-CAT/GMAT Toppers as TeachersThis is the most commonly used marketing tool, which has a flawed assumption. Now I am talking more of “Critical Reasoning” language. The flawed assumption is “All Toppers are good Teachers”. Teaching needs a very different skill set. The teaching is to impart knowledge; all toppers cannot be good teachers and all good teachers cannot be toppers.Myth & Mistake-9: Institutes offering Patented Techniques or “Tips & Tricks”All tests require “Hard Work”. If someone can patent “Hard-work”, then this “Gimmick” should be accepted. “Tips & Tricks” are developed with your hard-work. Shortcuts should be evolved and should never be learnt from someone else. Particularly for CAT/GMAT, which is more of an IQ test, “Techniques, Tips & Tricks” should be evolved.Myth & Mistake-10: CAT/GMAT will take me to HarvardThis point is more applicable to business schools taking GMAT as a screening tool.The student’s full profile will work. The CAT/GMAT is a one small part of the profile. Look at all business schools as a family, no family will allow you to be their part till the time they see their values or virtues in you. Every Business school has a distinct positioning and your profile should be positioned in the same way. Profile building is the main work and every person should concentrate on.Myth & Mistake-11: Adopting Toppers StrategiesHear everyone, but adopt none. Every person develops his own ways depending upon his Strengths & Weaknesses or as per his conditions. Good for someone may not be good for you. Hear everyone, but adopt only wisely.Myth & Mistake-12: Practice-More the merrierPractice Better, Not More. The practice should have a direction, running in circles will not help. Do Tests and review. Keep error Logs and keep on practicing. Practice wisely, so that every time you move, you should learn from your past mistakes. Do not overdo the tests.Myth & Mistake-13: Teachers will make me a TopperTeachers show us directions. Unless you practice the topics taught in the class, it will not work. I saw many students thinking that if they spend more time in classes, it will help.Myth & Mistake-14: All tests just needs lot of studying, no need to focus on healthHealthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. I see many students not focusing on their health during exams. Many of the studious people have unhealthy bodies. You need to balance life with at least 7-8 hours’ sleep.Myth & Mistake-15: I do not need any peer groupYou learn more from peers than the teachers. The most important factor will be jealousy. Competition in the group brings the best out of you. I was very fortunate that all others in my group were good. They have already scored more than 700 in prep tests. Every test was like a world war where every one of us wanted to beat everyone else in the group.Myth & Mistake-16: I will study and practice from lot of free materials on netBeware of free materials. There is no free lunch. Some free materials are good, but most of it is crap. The real test is different from the Free tests you see on the net. You will be caught off-guard if you are preparing from the net material.Myth & Mistake-17: Beware from 30-day toppers, 15-day toppersThis is the most common way of advertisement. Become a topper in 30 days or 15 days. It’s hilarious. This is a perfect example of fraud marketing. The CAT/GMAT is an IQ test. Only Asterix magic potion can do it and nothing else.Myth & Mistake-18: You can deceive GMAT Computer Adaptive AlgorithmPlease do not try. GMAC has evolved a test which cannot be deceived. Every question can carry you “Up” and throw you “Down”. Each question is important and has the same value as others do.One more myth is when a student believes that difficult questions carry more marks. And easy questions weightage is low. Do not read too much into any strategy. Work hard and it will show.One more mistake is trying to gauge your performance by counting correct questions out of total. This is the reason why the GMAC computer algorithm is difficult to copy.If you see easy questions, you are not doomed. It does not necessarily mean that your test is not going well.Myth & Mistake-19: Quantitative is important, Engineers have an advantageEngineers do not have any advantage in this test. Rather, they are at a disadvantage because their strength (Quant.) does not have substantial weightage. I have seen many students crossing 700 with 40 in quant and Q40 can be achieved by more than 80% of the test givers.Myth & Mistake-20: I am good in English, verbal will be kids playVerbal is not English, verbal is all about IQ. The only portion of the grammar it touches is SC. But the way CAT/GMAT tests your grammar is more based on IQ rather than grammar rules. SC is more about identifying the wrong choices rather than the correct one. It depends upon how easily you can see 2-3 splits and apply logic to find the correct answer.In CAT/GMAT, there is no perfect answer, you must mark the “Most” correct answer. There might not be any perfect answer in the five choices.Your choices should be based on your experience and how a help will help you cover your shortcomings. I found EduShastra customized approach much better than others. I also found their teachers dedicated to their students.","I'll tell you step by step how you should study to get 99.9 percentile in CAT,now you have around say 11 months to prepare. so CAT exam typically comprises of1.

CAT Exam,How should I start my preparations for the CAT 2019 if I am weak in maths?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-start-my-preparations-for-the-CAT-2019-if-I-am-weak-in-maths,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",8,"As a rule, there is no distinction in the procedure and on the center territory between such competitors and others. There is a high number of such understudies each year who figure out how to split the CAT, notwithstanding not being from a designing/measurements/maths/scientific science foundation. In 2017, three non-building understudies got 100 percentile score in CAT. From here, it is very obvious that on the off chance that you plan hard, you additionally have a reasonable opportunity to get 99 or more percentile score in CAT.One should draw a limit among QA and maths. CAT requests just fundamental numerical aptitudes that we have learnt till class 10. CAT does not center around hypothetical thoughts but rather the use of essential ideas. This basically implies your insight into essential number-crunching and proportionality apparatuses, numbers, time speed remove, basic combinatorics, variable based math and geometry is all that could possibly be needed to enable you to split the test. The greater part of the issues present a dimension ground for everybody so there isn't a lot of leverage that engineers or other 'maths individuals' have. Most understudies escape and spotlight on 'exciting' ideas while dismissing more straightforward ones.Fundamental scientific expertise is only one component of the QA segment and alternate measurements are more vital. These are the capacity to perform in a weight circumstance, perception expertise, basic leadership, versatility/adaptability lastly a capacity to understand the inquiries.Tackling a CAT quant issue is a stepwise procedure and the fundamental calculation isStep-I: Comprehension of an inquiry,Step-II: Interpretation, that is, what is given and what is required et al.Step-III: Problem-unraveling (whenever required).Prior to moving to step-III, one ought to investigate every one of the conceivable outcomes of answer alternative disposal through different methodologies like perception or through discovering the scope of guesstimate esteems in the wake of dissecting the extraordinary cases. To teach the above arrangement of aptitudes, one needs to rehearse well. Time-bound practice will assist the understudies with understanding what ideas they require to return to.

CAT demands only basic mathematical skills that we have learnt till class 10. CAT does not focus on theoretical ideas but the application of basic concepts.This essentially means that your knowledge of basic arithmetic and proportionality tools, numbers, time speed distance, elementary combinatorics, algebra and geometry is more than enough to help you crack the test.Most of the problems present a level ground for everyone so there isn’t much of an advantage that engineers or other ‘maths people’ have. Most students get carried away and focus on ‘glamorous’ concepts while neglecting simpler ones.Basic mathematical skill is just one dimension of the QA section and the other dimensions are more important. These are the ability to perform in a pressure situation, observation skill, decision making, adaptability/flexibility and finally an ability to comprehend the questions.Solving a CAT Quant problem is a step wise process and the basic algorithm isStep-I: Comprehension of a question,Step-II: Interpretation, that is, what is given and what is required.Step-III: Problem-solving (if required).Before moving to step-III, one should explore all the possibilities of answer option elimination through various approaches like observation or through finding out the range of guesstimate values after analyzing the extreme cases. To inculcate the above set of skills, one needs to practice well.Time-bound practice will help the students to understand what concepts they require to revisit. Prepare a compendium of formulas topic-wise in a logical order. You need to also understand the restrictions, conditions, under which these are valid.Preparation tips :1. Learn the theory from first principles :Make a conscious effort to learn theory from basic ideas. We have a tendency to 'jump' steps when we get familiar with a topic. Resist the temptation to use plug-and-play formulae and learn the theory with an open mind.2. Do 'the grind' :Do lots of practice. Intuition is important, but the ability to power through lots of questions is extremely vital. Major portions of the processes should be on 'autopilot'. Fatigue is an important factor in CAT and it is nearly impossible to be switched on for 140 minutes continuously. When confronted with a tricky question, if you pick the right approach after may be 60 seconds of thinking, the remaining 100 seconds of actually solving the question should be done in mechanical fashion; in a manner that does not take much out of you.More the processes on autopilot, the less tired you get, and therefore better the odds of 'cracking' the key idea behind the next question. To give a parallel, think about the time you tried to learn to drive a car (or ride a bike). In the first few instances, when the gear-clutch-brake mechanisms were still new, the experience would have been very tiring. Driving for even 30 minutes would have been exhausting. When the mind is processing that level of data, fatigue creeps in rapidly. But once you have done 200 kms on a vehicle, muscle-memory kicks in, the left hand and left leg move automatically, without having to be 'told'. Now, there is even bandwidth to speak on the phone while driving! Hands Free Please!3. Handle tougher questions by revisiting theory:Once you have learnt from first principles and done the grind, you would have learnt all standard templates. Now the knowledge base is set, it is time build the ability to 'discover' newer frameworks. Ask more fundamental questions and work with proofs and properties.","Hi Shubham GuptaYou have ample amount of time and hence my advise would be to start from the very basic level.Use R.S.Aggarwal books for learning basic formulas and solving easy aptitude questions. After finishing this book, refer “Handa Ka Funda” online course to smoothly sail through this CAT preparation journey. This course will help you rewind to any topic anytime which in turn will be a great boon for you to recollect any concept whenever needed. It also teaches each and every topic right from the primary level which is a great boon for beginners and non-math students.Focus on your English and fundamental aptitude skills. The following are the primary actions you will have to take and work on religiously:Polish primary Grammar rules (Refer “High School Grammar by Wren and Martin” for practice)The Articles – A, An, TheParts of SpeechSentence ConstructionModifiersSubject-Verb AgreementVerbs TensesMake reading newspaper and novels part of your daily routine.Spend 40 mins for reading articles and editorials from newspapers like ‘The Hindu’, Economic Times, Mint, etc.Read a novel for an hour, refer to -Recommended Books and Novels List that every MBA / CAT Aspirant Should Read. While reading, make notes of important/difficult words with its meaning, synonyms antonyms. This will further build vocabulary extensively useful in solving RCs.Use the books by Nishit Sinha and CL for practice.Spend 2 hours daily and by the end of June you should have completed the learning and practice part sincerely.Later start taking sectional mocks by TIME. Identify the weaker areas and practice rigorously. After you feel content, switch to taking full-length mocks. After taking a mock, scrutinize it carefully to find the reasons behind your mistakes. This method is largely useful in preparing yourself for the best.Tips:At the beginning of preparation, solve 2 RC passages every day without fail.After completing the whole syllabus of CAT start solving 5 DI questions and 3–4 RC passages every day. Keep taking sectional mocks daily until you attain the confidence with respect to each section.Spend at least 2 hours for preparation even if you are occupied for the day.Make notes along with practicing questions daily. Any sort of idea or new shortcut should be part of these notes.A quick revision in the early morning of the previous day preparation. This works wonders!Make use of each and every day with sincerity and devotion, success will be definitely yours.Hope this helps you. All the best!"
CAT Exam,Is cetking a good institute for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//Is-cetking-a-good-institute-for-CAT,"CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching",10,"I got AIR 1 in CMAT ( Score 350/400) and I have seen lot of bootlickers after that.What I am writing is on the basis of my own experience with two cheats from cetking — rav singh and ketan kg.CETKING is Full of cheats. I tell you my experience with them. I have never been student of that institute but they are so shameless that used my name to make others fool. They need only one thing — money by displaying fake result.Kindly read below how I exposed CETKING'S fraud.******** Exposed Cetking*******I could have opted to remain silent and it would have made me rich too, but my values don't allow me to do this.I want to bring out the truth in front of you so that you don’t waste your parent’s hard earned money and your precious time… and may be your entire life…I know the consequences too that might happen to me after I post this and you guys will be able to figure out who will be behind all this.What I am going to talk about, needs a lot of courage. This post will shock you, as it shocked me when I heard that Rav Singh CETKING is using my name to misguide students.I got AIR 1 in CMAT 2017 and was fortunate enough to get into JBIMS, Mumbai. Before joining this prestigious institute, I DIDN'T TAKE ANY COACHING to prepare for my mba entrance examinations. All I did was burning the mid night oil. Those sleepless nights and I believe that the god has been kind to me to get AIR 1 in my first attempt.After CMAT result I came to know Rav Singh.He invited me to his 1 day workshop in pune. I went there for a day. Just for a day.(And I HAD HAD NO HELP FROM THAT ONE DAY WORKSHOP) and Now Rav Singh says that he will get the affidavit from court and prove I am his student. what All I have to say is that if you go there for 1 day then another person uses your name to run his business not because of the reason he helped me but because of the reason he couldn't give that result what he supposed to give. What an achiever !!And it didn't happen for the first time. I have visited say no to cetking facebook page which says it has happened earlier as well.On the very first day I met RAV Singh, I told him that I was not “Saleable”. When I came to know that he had been misguiding students saying that I was his student, I thought to share this with all the aspirants.I took NO HELP FROM HIM IN ANY WAY TO PREPARE for CMAT, I haven't even heard about it before.It is just a beginning of story. When I retrospect I realize what all had happened behind me. He is using my photo and writing name as Suhas instead of Saras so that anyone could not claim it that Saras didn’t take coaching. Moreover we were in touch through whatsapp but he blocked me from his facebook group name – target jbims dream team, so that I couldn't come to know how was he using my name.Yesterday when I talked to him about all of it he told he had no idea that he used my name and it was a printing mistake. A big liar. I found it in one of his posters too where my name and photo was there… Wow! Great..Another person Ketan from cetking kept on texting me on whatsapp to share my scorecard so that he could make students fool that I was CETKING students.Folks, there is big game going on by cetking to trap you in. If you join them once they think you are under them.He has blocked me from everywhere after this post and a lot of manipulation will be made to prove they were right.They are many and I am alone. Why am I exposing him- I don't want any one to spoil his career in false hopes.I have all the screenshots which I would have posted but those coward people blocked me from everywherr.Cowards block people.When I exposed him on social media He also made a fake receipt on which my name is there to misguide you all again. The coaching which begs outsiders to use their name to ruin career of students, can not be the one to select.It is all upto you guys. All is in front of you and you are brave and wise enough to take the decision what to choose and what not. I wish you all the best for the upcoming exams you are going to take. May your result make your parents feel proud of you. Stay healthy, stay happy and most importantly be yourself.In my opinion IF YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF THE COACHING WHICH STANDS ON FAKE AND PURCHASED RESULT, you can join cetking. You are in a better position to see what happens to your career then.","No. They are much into NMAT rather than CAT. Also the real thing is they have a facebook group by Rav or Raghav guy who shares question in the facebook as per their window. In this way they create a good result for NMAT which is truly unethical. Neither NMAT cares for such activities. They even changed their testing company but still the practice remains the same. Unfortunately Narsee Monjee is yet again creating another scam which they did few years back. It's true they will again say they have no hand in this. Now imagine if a teacher gives impetus to such activity, how great he is into his teaching practices. I am just being truthful here. Regards,Online Preparation Platform","I had 2 classes, both from Mr.Ketan, the one and only. First class, he talked for some 10 minutes about himself, his attitude towards the approach to exam, how we should think like him etc. He went for a phone call after 10 minutes. And the moment he went out, i was like wtf? True, he was in IIM trinity, he got amazing marks in verbal. But he is no tutor. The best thing he taught us is to never sit in his class.Anyway, i decided i’ll give him a shot, go with the flow and see if i should withdraw or not. The guy keeps saying f*ck, shit like that always as if he is teaching in a low standard local college. Anyway, i bypassed that too. I went with it. But there is a limit. The guy keeps slobbering about how he is the best in teaching what he teaches blah blah blah. My patience was starting to run out. He never stopped his show off attitude like ever. I have never seen a stupider class before. I kept thinking about what to do after the class ends-which coaching institute should i shift to? til the class ended. Right after the class ended i asked 2 completely stranger class mates what they felt. They said they are going to apply to some other institution on the way. I also thought I would do the same. Then i thought-this was the first class,maybe he was trying to break the ice. I’ll give one more shot. I did and i regretted in the first 5 minutes of his class. His classes ruined our mood so bad most of us lost mood in the other classes. I withdrew that day itself and told the admission office that his classes suck. They didn’t even flinch. Like they are used to this.Anyway the last part is the refund. They made me call several people on their management to get it back. When i said the reason, they were like “its your problem you can’t follow his class, you shouldn’t blame him”. Fine, its my fault, just give my money back. One week passed, no response. I went there again, called the management in front of them, still no response. I gave the 2 people at admissions a fair warning that i would take this up a notch. They were like “yeah sure go for it”.They will drag you and make you kiss their boots to get your own money back. I’m not sure if this is for entire management, but i would suggest everyone to join CETking if you have too much money with you and you want some of it to go away for nothing.P.S- I used to watch the YouTube videos by Rav sir and i never had a bad opinion about it.","Absolutely not! In fact, if you are in middle of listing down your options to consider, erase them out completely.You’ll know why in reading the experience down below. Of course, this is my experience and I am providing my viewpoint on basis of their content, authenticity and my perspective as a student.My list of options to consider in Mumbai Suburbs was:TIME - but the reviews had gone terribly bad for them in terms of teaching and holding classes. Plus, there was no communication with the centre head in terms of explaining their process. Since their staff wasn’t interested I just could not see how well it would even be with them later.IMS - Well, their batch was full and no batch was to begin within next 1.5 months.CET King - I happen to see their advertisement and went in to inquire. I met with a centre co-ordinator who conveyed himself as an ex-student there. He painted this rosy picture and their sample lecture was just nice. I decided to take the admission and went ahead on the part. Communication with him until then was prompt, nice and elaborate on all the questions and his personal experience.But everything changed right after the admission. The classes did not start on the mentioned date and I was regularly following up on when they will. Along with that, the first lecture was suppose to be my Mr. Rao, who happens to be head of the institute, which never happened when the classes began a week later.That day, the lecture time being 7.30am, I could see no soul - either from CETKing staff or any other student. All calls to the area head were in vain so I decided to call the admin I was in communication with and as I was doing, he suggested I wait. As conclusion, I waited and later in time the classes were cancelled.This again happened during the next scheduled lecture, where the professor did show up, late in time but the keys to the classroom were locked up in office which the prof. had no access to.Again, when the first lecture did happen, way ahead in days, the verbal ability lecture was conducted by a professor newly instated by CETKing and whose efficiency weren’t very proficient in English language. He suggested us to use notes of IMS, since they were much better that this classes.It was their policy that students could withdraw within 3 attending 3 classes. But by the first class itself, I was terribly upset and decided to withdraw my admission.I still feel so angry while narrating what happen afters. CETKing officials had no idea about the refund process and decided to speak me into staying put with them. After a BIG and FIRM “NO” they put me in touch with this official from Thane branch and I mention her because she has given me a hardtime like no other.During my whole discussion of refund, there was no communication from their end, “let me keep calling and once in a while CETKing will grace me with an answer” was their response. I thought taking up the communication with Institute’s head would be more professional but rather he turned out to be spineless and without any answer.Moral of the whole 2 months of refund communication being that they deducted Rs. 10k on pretext of generating login for online course (which I never received until very late in the refund process, when I asked them to submit an email or a letterhead message stating that they have deducted the said amount for enrolling into online course they never gave me that. This only reaffirmed by doubt of them conning me. But, I was drained in efforts and had to focus back to preparing for CET and CAT if I had to stay on the course and could not pursue the lethargic process of Consumer Redressal.I share this with you as a lesson learnt out of this loss. I had a bad way out, I hope you don’t. This can be tragic to the focus on preparing for a challenging exam and thus, please make a wise decision before moving ahead.As a tip from this lesson,a. Hold on to the admission fee until the first class, atleast.b. Ask recently passed out students about their experiences with some classes in your area. This is the best review available.c. Ask questions to the officials at class and the teachers.And,All the best!"
CAT Exam,How should I start my preparation for CAT-2019?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-start-my-preparation-for-CAT-2019,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",69,"Hello Folks!Thanks for A2AAs you have more than one year for CAT-19 preparation, you should make sure that you make a very strong platform to nail the exam! It is in mastering basics that the key to CAT prep lies.So, how to prepare?Before starting your preparation, go through the syllabus and exam pattern once. The syllabus is divided into three sections-Verbal Ability and reading comprehensionData Interpretation and Logical ReasoningQuantitative AbilityRevising your basics well is the most important part of your preparation. Only after you clear your concepts, you can do well in CAT. Complete the basics(chapter wise). Most CAT chapters are from your high school syllabus(class 8–9–10). Revise them all properly. Additionally, do lots of CAT relevant reading; daily newspaper(The Hindu, Economic Times, NYT etc.), magazines or any random articles on philosophy and psychology from wikipedia. You can also read non fiction novels and follow management blogs to nourish your reading habit. This will help you a lot in building higher speed and comprehension for CAT. You should also build good puzzle habits! Solve crossword and sudoku from a good English daily on a regular basis. This will sharpen your mind for CAT.Your motive should be to revise the concepts and to overcome the fear of certain topics if you had them during your school days. Some students never liked Geometry in school; some were never good in reading; some had issues with permutation combination - These issues need to be tackled first. Get over your fears in the first 4–5 months of your CAT 2019 preparation. This is the key to gaining confidence and also to perfect competition. A good CAT learning module with CAT experts can help here.Post covering your basics, your focus should shift on learning the best methods to solving CAT level questions. At my coaching (Bfactory), we focus on these major aspects:1. Value putting2. Option elimination3. Speed reading4.Structuring of information5.Shortcut methodsYou should try to think faster and sharper than before.6–7 months before CAT, start giving topic and sectional tests and solve advance level questions as many as you can. Be disciplined in your efforts and you will feel the change in your aptitude levels by this time!Give your last few months in giving full mocks and do complete analysis of your mocks. Analysis of mocks will help you point out your weaker sections and the areas where you do silly mistakes. Once you know your weak areas your task is to work upon them to convert them into your strong areas. Practice more questions until you excel in those topics. Testing makes perfect in a competition.CAT preparation is like a Marathon; start well and keep moving! Make sure you finish well!Kamlesh Sir(IIM Ahmedabad) and I are in Delhi for a CAT meet up(informal career chat over coffee at CCD, Connaught Place) on 14th July. If you want to meet up and discuss CAT prep, click on this link:Invitations, Free eCards and Party Planning Ideas from EviteHappy learning!Rahul SirCAT Coachwww.bfactory.in","The main and the biggest obstacle a student faces is “Procrastination”. The excuse of starting CAT Preparation from tomorrow will only lead a candidate to a position where he/she will search the net on “how to crack CAT in 1 month or a week ?“ Before reaching this point the candidate should get up and start their preparation and don’t delay your preparation even by a day. One of the most important things is not to do the countdown in months but do the countdown in days.From where to start the preparation?BasicsCandidates should start off by revising their basics. The strength of the building depends on its foundation. Similarly, a candidate through with their basics would face less difficulty than the candidates who are not sure about basics of each section in CAT.MocksCandidates should give a mock or two to understand where they stand and what are their weak or strong areas in the CAT Exam. This will help the candidate to understand their level of preparation at the present moment and understand the sections that the candidate should concentrate more on.Past Papers20% of the CAT Paper is repeated every year. Candidate should give major attention to this data. Since real CAT Papers are not present online candidates can download the CAT Past Papers that are similar to the CAT Previous year Papers. This will not only help because 20% paper is repeated but the candidate will get an idea of what will the rest 80% of the paper consist.Things that the candidate should avoid doing during their CAT Preparation.All kinds of Study Material-Refer to a particular study material. Candidates often buy all the study material available in the market which leads to panic and demotivates them to a great extent. So stick to one set of study material and complete it thoroughly then if needed shift to a different set of study materialOnly Collecting Information-Most of the candidates search on the net for various tips and strategies to Crack CAT. But piling up the information from various platforms and zero application would be of no use. Candidates can spend one particular day and search all the strategies and shortcuts on the internet but after that stop searching and start applying it in the mocks and understand whether they are helpful or not.Panic Mode-Don’t freak out and press the panic button just because the preparation days are getting lesser day by day. Every person is different and has different strength and weakness. The preparation level of every candidate is different so follow your own plan and stick to it.Influence and EnvironmentHowever simple or stupid this sounds a candidate’s surroundings, environment and their company play a major role in their level of preparation. Surround yourself with people who are willing to fight and have a positive attitude. This will boost your energy and motivational level which will also push the candidate to put their 110% in the CAT Preparation.Things that the Candidate should consider during their CAT Preparation-Analyse Mocks-Candidate should not give the mock test and analyze the mock on the same day. Take one full day to analyze the mock given and understand the weak and the strong areas.Strategies and ShortcutsCandidates should try different types of shortcuts and strategies in the practice mocks and decide one strategy to be used in the CAT Preparation. Trying out a new strategy on the day of the exam is a strict no the tried and tested strategy which is in favor of the candidate should be executed in the exam.Number of MocksThe number of mocks in total given by the student should be at least 40-50 Analysed Mocks. Initially, a candidate should start with giving one mock in a week and after a month when he/she is clear with their basics and know their level of preparation start off with giving 2-3 mocks in a week.","CAT is not only about giving entrance exam, you need 2 years to prepare yourself for MBA. Entrance test is the easiest part among the steps involved in MBA.Things you should start doing-1- Start reading Newspaper daily ( atleast 2 and read opinion and business page)2- Start building your resume (Do certifications, join NGO, Write research papers and articles)3- Start working on your Hobby and answer to “tell me about yourself”4- Identify your weak areas and forte.5- Then devise a strategy to improve your weak areas and refine your areas of excellenceYou can also join my FB page CAT / XAT / IIFT - MBA Prep, Log into Facebook | Facebook for concept notes, questions and strategies.You can ask any doubt that you have and it will be answered.","CAT is generally conducted on last Sunday of November. So it is safe to say there are 50 weeks for CAT-2019. The time is sufficient for anyone to prepare for CAT and get excellent score, provided he/she is dedicated and ready to work hard. People with good basics would be having an obvious advantage. Those who are not good with basics can bridge the gap given the time for CAT-2019.Let’s discuss how should one approach for CAT-2019. We can briefly divide preparation in 2 parts- one is actual CAT exam and profile.1.Profile-Your profile consists of your curricular and extra-curricular achievements, your hobbies, interests and expertise if any. Your 10th/12th/grad score are important. If you have a good score there it gives you an edge. In case if they are not too great, there are many thing that can be done for building your profile. You can’t go back to change those scores so don’t waste your time worrying about it. Do various certifications(related to your field of interest can be preferred), social work, have a hobby/field of interest. It can be anything so find what you are interested in. Work Experience is also important part of your profile.2. Actual CAT-From past 3 years the pattern of CAT is almost same. So it is safe to assume that there won’t be any major changes next year too. But keep yourself prepared for various situations. We can say there will be 3 sections again.1.VARC(34 questions)- VARC or English section is generally said to be easy or moderate section. But it is important that you score as many marks as you can in this section.RC- Out of those 34 questions 24 questions are asked on RCs. There are 5 passages in total having length of roughly around 650–700 words. Trust me, you won’t need reading speed of 220/250 wpm, If you read the passage in 5 mins and answer questions in next 5–6 mins, that is sufficient. For that start reading. Read good news papers then move on to better ones. Read not only novels but also autobiographies and books about technical things. Try to make yourself comfortable with as many topics as you can because we never know RC related to which topic might appear in the CAT.VA- For VA Parajumbles, out-of-context, summary are hot topics. Prepare for those topics. When you are reading try to focus on how the sentences are connected to each other. Write the summary of the articles you read. It will definitely help you. Also build vocabulary. Even if there aren’t any direct questions in CAT, it will help you in understanding passages. They generally use few tricky words. Also prepare grammar/sentence correction and critical reasoning. In case these questions are asked you must be familiar with those topics.2.DILR-(32 questions)- Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning is notorious for its difficulty level. Solving 16 questions correctly gives you 99 percentile in most of the cases. But there are 5–6 doable sets in this section. All you need is proper set selection and ability to face the pressure of the exam. There is always a set on Venn Diagram(generally higher difficulty). Practice all the direct topics but we can’t expect direct sets in this section. So as soon as you are done with it try solving sets from previous CATs, Solve 3–4 sets daily. That is sufficient for his section.3.Quant-(34 questions)- It is the only section that has predefined syllabus. It is dependent on high-school mathematics. Start working on those concepts. Make yourself comfortable in the topics of higher importance. Nothing can be said about difficulty level of the paper so be prepared. Try to make your own shortcuts and use the methods which you find easy. Try to list all the formulas and don’t just keep them on tip of your tongue. Also learn how to apply them. Try to find out shortest methods for the problems you solve. It would save your time.Few general tips- Join 1–2 good test series. You’ll find 2017/2018 CAT papers online. Solve them after you are prepared well. Try to find strategies which work for you. CAT is not difficult to crack if you are prepared well.All the Best!!Cheers!!"
CAT Exam,What is a very rare motivational story that you know that I don't?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-a-very-rare-motivational-story-that-you-know-that-I-dont,"Motivational Stories, Common Admission Test (CAT)",23,"“I made up my mind as a young guy, I want to become world class at something. I just had to find out what that something is going to be”. Well, when Christopher Paul Gardner found out that “something”, he went on to become a millionaire and the CEO of his own stockbrokerage firm, Gardner Rich and Co. from nearly nothing.Although not rare, Gardner’s motivational story has touched the life of millions and inspired so many young professionals and entrepreneurs.The person who cut grass, rubbed floors, cleaned trash, did roofing and painted walls strived to earn a repute and become a successful trader in the Wall Street.Gardner had also promised to himself that he would never let his child go through that same pain and suffering that he endured when he was a fatherless child. Gardner had a troubled childhood where he and his mother alongwith his sisters were physically abused by his stepfather. The wounds inflicted by those abuse and domestic violence stayed with Gardner forever. But he became a successful and caring parent by keeping the promise of loving and nurturing his child even during his bad days.Speaking of his bad days, Chris Gardner was homeless for a year. To make matter worse, his son Chris Jr. was left with him by his estranged wife who had some months back moved to some other US city with their child because she was unhappy with Gardner’s unemployment (“Unemployment brings trouble in married life”)Gardner left his job as a medical equipment salesman to get into a full time training program at E.F Hutton. But Gardner was running on bad luck those days, as the hiring manager, who had promised a seat to him, was just fired a week before from the firm. This practically rendered Gardner jobless!It was during this time, Gardner took to cutting grass, moping floors or painting walls to earn a livelihood and support his family that was falling apart. For every dollar he earned, he had to make a wise decision to spend that dollar. From running daily errands to keep food on the table, to paying house rent and buy this and that, he did all that he could to keep his family bonded with the meagre income he made.Gardner had met a man on a red ferrari someday while he was still working as a medical equipment salesman. This man confided him that he was a stockbroker and roughly earned $80,000 a month. It was from here Gardner’s thirst for stockbrokerage had developed. This man later introduced Gardner to many managers of stock brokerage firms. The fired manager from E.F Hutton was one of them.While he was still cleaning floors, roofing and cutting grass, he took appointments with these managers and tried to convince them in every meeting to grant him a seat in their training programs.His continuous efforts had paid off when he was considered for a training program at Dean Witter Reynolds’ stock brokerage firm. But his stars were so playing against him, that he got jailed for 10 days for accumulating parking tickets worth $1200 in a high security prison for criminals. With a phone call from prison, he had managed to convince some big guy at Dean Witters that he would be joining two days later as he got entangled with some urgent work.As the training program at DWR didn’t offered any salary, he was depleted of livelihood. He lost his abode. His wife had left him with his son, only to return after 4 months to keep his son with him. Homeless, devastated with lack of financial resources, and with the burden of responsibility of his child, Gardner and his son ate whatever they could, wherever they could. They ate in soup kitchens and charity halls. They took shelter in church, slept in parks and flophouses(generally the size of office cubicle rooms), hid under his desk after office and also shut themselves in railway bathroom. With whatever money he saved(he sold his medical equipments), he paid for his son’s daycare.Gardner, after all this, passed the training with flying colours and also got a job at Bear Stearns and Company in San Francisco. A turning point in his life.He had made it through!The coming years saw Gardner rose to great heights . He bought his own house and own Ferrari. His career rapidly ascending into the stratosphere, in 1987 he opened his own investment firm, Gardner Rich.Today Mr Gardner, 64, is worth an estimated $60m (£48m), travels the world as a motivational speaker, and sponsors a number of homeless charities and organisations that combat violence against women.Will Smith played Chris Gardner in Gardner’s biopic “The pursuit of happyness”Mr. Gardner you are a living legend and your journey is a motivation. Its an honour to write an article on you!What lesson his journey teaches:-Success comes to those who dare and act.Happiness is not cheap and affordable. One has to pursue happiness.Thanks for reading","Well, there are millions of motivational stories in the world. Many out there on the internet, but a person can only come across so many in a lifetime.My personal favorite is of two people, Elon Musk and Alan Turing. I’d like to tell the former. For Alan Turing, you can watch the movie “The Imitation Game”, or maybe i’ll come back to this question someday and write the bits of his life not widely known.What would you do if you are in your early 30s and have over $150 million in your bank account? I don’t know about you, but i’d probably buy an island, couple of big mansions, never work again, might do some investments but probably spend the rest of my life resting and travelling.Elon was different. For him, money was nothing more than a source of creating a better future for humanity. We all know what SpaceX has achieved but not a lot of people know why it was started in the first place.Elon was always fascinated by the space exploration and the idea of making life multi planetary. Back in 2002, after the paypal was sold to ebay for $1.5 billion, Elon being the biggest share holder, ended up with $165 million in addition to $22 million from his first venture, Zip2 . He went to the website of NASA, looking for future plans that NASA has for Mars. Turns out there were none.He thought there isn’t enough will left in people for space exploration anymore. He decided to do something to get people excited about the space, which might even result in increase in NASA budget. So, he decided to send a greenhouse to Mars, hydrate it upon landing. So, it would be like “this is the farthest life has ever traveled.” He thought it would get people excited for space again. He didn’t have his own rockets at that time, so he had no choice but to buy them. American rockets were too expensive to afford, so he went to Russia three times to buy Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). He even closed a deal of three rockets for $10 million each.Later, he realized, it’s not that there isn’t enough will, the reason we stopped was because it was too expensive to go to space. And the only way to solve this issue is by starting his own space company. He knew the odds of success of SpaceX was less than 10% cause going to orbit is a tricky thing and hence not many countries are capable of sending people or satellite to orbit. He only had enough money to create and launch three rockets. And guess what, SpaceX had three failures in a row. It was 2008, tesla, SpaceX and Solar City, all three companies of Elon was at the edge of failure. It was the year of financial crisis, it was impossible to find investor, especially for a company that had 3 rocket failures in a row. Tesla was also trying to raise the financing round but it fell apart cause people didn’t have money.Elon only had two choices, either to invest whatever he has left into SpaceX and Tesla and save them for a little bit or let them die. He poured all of his money into them. If there was another rocket failure, the SpaceX would’ve died. As for Tesla, they closed the financing deal with Daimler on last hour of last day possible (Eve of 25th December, 2008). Tesla would’ve gone bankrupt a couple days later if it weren’t for that deal.It’s not his companies that excites me, it’s his determination, his will to improve. No one thought that resusability of rockets is even feasible. But while others were busy giving reasons why it can’t be done, Elon was busy finding ways of how possibly it can be done. That’s what i find inspiring about him. We find excuses, while he finds ways. He works over 80 hours a week. Being CEO of two big companies is not easy. Any day he could wake up and decide “i don’t want to deal with this stress. I will hire a CEO to run this for me.” He doesn’t have to work 80 hours but he does. At SpaceX and Tesla, he doesn’t even have his own office. He has a cubicle, just like others. There are million more things about his life that i could list, but it’s already too long for an answer. Here are links to two interviews of him that you should definitely watch. If his life doesn’t inspire you, i don’t know what will.","This is a Real Story: Facebook3 year ago, Zuckerberg got disappointed at the current justice system. so he decided to do something to change it for the better, his research lead him to the San Quentin program, This program aimed at educating prisoners so they have shot at a better life when they get out.Zuckerberg did not waste a moment to become a part of it so, he supported and funded that program. He even visited the San Quentin prison to see the differences it hade made.To his surprise, It was success with many of the prisoners and one of them named “Aly Tamboura” stood out from the rest. He was sentenced 14 years in prison and he thought that all hope was lost for future but feeling of Motivation arose in him when Mark Zuckerberg came on a tour of the prison.Zukerberg personally met and told Tamboura how impressed he was by his efforts.and even encouraged him to apply at facebook. that feeling of approval from Zuckerberg stayed with him long after.He worked day and night to learn how to code and become as good at it, as possibly could.When aly got released, he got a job at Facebook. he even met Mark after joining the facebook.To Tamboura’s shock, Mark remembered him and congratulated him on making it this far.Today, Tamboura is Manager of Technology for Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.“Second chances are given to prove that we could be better even after we fall.”Everyone deserves a second chance to Clean Up their Mistakes.","The Glass of Water[Author Unknown]A psychologist was teaching stress management to a large audience. As she walked around the room, she held a glass of water out in front of her.As she raised the glass high for everyone to see, they expected her to ask the ""half empty, or half full"", question.Instead, with a smile on her face, she asked, ""How heavy is this glass of water?""The answers that were called out from the crowd ranged anywhere from 8 to 20 ounces.She replied, ""The absolute weight of this glass really doesn't matter —so much depends on how long I hold it:If I hold it for a minute, it isn't a problem.If I hold it for an hour, I'll get a muscle cramp in my arm.But, if I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb, maybe even paralyzed.In each case, the weight of the glass doesn't change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.""She continued, ""The stresses and worries in life are just like this glass of water:Think about them for a little while and nothing happens.Think about them a bit longer, and they begin to hurt.And, if you think about them all day long, you will feel paralyzed and incapable of doing anything about them at all.""It's important that we remember to let go of our stresses and not carry our burdens through the evening and into the night.We have to remember ... to put the glass down."
CAT Exam,How can I make my cat like other people besides myself?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-make-my-cat-like-other-people-besides-myself,"Cats (domestic), Common Admission Test (CAT), Pets",13,"I can’t make my cat do anything!Anecdotally, though, my cat tends to be a good judge of character. My blond force of nature (the boyfriend) is a huge mao* lover, and natural mao whisperer. Usually, I am Ms. Eden’s designated royal bumrest and personal servant.But whenever BFON comes over, Ms. Eden looks at me with disdain, and deliberately picks her way over to him, where she promply plops down as an indication that she would like to be petted (that traitor mao). We always joke that he will charm her away from me one day.Picture of Eden being a traitor mao with the BFONOn the contrary, she bit someone I knew, who turned out to be manipulative and controlling.Also, my mother recently threw a dinner party for her birthday, in which people were being noisy, rude, and disrespectful (refused to take off their shoes, even after I explained that we mop the floor regularly and that they could potentially really hurt my cat, who likes to sit behind people.) Ms. Eden sulked under the table for almost the entire duration the guests were at my house.Ms. Eden and her grumpy face.In essence, much like what other people have been saying- cats will like whomever they choose to like, and -at least for my cat- they often have good reasons for doing so.*A mao is a Chinese cat.","First of all you cannot “make” your cat do anything. Cats are cats and need to be respected as such.I recently wrote an article on training your cat to be a Therapy Cat and this goes in to great detail on how to “socialize” your cat as this is a skill required of all therapy cats.My cat and I are a registered therapy animal team. I would suggest you read this article and follow the guidelines to see IF your cat is willing to socialize with others. Notice I say “IF”.https://www.tailsofkalima.com/ca...If you follow the guidelines and your cat is not sociable with anyone but you then you will have to accept that. Each cat and their history is a unique being, must be respected as such. All animals deserve our love, kindness and patience.All the best to you and your kitty! Happy tails to you…. :)","Most cats like people, unless they were not handled by humans when they were kittens. Just tell your friends or guests not to interact with your cat, let your cat come to them and make sure to tell them to hold their hand out so your cat can sniff them, if they are receptive your cat will most likely rub their head against their hand, which is your cats way of saying it's all good.","I would suggest treats. Have your friend sit quietly on the floor & place the treat where your cat can find it. Might have to make it a special treat. It should now have your friend's scent on it. Then your friend can offer her hand to the cat. Not to touch the cat but to let it sniff her hand. A lot depends on chemistry and personality. My three legged rescue adores my son. When he's near her she rears up & offers her one front leg to him. As is she's saying to him, “Carry me. I just have three legs.” To other people she is aloof. Preferring to sit back and stare at them."
CAT Exam,"During the analysis of my CAT mock, especially for quant, I am able to solve 22-26 questions, but while taking the mock, I am stuck to 10-12 questions. How can I improve?",https://www.quora.com//During-the-analysis-of-my-CAT-mock-especially-for-quant-I-am-able-to-solve-22-26-questions-but-while-taking-the-mock-I-am-stuck-to-10-12-questions-How-can-I-improve,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",8,"Thanks for A2A Gaurang.You need to read the questions fast in the exam hall. Immediately leave the question if you are not sure of how to solve it post the first reading. Do not try to understand by investing more time on it.Doing this, run through the paper till the end. You would have selected all easy ones for you and solved them. On this ruthless journey to the end, you should bookmark the questions that you think you can solve but can be time consuming. Get back to these question if time permits.If you follow this basic process, you can get up from 10–12 to 18–20 questions. The key lies in not wasting time on the questions that need to be left - the difficult ones for you. Let me illustrate this doing some basic maths.Suppose, you read and double read questions to try to solve them. You read 26 questions - solve 12 and leave 14 after trying to solve them. So, effectively 60/26 => 2.3 minutes per question (assume same time for both solved and unsolved/wrong ones) => 14*2.3 approx 32 minutes wasted.So, the key lies in spending time on those questions which you can solve and immediately leaving the ones that confuse you in the hall. Practice this. Being conscious about fast selection leads to lots of improvement in attempts and accuracy both.My team and I will be discussing mock analysis in details in this free all India mock series for CAT 2018. You can register for this prediction mock series on this link:CAT 2018 Feel CAT SeriesBest wishes!Rahul SirCAT Coachwww.bfactory.in","A2AThe only difference between solving questions after the test and during the test is the accompanying pressure. When you are taking the test, there are stakes involved: you are probably thinking about the score, accuracy, cut-offs and percentile. There are no such distractions once you are attempting the questions with a clearer mind (also, there is no fatigue as would be the case during the test; attempting quant after those 2 gruelling hours is an arduous task, no doubt) and that generally helps focus a bit better.The best thing you can do in this situation is to think of one question at a time and not the macro picture when you are attempting the test. If you tend to count the number of reds and greens when you are solving a question or are obsessively looking at the timer every 30 seconds or so, you would need to break this habit. The best candidates will invariably tell you that they are confident in their ability and that it is their attempt that will define the level of difficulty and not the other way around (in simpler words, if they are unable to attempt a question after a minute of struggle, they are smart enough to understand that more than 90% of the test-taking population won’t be able to solve it and so, skip it without any second thoughts). The key to doing justice to the test lies in being aggressive and fearless when you are solving every question.So, instead of worrying about your mock scores, use the mocks to get better at the actual test. Read the question carefully, solve it using the first method that comes to your mind (if you got nothing in 45 seconds, move on) and do not make any calculation errors. Repeat this 34 times and you should get a better outcome. Sounds arbitrary but it actually works in most cases when content is not an issue (which, I am assuming is true in your case considering that you are able to solve around 70 percent of the test).Hope that helps.","This is a very normal occurrence for quite a few students.It is very natural. This happens because your mind has already seen all the questions and whether you like it or not, the questions or the roadblocks or their concepts lurk in your mind and then when you solve it again, you seem to solve more.In a mock, you look at the questions for the first time and have to read them, absorb them, calculate, process it for the first time. This means that you need time to read, interpret, comprehend, understand and solve the problem.The way to move over this problem is to practice regularly and continuously. Give sectional tests and mocks frequently. This is because it will improve your retention, comprehension and solving speed and skills.If you ever feel that a particular topic and section is becoming tough and that you are repeatedly making mistakes in it, then the best option is to give sectional tests and practice beforehand wherein you read all the concepts, solve all the questions of all the levels of difficulty.For example, I always feel that geometry and P&C have always been my achilles heel. So, if I ever score low in quant or in LR, I double down from Arun Sharma books and the coaching reference books. This gives me confidence and allows me to go over the concepts once again. The surprising thing I have noticed is that many a times there have been cases where I forget few tips and tricks related to the concepts I have already brushed over. I usually then go beyond the trick, have a look at its reasoning and the method for the trick. For example, for finding remainder I always imagine doing it using the binomial theorem — this is because I can never imagine the other tips and tricks. For the mixtures portion, I always go by the LCM approach — this I do because I cannot visualise or calculate using the tricks. So, I know what works for me or what I am able to use.Never stick to one method just because it is easy —- being easy is a very subjective term.All the best!","When we come across with any friendly person, we feel very good. We would like to spend as much time with that person. Those individuals just make us feel extremely comfortable. But life is not a bed of roses. Many a times we have to confront individuals, perceived as not so friendly or may be deadly, whose thought processes are totally diametrically opposite ours. The process of interaction with such individuals, at times, can take an ugly shape of confrontation. We may tend to get so emotionally engrossed that the chances of getting almost intellectually paralyzed are very high. Brain just freezes. Mind goes numb. We may not be able to analyze the things objectively -as expected of a rational being. We just want to win our argument at any cost. And when that does not happen, our pride gets battered and bruised badly.But then, time is a great healer. We may have been pained by that individual/situation. But, over a period of time, we tend to forget that and we just move on with our regular daily set of activities. In fact, many a times, the converse happens. When we analyze those situations (when we are in cool frame of mind), the following thought processes tend to resonate.Oh ! I should not have done that.Oh ! How silly of me.Oh ! Why did i behave so inappropriately with that individual. It was just so ungentlemanly of me !Well, I think I should have behaved in a proper way.Essentially, many a times, when we try and recollect those incidents, we realize that was our own folly. But then, a price has already been paid. We may have lost that individual. But then, it’s life. We will come across with hundreds and thousands of individuals but with mindset different from ours.The fundamental questions are:->“Have we really learned enough from that first nasty confrontation so that the same can be avoided later on”. ?“Are we sure that we will be able to deal with those so called unfriendly individuals in a better way next time”?“Have we really learned from our mistakes “ ?“Can we maintain our cool and calm during pressure like scenarios”And that’s what CAT MOCKs are trying to teach us. The MOCKs are presenting to us lots of situations -some good, some nasty and some utterly disgusting. During the test time, sometimes we are not able to spot a friendly easy question. Instead we tend to spend a lot of time wrestling with a question which should have been ignored on the mere looks of it. But we tend to fight with that during the test time and if we were blessed with infinte time, most likely we would fight with that till eternity.In my last 14 years of coaching for CAT, I had interacted with thousands of CAT aspirants. It is very difficult to say what is a right formula to crack QUANT. What works for one person may not work for the other individual. Everyone is unique. There is no standard formula which can be applied everywhere.When we are writing MOCKs, there is that huge time pressure. We would have to learn as to how to handle that pressure. When we can maintain cool and calm, our ability to spot easy questions and do those correctly will multiply. Further, we will be effective in identifying torturous qs and ignore those quickly. But this brings forth another key point“If we were blessed with excellent time/pressure managment skills, can we do a large number of questions on the basis of those skills alone” ?Well, the answer is plain, simple NO.So, the question is what are those other skills which we should be endowed with and what we should do for that.There are some broad pointers/factors which we should be aware of.During the test time, don’t spend unnecessary amount of time on questions which are difficult. Such questions are meant to be left out. But, Yes !! During preparation stage, one should make a conscious attempt to learn relevant concepts and different techniques for cracking such questions.During the preparation stage, don’t leave out any chapter completely.There are around 25–26 chapters where the questions have been coming across in CAT for the past 10 years. For the sake of convenience, we can divide the entire CAT QUANT portion in two broad categories -1) FRIENDLY areas in QUANT 2) DEADLY areas in QUANTFollowing is a hypothetical scenario. Pls note that what appears “friendly” for one may be “deadly” for other.FRIENDLY Areas in QUANT (for a candidate X):->There are around 7–8 topics which a candidate X may feel comfortable with. Those topics are 1) Simple Equations 2) Ratio, Proportion, Variation 3) Percentages 4) Profit, Loss, Partnership 5) SICI 6) Averages, Mixtures and Alligations 7) Time & Work 8) Time & Distance. These topics are generally “perceived” to be less painful.There were 14–15 questions from the above mentioned areas in CAT 2017If anyone is out of touch with MATHS, the chances are very high that one will like to focus on ONLY the topics as mentioned above.DEADLY AREAS in QUANT(for that candidate X)There are other 15–16 chapters where that canddiate X may not feel comfortable with. These chapters may not appear as friendly as the ones mentioned earlier on. Qs from chapters like 1) Numbers -LCM, HCF, Remainders, etc 2) Geometry 3) Mensuration 4) Special Equations 5) Inequalities 6) Functions & Graphs 7) Coordinate Geometry 8) P&C 9) Probability 10) Indices & Surds 11) Logarithms 12) Trigonometry 13) Number Systems -Binary, Hexadecimal System 14) Quadratic Equations 15) Progressions 16) Statistics are very common place.Last year, there were around 19–20 qs from the above mentioned areas.It’s clear that the candidate X has less exposure. The chances are high that he will spend more time on qs which are from his friendly domain. But the number of qs from such areas will be limited in the exam-may be 15. As a consequence, during the test time, the number of attempts will get restricted to less than 15.And later on we realize that we could have done about 22 qs.Why does that feeling occur.Because, when we are doing that analysis, we are doing in a cool frame of mind. All deadly qs (during the test time) have started appearing friendly (during the analysis time).Let me present to you one example. This question is actually related to “Permutation & Combination”. Sometimes, the very mention of this topic can unsettle even a seasoned professional.Here goes the question.(Difficulty level of the question posed below is left for you to decide for)There are 13 players. Each player plays exactly one match with every other player. Find the total number of matches held.Ans:->When we apply P&C, we can get the answer by applying 13C2. Now, when we are not comfortable with the chapter, we may feel like leaving that question during then exam. But there is other way to look at this question -PATTERN METHOD.Take the following cases.:A, B (Matches held —-> AB)3 Persons:-> A, B, C(Matches held)AB, AC (2)BC (1)Total:-> 1+24 Persons:-> A, B, C, D(Matches held)AB, AC, AD (3)BC, BD (2)CD (1)Total: 1+2 +3 =65 Persons:-> A, B, C, D , E(Matches held)AB, AC, AD, AE (4)BC, BD, BE (3)CD, CE (2)DE(1)Total: 1+2 +3 +4=10Observing the pattern, we can say that the number of matches heldMatches = 1+2+3 +4……+12 = 78Let’s understand the bigger picture. During the exam, there will be easy qs-like the one above (Matches qs) (from so called difficult chapters).So, how do we spot those. During the preparation phase, we have to solve a large number of qs from various chapters so that we are not taken by surprise. Practice and a never say die attitude matters.We need to keep our mind open. Let’s enter the exam hall with our mind clear of any prejudices. If we can do that, CAT should not be a difficult one to crack.You can follow the link below for additional pointers related to CAT QUANT preparation.Rajesh Kumar Saraf's answer to What are some of the important tricks used for solving the quants section in the CAT exam?All the best !!"
CAT Exam,What is more important in the CAT mocks: percentile or actual score? What should be taken as a parameter for judging the performance?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-more-important-in-the-CAT-mocks-percentile-or-actual-score-What-should-be-taken-as-a-parameter-for-judging-the-performance,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",5,"It depends.Percentile and actual score both are important in case of CAT mocks.If number of mock takers are more and the difficulty level of mock is upto actual CAT paper than both percentile and actual score is important. If number of test takers are less than actual score is only important.A lots of mock test series available in market and all aspirants not enrolled with same test series so we can not give more importance to percentile. So finally i can say “Actual score is more important in CAT mocks”.Analysis yourself by mock test is the most important thing. You can identify your weak and strong area by these mocks. There are many Mock test series available now the days who give the complete analysis of your mock like weak area, strong area. Click on the give link- Mock Test Series for CAT, XAT, NMAT, SNAP, IBPS PO and SBI PO . This mock will provide a complete analysis after every mock.Analysis every mock on your side also and Keep following points in your mind during this-Focus on the number of errors made. Try to minimize errors, they don’t have more than 2 in QA section, not more than 2 in LRDI section, not more than 20% in VARC section. If you are doing more error than this number means you are also attempting those question also whom your are not 100% sure.Look beyond scores and percentiles. Score and percentile is just a number, they might make you feel good or bad but you have to look beyond this.Attempt the entire paper again. An average CAT aspirant attempts 50–60 question in mock mean they have miss out a large number of good questions. Re-attempt it again without time pressure.Analyze your question, set, passage selection. After re-attempt the mock evaluate yourself on those parameters- Did I attempt the correct questions in Quant?, Did I pick the right sets in LR/DI?, Did I pick the right passages in RC? etc in my first attempt.Identify the strategy that works best for you. Follow a strategy that will help you to solve more question. According to me attempt every section in two phases. In phase 1 attempt all easy question that you can solve easily in less time and mark those question that can be solved by you but they take more time. In phase 2 attempt all marked question. This strategy will sure you that you don’t leave any easy question.Figure out the number of mocks you need. Attempt at-least 10 mocks before CAT exam.Do not attempt section wise mock. Always attempt full length mocks. Because full length mocks will feel you actual exam not section wise mock.Identify your weak areas. After analysis 2–3 mocks, you will identify your weak areas and than work out on that before attempting next mock.Check if you are slipping in your strong areas. Some time this happen when you are over confident on your strong area and don’t give enough time to this. You can identify this during identify weak area. This should not be happen, if this is happen than work out on it also.Plan your next mock. After a mock analysis you can allot time for your weak area, other thing etc than schedule next mock.If you are looking Online Course for CAT preparation than go through this link- Online CAT Coaching Course for CAT 2018 Exam PreparationGood luck for your bright future.Jai Hind!","A2AStandalone, neither is of absolute importance in my opinion.As is the case with CAT, the mocks also tell you where you stand with regard to the test taking population. However, the sample set is so concentrated that it is impossible to draw valid conclusions from your mock percentiles alone. The number of serious takers forms a big percentage of the total number of people taking mocks (roughly 50% or even more if fewer people are taking a test). In case of the CAT however, there will be around 75–80 percent of the population that doesn’t prepare seriously in any capacity. So, while you might start from a 50 percentile level in your mock, you effectively start at a 75 percentile level at the CAT.With regard to absolute scores, it completely depends on the level of difficulty of each section and while most of the mocks tend to be close to the previous CAT, or slightly tougher, there would generally be a few mocks that try to sensitize you to uncommon scenarios (which, is of course a good practice because you never know what the CAT would look like that year). So, again we cannot really say that if you get X marks in a mock, it would translate into a Y at the CAT.The takeaway in my opinion is more of decision making than anything else. Throughout the mock taking phase, your focus should be on identifying easy and difficult questions as quickly as possible thereby optimizing the time you would have. The content part plays a support role in making sure that you solve the easy and moderate questions using the shortest possible method. The best candidates out there are the ones who can decide extremely quickly if a question deserves their attention or not (in fact that was exactly the theme of CAT 2018 in case you haven’t seen the analysis yet).So, to sum it up, try to build at least basic content before the mock season starts (you might want to attempt a handful of past CAT papers to understand what all topics are frequently tested) and test your decision making in the actual mocks. As you progress, you can improve your preparation from a section level (for example: VA/QA/LR is my strongest/weakest section) to a topic level (for example: PnC/Geometry/Numbers is my strongest/weakest topic) to a question level (for example: replacement in a mixtures question is something I am not comfortable with).Hope that helps.","Hi SamridhiI believe two things that matter the most in tracking one’s performance are:PercentileAccuracyScore can fluctuate based on the level of the paper but the percentile should remain consistently at the required mark as per your preparation and expectations or go higher as per plans. Similarly, number of attempts can go up or down depending on the level of the paper, but what matters most is your accuracy. Not saying these parameters are the only ones that matter: speed, selection, number of attempts etc. are also important; but my top two picks to monitor one’s performance are percentile and accuracy.Best wishesIf you want to attend a CAT 19–20 strategy meet in Delhi, you can join this event: Invitations, Free eCards and Party Planning Ideas from Evite","The score matters more than the percentile. The percentile is based on what others do. And, the students who take mocks of a certain institute can not accurately reflect the those who are going to take the actual CAT.And, when you look at the score , you realize that there is always a scope for improvement. It always keeps on your toes. It makes you strive harder and harder.So the score matters more…But ultimately the analysis of your performance matters more than the score. Knowing the mistakes that you have done in mocks will help you do better in the actual CAT."

The following explains it clearly.A total score of above 37+ is necessary to make it XLRI, Jamshedpur. Sectional Cut-off should be in the range ofVALR: 8-12DM: 9-10QADI: 10-11XAT 2017 GK focused more on Geography, but to do well in this section be up to date with everything happening around you (last 5-6 months), Economy, Personality and Awards, History etc.Essay Writing requires practice. Language, Grammar, Concept and Structure is very important. Spend about 20 mins on this section and write well.To achieve these sectional cut-offs:1. Be thorough with basics.2. Solve previous years papers to understand the kind of questions that come3. Focus more on the XAT exclusive questions, especially Decision Making. It is perceived as a subjective section and is therefore, tough.4. Take sectional tests. This will help you understand which your strong section is and which area to improve. This will help you know which section gives you a competitive edge.5. Take mocks. Learn to analyse each mock properly. One must know their strong and weak areas and work on them with dedication.http://catking.in/xat-mocks/6. Let’s not make random guesswork. It is only going to reduce your score. If you see a question, and you have no idea at all, LEAVE IT. If you feel you can do it but end up wasting more than 2 minutes then KEEP YOUR EGO ASIDE and move to the next one!7. Towards the end increase the rate of taking mocks.8. For Verbal section, read the Editorials of newspapers. This will help for Essay writing too. The following video will give you a few insights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...9. General Awareness is a scary section for most. Make wise choices.

Clearing Sectional cut-off is mandatory.Staying calm and composed is the most important ingredient to achieve 99%.All the Best!!","I scored 99.7+ three times (XAT 2011-2013). Trust me when I say this -once get a hang of how the test works, you don't need much preparation. However your basics need to be strong, especially in language.Your XAT score is more about how you handle the three hours of the test than how much you have prepared over the last year.I'll try to make this concise. You'll need the following.A good vocabulary & reading comprehension. Learn to read fast. Learn new words every day. This takes time to build, but once you have, half your work  is done. XAT questions(even quant questions) use a lot more 'language'  than the other B-School entrance tests.Speed. One needs to be able to solve 90 problems in 2-2.5 hours. Believe me, each one of those is a ten minute problem. Your best allies in this area are: Confidence, speed reading, and ability to do fast mental math, especially approximations. The second and third are obvious, but where confidence comes in is- you might have the fastest brain in the whole world, but if you keep re-checking your answers to be sure, trust me you're going nowhere with XAT. Plus, confidence helps you take risks. You'll need that too. Make educated guesses. Eliminate options, and if it comes down to one out of two, guess. Odds are still in your favour. Attempt as many as you can. I had over 90% attempts in all the years. Make sure you're attacking the test, not defending yourself in the examination hall. Stay calm. Never panic. A little adrenalin is okay, but stay calm. Breathe, do yoga/pranayam/tai chi or whatever shit you need to do, but get your shit together. Do not fuss too much over one question or section. Manage your time well.Be good. Be honest. Do the right thing. See both sides of any story. Be mature. Remember ""for the greater good"". Aaand you'll be through the dreaded decision making. XAT is tuned towards selecting a certain kind of people(rather, people with certain kind of thinking). And for a bloody good reason. And again, always move fast. That's all I can think of now.I'll update if I can think of anything else.PS: The thing about XAT is that everyone thinks it is difficult. And that's exactly why its easy to crack.","I got 99.18 in XAT 2014. Here are few things I did.My CAT didn't go that great so I was pretty crestfallen before writing XAT that year. However in that duration of two months I gave two mock XATs and went through the solutions of all previous year Decision making questions. Believe me it helps a lot to know the approach for solving DM questions. 90% times the answer to the decision making question is something you feel is ethically correct and is very true in an ideal world. Also for Quant there is no requirement for mugging up of formulas. You need to be fast with putting numbers in the question for hit and trial. Just approach every question in a very elementary fashion. Don't even try to use heavy fundas , just focus on basics. For verbal , practice previous years questions and be very quick in reading passages and other short questions.Furthermore, on the test day I did the following:I was very fast in reading all questions. I have a poor concentration level so i switch sections in every 10-15 mins to optimise my ability. Additionally, I always attempt short questions first. For Decision making i always go for 100%attempt. Believe me it helps a lot, as this section is fun and all you need to do is to just read coolly and tick the answer considering yourself the most moral person on this planet Earth :P . Coming to the Quant part I always attempt short questions with least number of lines first. I sieve out those questions in which I find the scope of replacing options to get the answer. I rarely attempt DI part because they are way too much time taking. Remember in quant even if your going for low attempts but if have high accuracy you are good to go. I generally have 100% accuracy so i don't go for unnecessary attempts. All in all , just stay calm on the test day and don't ever consider the paper as your life. It is just an exam which is a matter of the day.","Thanks A2aIf one follow proper strategy and study material then it is easy to score good percentile in MBA entrance exams. XAT exam is prestigious entrance exam for MBA candidates after CAT.These are important strategies to score the 99 percentile inXAT:1. Take coaching and as well as do the self-study: Take the coaching from the best coaching center and then do the self-study also. Because cracking the XAT/ CAT exam without proper preparation is almost impossible and most of the candidates have cracked the XAT/ CAT examination without the coaching also but the only difference is the dedication and the hard work and the self-study. These three play an important role in cracking the XAT/ CAT examination.Self-study plays an important role to get an edge on others, to self study you need some notes so that you can understand and revise things in short period of time.If you are doing self study only without joining coaching center then you can go for CAT/ XAT exam Study material, this set contains various pdf of some well known books and Notes. But if you didn`t need complete set then you will surely go for Full Mathematics Study Material.2. Never take the negative things into the mind because cracking the CAT/ XAT examination is not that tough but if you start thinking that the examination is tough and is difficult to crack then this will be a big blunder. You cannot go ahead with this thinking. So first make yourself sure that you can crack the examination and then start preparing for the examination at this stage only you can see the speed of solving the questions and the accuracy in you.3. In order to get the 99+ percentile in the CAT/ XAT examination you have to give equal importance to all the sections this is important because if you are scoring 99+ percentage marks in one section and in the another section such as the data interpretation you are scoring 60 percentage marks then this will create a problem for you in scoring the 99+ percentile in the CAT/ XAT examination so just concentrate on each and every section.4. Take mock tests: Based on the mock test result only your performance in the CAT/ XAT examination can be assumed because these mock tests give the accurate result of the level of speed of solving the questions and the accuracy. And your only duty is to analyze yourself and then start finding your weak areas and then start working on it. In this way, you can analyze your preparation and where you are lagging.5. Find tricks to solve questions easily: Even though they are providing the calculators in the CAT/ XAT Exam candidates should not depend on the calculators for each and every question and the calculation part they should learn some shortcut tricks in order improve the speed of solving the questions in many coaching centers they will teach you the important and easy shortcut tricks. So in order to get proper time management and the accuracy these tricks are more important.Finally, follow the above strategies properly in order to get 80+ percentile score in the CAT/ XAT examination. The tricks and the speed of solving the questions in the examination can be obtained just by practicing the more number of question papers and also solving the different models of questions in the important topics.Source- CAT/ MAT/ XAT: Strategy to Score 99 Percentile"

Important CAT Preparation Tips!As bells start ringing for the approaching CAT exam, all the students want to know How to crack CAT in 2 months? Moreover, with the new pattern of CAT exam, strategies will need to change. The ideal approach to score high in MBA entrance exams is true to the age old saying of “Work hard for what you want because it won’t come to you without a fight.”To bell the CAT, you need to know its nature. There is still no clarification on the proposed changes in CAT pattern.There will be 34, 32, 34 questions respectively in Quantitative aptitude (QA), Data interpretation and logical reasoning (DILR), Verbal and reading comprehension (VRC). Apart from multiple choice questions, there will even be non MCQs.There could be more data interpretation questions or more quant ones. In the second section the questions ratio of verbal ability and reading comprehension against logical reasoning may also change. As there is no official word on this, we have to be prepared for any pattern.The new preparation strategy for CATA lot will be decided by the CAT practice test hosted by IIMs at CAT 2018. Despite taking n number of mock tests by coaching institutes, the final word will be said by this official CAT mock test. We will need to wait a little longer for this to be available though.In our opinion, in the last two months you need to focus on two things – (1) Topic wise revision, (2) Mock tests.It goes without saying that if you have not already started revising, it is high time to do so. Give in more hours in a day, know your strengths and weaknesses, and just give it all.Be prepared for anything and everything!The uncertainty of pattern is wreaking havoc among CAT aspirants. But look at it this way, you are all in the same boat. So rather than preparing based on pattern, prepare for topics. There could be an imbalance in number of questions being divided among sections. But as long as you are equally good in all, it will not make a difference.Divide your time among the two major sections and four sub sections wisely. If you are exceptionally good in one, give it a little lesser time and try to improve the areas you are not so good at. You do not want to lose precious marks in any section!Go back to the basicsThe USP of CAT or any MBA entrance exam is that it does not involve rocket science. The topics are of basic mathematics and aptitude. Aim of any management entrance exam is to test a candidate’s aptitude and problem solving ability. As long as you know the fundamentals like the back of your hand, there is no looking back.Preparing for basic English questions in CAT – To justly increase number of questions and to let students solve them in lesser time, there could be a rise in questions on basic English. This could include more speech, tenses, word formations, phrasal verbs.Logical reasoning – On any given day, LR questions take up more time in a paper. Racing against time, you need to solve LR questions tactically. Remember, incorrect answers will give you a negative score. Practice more questions on seating arrangements, relations, sets, premise and conclusion. Focus on improving your speed and accuracy.Quantitative Ability – Remainder theorem, geometry, number system, PC, probability; these are your friends for life. Or at least for CAT. As a large number of engineering students appear for the CAT exam, it is expected that this section is the most scoring. Like basic english, questions of quant are also expected to be more.Data Interpretation – Learn to visually understand data. Graphs, pie charts, bar diagrams are all information rich data being presented as graphs. Graphs are meant to make things easier to understand. You will need to understand this fact before moving ahead with these questions. DI section is scoring for those who have the knack of breaking down visual data into information.Speed and accuracy – That is all you need to get the perfect score in CAT!Solve questions quickly, and correctly.Rather than trying to learn concepts, you can start doing questions from the beginning.Do not spend a long time in just knowing a concept. Start practicing its approach in questions.Two months before appearing for CAT exam, you must know which are your weak and strong areas.If you are yet unable to understand the weak topics, do not spend a very long time on them.Start further strengthening your strong areas. Try to solve those questions in lesser time.",As per the eligiblity criteria .Yes you can appear for CAT 2018 .

CAT Exam,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam.

CAT Exam,Is the CAT a tough exam?,https://www.quora.com//Is-the-CAT-a-tough-exam,Common Admission Test (CAT),57,"Okay. I am going to post a different reply here. By ‘different’ I mean its not the usual success story that you commonly see from CAT toppers where they have cracked the exam within 2 attempts with just under 6 months of preparation.You have many websites for those success stories - GPkafunda.com, Careers 360 and MBA UNiverse. Websites like these post only the story of the toppers. You hardly get to hear the other side of the story if you follow only what they have to say. And why not?. If they start doing so, then their market would vanish overnight.I am going to follow the words of our late President APJ Abdul Kalam-“Dont read success stories, you get only the message. Read failure stories, you get ideas to success”and going to give a more realistic picture of this exam.As a person who has been bitten by this exam 4 times- I feel I have to give out my opinion when I saw this question come up in my feed.The straight answer to this question is- YES. CAT is tough. But the word ‘tough’ has got nothing to do with the content or the syllabus or the preparation.CAT- being a competitive exam, suffers from the same three shortcomings that almost all other competitive exams in India( like GATE, IBPS, IITJEE, AIEEE, UPSC) suffer from- competition, reservation and irrational admission criteria.Its important to know about these three things before you attempt this test.Heavy competition: About 2 lakh people on an average give CAT every year. And guess how many seats are there in all IIMs put together?. Just 4000. Is it not fair to say that the odds are always stacked up against you?. This is one factor which will always bring you down. You can think that you are well prepared. But there will be atleast 20 people who are probably more well prepared than you. This is not unique to CAT, but its unique to any government level entrance exam in India.Reservation: Now, dont get me wrong. I know its there because of social justice and all. And I am not asking anyone to cite reservation as an excuse in case you fail. But, even an SC student will find it difficult to an extent as the cut-off for the top IIMs would still be >90 percentile. You can check it here- http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/users....Admission criteria: A lot of B-schools look at your 10th , 12th scores as a pre-requisite. This is very unfair- IMO. Because you may not have performed well in your 10th Boards due to a variety of reasons. For example- my grand-dad died just 2 days before my 12th Board exams were to start. It was a painful experience for me as he was quite close. As a result- I could not concentrate much. Luckily I managed to score 93% overall aggregate. And my brother had developed a sudden viral fever during his 10th Boards. He could not concentrate for the first few days.Apart from these three factors, there is one which is unique to CAT- the normalization process. This used to be a big deal till CAT 2013. Since there are multiple slots, there is a possibility that one slot might have had a relatively easier question set compared to others. Thus the scores of the easier slots are normalized to a scaled standardized score out of 450 and then you are ranked based on that. And how this normalization is done- remains a million dollar question.And none of these factors are under your control. How is your 10th performance supposed to be a deciding factor in your selection?. Your social circumstances could have been different. Your level of schooling would have been different, your guidance and financial status would have been different. All these are NOT taken into account by the top IIMs.Point is- to eliminate the heavy competition, B- schools use these tricks as a means of filtering out students.Now coming to the much hyped ‘difficulty level’ of CAT. I think that this is probably where most success stories you hear from toppers are centered around. The actual syllabus is just elementary maths and English. And its not that difficult to solve these questions once you remove the three factors I mentioned above.I tried a simple experiment. I gave some 10 questions from one of the previous AIMCAT papers to the son of my next-door-neighbour, who is studying in Class 11. He solved all 10 of them correctly within 15 mins!!.And AIMCAT is regarded as one of the toughest CAT prep series conducted by TIME.Why was he able to solve when most of us cant?. Because he is in touch with the syllabus, when most of us are not. Thats the key ingredient you must know.There are three sections in CAT according to the latest 2015 pattern.SECTION- 1: VERBAL ABILITY and READING COMPREHENSIONThis contains a lot of commie level type of passages. The kind you commonly find in editorials of newspapers like the Economic Times, NYT and the Hindu. Most of them would be centered around some topics like - economics, art history, Greek literature, language and semantics, ancient civilizations etc… Atmost 70- 80% of the passages are from these areas. You can read newspapers editorials to get the hang of it. Or else you can try Arts & Letters Daily .SECTION- 2: LOGICAL REASONING and DATA INTERPRETATIONI just hate this section- to tell you the truth. I mean all these complex kinds of bar-graphs and pie-charts , the amount of mind-boggling data you have to process manually. I find this section the most irrelevant. In my experience of the real world- there are scientific calculators and any chart can be easily computed today using Microsoft Excel formulae. Thats how its being done in most organizations. I really feel that this section should be done away with- or atleast we can give a reduced weightage.But what I really like about this section is that its fun. Total fun when you remove the time constraint. And the next best thing is that you need not require any knowledge on complex formula- like you have to remember for Quant related topics. All you have to do is to understand the data given and correlate the various graphs. Most of the questions in this section could be solved when you tabulate all the data in a single table or a single graph.SECTION-3: QUANTITATIVE ABILITY:Probably the most easiest of all. Some may be surprised at this, because they are most likely to have forgotten what they have learnt in their 10th and 12th Maths. But the NCERT books can really be a good foundation with which you can attempt this section. Questions asked are from the following areas.Geometry and Mensuration- Questions on circles, triangles, polygons and properties.Permutation and Probability- Selection, arrangements.Number Theory- Remainder Theorem, Factor theorem.Progressions- AP, GP, HP, Number series.Algebra- equations, functions and graphs.Business Maths- Profit and Loss, SI& CI, RPVs etc…Most of these topics can be found in NCERT text books or you can even refer your old Maths book- if you still have it. Once you have written all the basic formula in a paper, you can easily tabulate them accordingly as to when you should apply which formula.Once this is done- you can solve a lot of sectional tests Probably the most important step. Most are available for free- if you are going with self-study.Or you can enroll in one the coaching centers and take them too- this is the best course for first-timers.But even after doing all this- you have to be prepared for the worst. Like I said before- if you think you are prepared, there are atleast 20 more people who are more well-prepared than you.The difference between the absolute raw scores( not scaled scores) of a 90 percentiler and a 100 percentiler might not be much( most probably a difference of 50–70 marks, going by what I used to analyze with my mock scores). And percentile ranking is flawed to an extent. Its a ranking system - just a relative score and not an absolute way to judge your talent.In summary: Yes, CAT is tough and unique- in its own respect. It has got its own share of flaws too. Its foolish to compare it with JEE/GATE and say that its easier. Its like comparing apples with oranges.","CAT isn’t difficult at all . It is an exam which tests your coolness and decision making power. CAT is all about choosing the right question and leaving a question if it takes much time of yours(Only by constant practice,u can increase the speed and choose the right question).And you should also understand that the colleges doesn’t consider your score and they consider your percentile only. The main reason for failure in cat is the “aspirants ego”(Don’t mistake me guys).Because we test takers, when we did not get the solution for an easy question, we get tensed and try to solve that question, which may eat up our valuable minutes.Strategy to be followed acc. to my point of view:If u r strong in basics then ok; else clear your basics of q,v,r in a month or two(one month is actually enough).Then start solving aimcat test series(Note: Need not solve all qns in ur course books; start aimcat asap)Understand the concepts from course books and then start solving the aimcat series from January itself(THIS IS IMPORTANT: pls pls start aimcat from jan itself; even if u dint complete ur course books).And don’t ever skip any aimcat. Taking aimcat is important but the more imp. thing is reviewing your aimcat papers thoroughly before giving your next aimcat .Reviewing is not all about understanding the “no idea” qns alone. It’s about finding the shortcuts for each qns and sticking to the fastest way of solving the qns. And it’s also important to read the newspapers daily in order to improve ur vocabulary, reading speed(words per min needs to be increased drastically).It helps a lot in GD too.","Is CAT exam really tough? It just might be and at the same time, it might not be. How? Simple, not all humans are same and not everyone have same logical and metal aptitude. Not everyone is preparing the same way you are, Not everyone have been disciplined enough to prepare, Not everyone have their basics clear or have a good vocabulary skills.It is up to you to decide where to land and where do you want to see yourself. Lets take a quick peek at what CAT is,Quant 1.Basic Quant: 12 to 14 questions, This section accounts for Maths that we learn in our 6–9th grades. These contain basic topics like percentages Profit/Loss and what not. Now it depends for person to person on how much time allocation needs to be. Books like Rd Sharma are enough for this section.2.Data Interpretation: 15 to 17 questions, This section is all about reading charts and graphs and analysing the data given , and hence it does not require much practisce until you are like a year to give your exam3.Data Sufficiency : 2 to 3 questions4.Geometry and Algebra : 17 to 18 questions: This is a slightly more tougher topic and you will need some certain professional help in order to master this part of the paper. I would highly recommend you buy correspondence packs of institutions like TIME etc.Verbal 1.Reading Comprehensions: 15 to 17 questions: To improve this part one must read read an dread. There is no shortcut to master RC’s. It is preferable that you read 500–600 passages as part of the preparation as that is the idle size of an RC expected in the paper itself. As you will read for days you will notice that your reading time per passage is decreasing and you will slowly learn the way of speed reading.2. Logical Reasoning: 15 to 17 Questions: These questions are very basic conceptual based algorithms which you have already prbably done in many Olympiads and stuff, no extra practice must go into it if you have a high aptitude.3. Paragraph Completion/Sentence Rearrangement/ Sentence elimination: 3 questions: This involves deep knowledge of grammar and hence I would recommend you to go through the book called Wren and Martin. Grammar will take time to improve and dont stop your practice once you think that you are thorough enough instead keep practicing this till the last day.4.Text Completion/Word Usage:3 questions: For this high vocab skill set is required and I would recommend you to use Word Power Made easy by Norman Lewis, which has application and roots of many words which will not only help you in your CAT but also in GRE GMAT and what not. An app called VoLT (Vocabulary Learning Technique) is also there which is really helpful as it has pictorial representation of words and really large word list for that matter . Do check it out I found it very helpful.Follow the lead given up here and you be just fine, again all I can comment upon is based on what an average person and candidate would prepare for. Maybe you have a very good base of Maths have been speaking English for the most part of your life, then its a complete different scenario.So keep calm and prepare, No need to be scared. Trust on yourself that YES, you have prepared the best way possible and you will be just fine.","No.Cracking CAT is not tough. CAT is an aptitude test. You need to be in high spirits built with good practice. That is the key.Lots of people take the CAT prep too hard on themselves, this ain’t fair. Reason: CAT is an aptitude exam, you can do awesome on your day! It is not a syllabus coverage based exam. It is about solving the questions you know well -an exam of calm mind - selection of easy to moderate questions and solving them!But, the other side is also not cool - you should not just do nothing or do bits and pieces.What I advice my students is to practice hard till a month before CAT and then relax a month before CAT - only do basic revision and give a few mocks. Keep your calm in the final month. Aptitude, once built, stays for long. So practice and then relax and enter CAT.Load nahi lene ka guys!Best wishesRahul SirFollow my CAT prep group on: CAT Prep with IIM A alumni"

Number of students in both the slots are almost equal but difficulty level of both the papers are quit different so after exam a scaled score is calculated to balance this difficulty level.Raw score and scaled score have more difference when paper conducts in more slots but now the days paper conducts in two slots only so there is no big difference in raw score and scaled score. This difference is negligible for scores above 80%ile.Note- So I assume your raw score and scale score is same that is 147.PercentilePercentile is calculated on the basis of your position with respect to other aspirants. Suppose you got 9th rank in CAT exam and total CAT aspirants are 2 lac. This means that 199,990 people scored less than you. Your percentile would be (199990/200000)*100 = 99.995%ile.Note- A scaled score of 147 marks in CAT 2017 would mean an overall 96.45 percentile.

It varies year to year depending on the difficulty level of the exam.Scaling is done according to the difficulty level of the questions. In the Easier questions marks can be scaled down while in the difficult questions marks can be scaled up. Questions most attempted by the students will get less weightage than the lesser attempted ones. This way through both the slots parity is done so as to do justice to all the students.If many candidates find VARC easy then percentile will be low like in CAT 2017 quant was relatively easier so the number of questions required to be attempted was high for a good percentile.You just focus the best way you can attempt more questions keeping in mind accuracy.Don't go to the examination centre with a fixed mindset of solving certain number of questions.

CAT Exam,How can I prepare for the CAT 2019?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-prepare-for-the-CAT-2019,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",13,"Well, it is a very commonly asked question by most aspirants. Before answering this question I would like to applaud you. Since, you have planned to write CAT in 2019 and start thinking and making plans right from now to crack it. Though 7-8 is an ideal time to prepare for CAT. But you have about 28 months from now, you can do it very very efficiently. You can be at the par level of some of the best CAT trainers in India. Yes no mocking, seriously you can be at par!Considering the fact that IIM can’t change the sections at which they test the students, you have to prepare for four sections. Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation (DI), Logical Reasoning (LR), Quantitative Aptitude (QA).Since you have 28 months of time from now, you can explore and learn plenty of it. Starting from VARC section, start learning 4 words from today daily upto 25 months. Yes you don’t need to learn more than 4 words. They are enough for the day. So total words you can learn in 25 months period is 25*30*4=3000 words!!! Taking the assumption of 30 days a month. Phew!!! They are more than enough to decode the tough RC’s, whatever level of it could be. Do 1 reading (article or editorial from newspaper, I would suggest to read The Hindu) a day. You will complete about 750 readings and these will cover various topics like Philosophy, History, Finance, Politics, Psychology, Science and Technology, History, Current affairs, International News, etc. This will help you to understand the main idea of the passage and you will also learn about the various writing styles of authors. This will act as the main factor in decoding RC’s. Also, apart from readings solve 1 RC a day. And the rest remains Verbal Ability. Paragraph Jumbles, Summary of the passage, Critical Reasoning, Odd sentence out, Fill in the blanks, Last line of the paragraph, Facts Inference and Judgement, Paragraph Completion etc are some frequent topics that are tested in recent years. You can solve plenty of questions and will have enough grip on them. This is all about the VARC section.2) DI-LRNow coming to DI-LR part, which is the toughest section in the paper and the test takers give up while solving the sets. The best way is to crack this section is to start practicing solve from level 1 or even level 0 questions. Make up your speed and solve with 100% accuracy. Caution: Don’t look at the previous CAT question in the start of your preparation if you are not good at it initially. Seriously you lose hope and give up and keep this in mind that scoring 50% of marks in this section will surely fetch you 99+ percentile or even 99.5+ Because questions are lengthy and bit tough it it difficult for the students to solve the all the questions in the given time frame. That is the main reason why low scores will fetch you higher percentile.2a) DISo in Data Interpretation mainly question on Tables, Column Graphs, Pie Charts, Bar Graphs, Frequency Graph, Line Charts, Venn Diagrams, Caselets and various combinations of these are asked. This section is calculation intensive and you have to work on mental calculation to increase your speed to give an edge over others. Learn Vedic Maths, Approximation techniques, Percentage calculation, Certain common fractions, Squares and Cubes of numbers to make your calculation faster. If you are slow in calculation then you will take up huge time to come at the final answer. So start focusing on calculations right from now and you will see that your speed will increase drastically. But you must have patience to arrive at the results.2b) LRIn Logical Reasoning, questions from Linear arrangements, Circular Arrangements, Arrangements based on Rankings, Games and Tournaments, Venn Diagrams, Cubes and Cuboids, Network Diagrams, Quantitative Reasoning mainly are asked. Other topics like Syllogism, Blood Relations, Binary Logic, Logic Connectives , Clocks and Calenders, Number and Alphabetic Series are also asked in other MBA exams but they are usually not asked in CAT. Though you should have a fair ideas of these topics too. You can solve 1 DI and 1 LR set a day and at later stage you can solve 2 sets from each topic in a day as well. They will be enough for you to come across at different models of the question.3) QANow coming to the final section that is Quantitative Aptitude. If you will look at any book you will see that this section has a vast syllabus. But it is not true, This section test you in mathematical topics that you have studied in class 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th. No Calculus, 3D geometry, Conic sections, Trigonometry in it, which makes this section easier if you compare it with JEE levelTopics from which the questions asked are Number Systems, Progressions, Algebra, Percentages, Profit and Loss, Time and Work, Ratio Proportion and Variations, Time and Work, Races, Inequalities, Logarithms, Quadratic Equations, Boats and Streams, Speed Time Distance, Mixtures and Alligations, Simple Interest and Compound Interest, Functions, Geometry and Mensuration, Permutations and Combinations, Probability and Set Theory. These are approximately 20 topics and you can definitely give an average of one month to each. Solve 10–15 questions a day, means you will be solving about 400 questions in a particular topic. That is a huge number and one can stop you in doing that. You will be the master if you are solving 400 questions from a particular topic. Divide 10 days each in solving question of Level 1,2,3 difficulty.All the plans that I have discussed till now will not take more than 90 minutes a day (30 minutes for each section) and most importantly without the load of any time pressure beacause you have plenty of days from today. And 90 minutes a day to prepare for the national level exam like CAT is quite manageable and you can work out without finding any excuses. I am sure enough if you will work accordingly you will get 99.5+ percentile. No ifs and buts in it.Now the question arises from where to prepare from?I would suggest you to start doing preparation from you own side and skim through all topics. After a year you can join any coaching institute in India. Classroom Program will be the best. All coaching institutes are almostsame when it comes to study material, the only difference comes in the quality of trainers. If any coaching pays a high salary then you can assume that trainers will be well experienced. And fees of all coaching institutes is more or less the same. you will not find the difference of more than 5k.First of all, you purchase Arun Sharma Books. It will help you in building the base. I am mentioning the complete name of book and publication for your reference here.How to Prepare for Quantitative Aptitude for the CAT by Arun Sharma, 7th edition, Mc Graw Hill Publications.How to Prepare for Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension for CAT by Arun Sharma Meenakshi Upadhyay, 7th edition, Mc Graw Hill PublicationsHow to Prepare for Logical Reasoning for CAT by Arun Sharma, 4th edition, Mc Graw Hill PublicationsHow to Prepare for Data Interpretation for CAT by Arun Sharma, 4th edition, Mc Graw Hill Publications.I hope I have answered it clearly and all the best for your preparation!!Cheers!!","Thank you for asking.Answer might be bit long but it will be helpful for you. So use smartphone feature name scrolling and keep reading :pSo CAT 2019 is after 14 month and you still have enough amount of time to prepare for it.First CAT is divided into three parts namely Verbal ability, Logical reasoning and Quantitative aptitude.So lets talk about how to prepare for CAT 19 each section wise.*Verbal Ability*1.Start reading newspaper not only with the point of reading or increasing your verbal marks but also with the aim of increasing your General knowledge power and current affairs. By reading news paper you are doing those two things together. But reading newspaper wont be sufficient as it does not contain any questions and you might understand something but there are chance you might miss out something that author wants to tell shile reading article. So apart from this,i would suggest you to solve RC..Solve RC not from books but from Online platform,as most of the exams are Online exams and there is huge difference when you give same exam with pen paper rather Online. So practice from online material. For that i would suggest you to join iquanta facebook group CAT Preparation - iQuanta where you will find atleast 5–6 RC daily posted by other aspirants and try to solve them. Apart from this there are website like rcprep or you can find RC100 pdf online. Start solving rc from there. As out of 34 questions,24 questions are of RC and 2–3 are of para summary which is also somewhere small RC. so i would suggest you to focus on RC the most.If you are good with parajumbles then would suggest you to do it else just skip it like i always do.*DI*This one is one of the stressful section for students fron last couple of years. Not only because it is tough but it also checks how quick your senses are and how you are in selecting the sets.There will be couple of sets,which even they know that it is close to impossible for student to complete in the speed base exam like CAT and if you trap yourself in such sets,you might end up with disaster.So the best thing to score in LR-DI is to practice more questions on daily basis so you understand which sets you shoukd leave and before attempting the sets what are the things you should look for.Here i would suggest you to join iquanta facebook groupCAT Preparation - iQuanta where you will find one event dedicated to LR-DI, where daily 3–4 sets are being posted with its solution. Try it on daily basis without time limit at this point and you will be good to go.*Quant*This section is one of the most scoring section for student and you too should try to get maximum mark in this section.Try to clear you basics about each topic before attempting mocks or sectional. would recommend you to Join which is India's largest online prepartion group for CAT. CAT Preparation - iQuanta with more than 2.7 lakh people in it. You will find 400–500 doubts on daily basis posted by fellow aspirants and other aspirants are trying to solve it with different approaches and thats where the peer learning starts and which is very helpful.Stay in that group for couple of month and try to solve the questions and once they start their batch for CAT-19 student in January,you can join them too.Best thing about this group and there course is that they provide several shortcuts with method and in speed base exams,Short cuts are very handy.If you just want to see some of their short cuts you can visit (website link),you will find several quant short cuts in faculty gyan section,i was actually amazed by those shortcuts as those were never taught to us in any other classes and thats the reason iquanta is having maximum number of 99%ilers in CAT. You can check it from CAT Preparation online - IQuantaIn case of any doubt regarding iquanta course you can get in touch with them on i hope it is helpful for you and best of luck for your prepration :)","If you have decided upon preparing for CAT 2019, then the first and theforemost thing is to understand the dynamics of this exam. It is a 3 hourscomputer based exam which is going to test your aptitude and language skillsand eventually will decide your future as to which B school you will pursueyour MBA from. If you really aspire to go into an elite Business School, thenmake up your mind that you need to score a very good percentile which is not acakewalk. Slogging for hours will not do the job. There has to be meticulousplanning and optimization of resources. There are three sections in this exam-Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VaRC), Data Interpretation andLogical Reasoning (DILR) and Quantitative Aptitude (QA).All the threesections require a different skill set and their preparation requires a differentstrategy.VARC checks upon the language skills of the candidate. The different modulesin this section are grammar, reading comprehension, critical reasoning, parajumbles and para completion and odd one out. But, if one considers the mostscoring module, then reading comprehension holds the most prominent position.From the last few years there have been 24 questions (5 passages) out of 34questions coming from this module. The best thing about it is that you don’tneed to have any prior knowledge. Simply one needs to understand the passagesand solve the questions based upon your understanding of the passage. Forsome, reading comes naturally as they have been reading novels andnewspapers since their childhood. So, they won’t face major problems in thismodule. But there are many who may struggle with comprehensions as they arenot in the habit of reading. So, the first step is to start reading a lot onscreen.Read novels, e-books, newspapers, articles to develop the habit of reading.Make a habit of reading The Hindu daily especially the editorial section. Also,start practicing passages from GMAT club. It is an extensive store house ofgood passages. All the passages are time based here, so it will help you inimproving your speed as well. Pick up good novels and when I am saying goodit means novels of prominent authors where you can find enriched language. Itwill help you to improve your grammar, to understand the structure of passagesand more importantly will improve your stamina of reading.DILR- This is the most dreaded section of all the three. Every year the level ofdifficulty has been constantly increasing and it has become a nightmare formany. But this section requires a different strategy to ace. For LogicalReasoning, you need to solve puzzles. Make a habit of solving sudoku on adaily basis. Start solving two to three sets daily. Data Interpretation involvescalculations. So, squares of numbers, their cubes and conversion of percentagesinto their equivalent fractions must be on your finger- tips. Pick up resources topractice and start solving them. Start from the basics and once you have gainedsome confidence, then try to move to the difficult sets. Solve previous years’DILR sets. They are a brilliant resource to build your understanding and clarityof this section. Full length mock tests and the sectional tests will also give you aplethora of good quality sets.QA- This section is the most scoring of all the three and perhaps require most ofyour energies and time to ace it. It has a proper syllabus and you need topractice each and every chapter. The major modules are- Geometry, Arithmetic,Algebra, Number System and Modern Math. It is basically the math that youhave studied till tenth standard. But having said that, the questions are not reallyeasy. For example when you studied geometry in your school, most of us wouldmug up the theorems and their proofs. But here one needs to apply thesetheorems in solving a problem. So, getting an exposure to diverse models and ahell lot of practice will go a long way. Keep in mind that Arithmetic andAlgebra are the two most important modules. So, focus a lot on these twomodules. If mathematics scares you and your basics are shaky, then start withNCERT books to get a feel of the topics and gradually move to harderproblems.Now, there is one important aspect in the preparation. Whether to join aclassroom program or self-study will be enough. In my case I had joinedclassroom program by Kitabee Education Services. I personally feel thatcoaching helps you to trespass the restrictive boundaries set by our minds. Agood coaching guides you during the entire duration of your preparation,motivates you to perform to your optimum and more importantly helps u indesigning strategies other than the knowledge it imparts. It actually streamlinesyour preparation. But, simply a coaching cannot guarantee you results. Youhave to go the extra mile. You need to put in your best efforts to get the desiredpercentile. Also, join a good mock test series.I hope my answer helped u. All the best for your preparation.","You have close to 2 years in time. You don’t have to prepare for the actual exam but you can do a few things which will train you for the basics required for the exam.Mental Calculations - You should practise calculating whatever you come across mentally and not by using pen and paper or calculator. You can use speed maths tests for this.Solve one Data Interpretation set per week: Do the calculations mentally as far as possible. It might take a lot of time initially but eventually you will pick it up.Read newspaper everyday: Preferably The Hindu and editorial column is a must. You will come across many new words. Write them down. Know their meaning. Make sentences from that word. Make a list of synonyms for each word. At the end of the week you will have around 100 words. You should be perfect with those 100 words. If you have more time, read a business paper too.Practise at least one Reading Comprehension per week:RC is the scoring section in verbal. Train yourself to do it right. Maintain an error list to note down where you went wrong. Try to avoid those mistakes next time.Practise one Logic Reasoning question per week:You will know what type of questions you are good at and which part of logic reasoning questions you need to improve.Read books:Read at least 2 books in a month. Note down new words you come across and master them.You can start your actual preparation in mid of 2018.All the best!"
CAT Exam,"Which is better, Career Launcher or IMS in Guwahati?",https://www.quora.com//Which-is-better-Career-Launcher-or-IMS-in-Guwahati,"Career Launcher, CAT Preparation",5,"(7 things to keep on mind before taking admission in bank coaching centre)The banking sector is one of the biggest and fastest growing sectors in India offering many job opportunities all over the country. But, getting a bank job is not so easy, as you must attempt maximum questions at less time by competing thousands of aspirants.However, if you will get the right guidance and knows the trick to solve the problems in just seconds then you can easily get a job in the bank sector. Many students fail to crack the bank examination due to lack of practice and time management, while some successfully cracked the exam with distinction marks as they know the tricks.To know the tricks of solving problems within seconds, you must take admission in the best bank coaching centre. But, before taking an admission in any coaching centre, one must know how to choose the right coaching institute so that you won’t waste your precious one year time.So, here are some questions to ask and reasons behind asking these questions while taking an admission in any bank coaching centre.So, don’t get confused to ask these questions -1. How your coaching centre is better than other centres? What are the achievements?Reason – They will tell you the past achievement stories of their students and it will give you a clear picture of their institute. By knowing the institute’s background, you will be clear about the quality of their education.2. Ask about the batch timings and rescheduling possibilitiesReason – Batch timing is very important for all students because it shouldn’t clash with your other class or work timing. Many students forget to ask about the timings during admission, but one should ask always. You will possibly have some reason and have to miss the class; therefore, it is necessary to ask if they provide classes by rescheduling the time. You never know when such a situation might occur, and you might have to miss your class, so better ask them about rescheduling of classes before taking admission.3. Do they offer trial class before admission?Reason – You should ask for a free demo or trial class before taking admission as it will help you to know the quality of teaching. After taking a trial class, you will get a clear picture of the coaching institute whether to take admission or not.4. What will be the duration of this course?Reason – Never hesitate to ask the course duration before taking admission. By asking this, you can calculate your exam preparation time with revision.5. Will you provide study material, crash courses, mock tests, and other tricks to score well? What is the teaching pattern?Reason – Best banking coaching centres provide revision tests, study material, mock tests, and interactive classes also for all students. So, if you are looking for the best coaching centre for your coming bank examination, then you must make sure whether they are providing all studies material and practical GDs or not. Taking coaching classes means one must get prepared for the competitive exam mentally and physically with proper guidance.6. Faculty member’s experienceReason- By knowing faculty member’s experience, you will get an idea about all teachers and their experience also. You want the best learning, right? So, there is no immorality in asking the experience and qualification of the faculty.7. What’s the fee structure? Any discounts and refund policy for the students?Reason – Bank coaching centres in India have almost similar fee structures, so better compare the fees rate with other institutes as well. Another important thing to keep on mind is the payment option. Some coaching institutes allow making fee payment in installments and also provides an extra discount on advanced payment. So, before taking admission in any institute make the payment process clear and choose the option as per your convenience.(http://www.visionq.co.in/)","CAREER LAUNCHER Guwahati is undoubtedly a centre that doesn't disappoint and best Coaching centre for MBA-CAT/MAT,Govt.jobs-BANK /SSC, and UG Course-CLAT/IPM/BBA. The Center Head himself teaches Quant and DI and is available 24*7 in whatsapp. Other faculties from English and LR are also worth mentioning and from whom i have learned a lot apart from academics. The best part is that you will find students from other reputed coaching institutes repeating their coaching with CL which itself is a proof that its actually good. Needless to mention that their Mock Test Series is amongst the best and Study materials well researched. The fact that the faculties are so approachable is what makes it the best. Faculties won’t shy away from questions being posed to them and are ever ready to help. This becomes even more important if you are that kind of person who is a little introvert. The class environment gives each an equal opportunity for questions being asked.PROS OF JOINING CAREER LAUNCHER1) Top facultiesThe Quant and LR faculty are exceptionally good. English is actually good if you want to learn but it gets a little boring sometime ( my personal experience). CL is probably the only center where attendance for Quant is the highest since most of the concepts are taught by the center head himself. The teaching style at the center is that they take your understanding for that topic to be zero and start from scratch. Slowly the level is increased and advanced ideas are introduced. Even arts students like these sessions and look forward for those classes. The faculty for LR also is a very sincere lady who gets to basics before solving complex puzzles and other LR questions. The sessions are fun to attend and enriching.2) Small batch sizeThe Batch size hovers around 15-25 with a seat capacity of 30. So its not very crowded or intimidating in the classroom and since its an AC classroom, its quite comfy which helps you concentrate on what is being taught rather than the regulator of the fan . The students come from varied background and you will have Engineers Commerce and Arts students discussing together. Classes that are missed by the students are adjusted with some other batch and hence a big relief.3) CL SISThis is at the heart of your preparation. Its like a FB account where you have your own username and password and your own individual account. It has various tool like A) Vocab Ninja ( A word power game that lets you earn coins and benchmark yourself against all the students across India. You get a pretty much idea of where you stand when you see the toppers list in the Topper rankings given and makes you word 10x more. B) All India Mocks – These mocks are designed in such a way that they come closest to a BANK/SSC exam. Also, you analyse your own preparation vs your peers across India .for these mocks, there is an analysis zone with solutions. There are other statistical data too which gives you information like your accuracy and the type ( Easy/ Moderate/ Difficult) of questions you probably missed out on.

Mock tests helped me a lot and their shortcut techniques are really helpful for students. now i can prepare easily for any competitive exams. According to me, Ims Guwahati is the best coaching centre in Guwahati for MBA entrance - CAT/ MAT/ XAT/ SNAP/ IIFT/ GMAT, and for Government exams - BANK EXAMS, SBI PO, IBPS PO exams, IBPS CLERICAL exams, SBI CLERICAL exams, RBI entrance, etc","My experience as a student in IMS Guwahati was good and I will definitely be rank IMS first among banking coaching institutes in Guwahati. This institute provides dynamic classroom training, personalized counselling. The management team is from the IIMs, XLRI and other top B-schools in India. The faculty group consist of mentors from IIM, IIT, XLRI and many more who have trained over 15000 students for competitive exams.

IMS Guwahati will assist you in this regard individually.Mock Tests analysis- This is a very important aspect. You have to identify the problems you face, analyses why you are making the mistakes and then work on it. Mock tests are generally like thermometers, which just give you a measure of where you stand. The analysis sessions by mentors who have taught over 15000 are eye openers.Study Materials- IMS Guwahati provides the best study material for all 3 sections. Plenty to solve and every concept explained well. Also, during the course, we were given additional material like shortcuts, formula sheets, extraordinary previous questions etc. Brilliantly trained faculty consisting of IIMs and many other prestigious B-school’s alumnus and state of the art e-learning modules that help students perform excellently. I have an easy access to online study material.Full time faculty- aids in easy access to the faculty members for doubt clearing sessions.

FACULTY OF IMS - While QA / DI faculty is best at IMS Guwahati. The faculty of Verbal must have trained at least 15000 candidates in terms of experience. DI-LR, VA-RC, BA, MA, GA, CT etc. are the practice-based sections.2. PEDANTIC ADMINSTRATION- I don’t know if this is a problem or this still exist or not, but IMS has a pedantic approach when it comes to rules such as ‘absenteeism from class’. They will call you at home and ask for reasons for not attending class on particular day.Take aways:- If you are dedicated towards your goal and want to get in your dream job any coaching institute will do it for you. As I said earlier your own efforts will count the most, coaching for banking/ ssc-cgl/ rbi/ rrb/ ibps po, ibps clerical, sbi po will just be there to guide you and bring you back from bad phase of preparation or bring you back on path if you have deviated from your goal.I am happy that I decided to join ims guwahati.

If you are interested in Finance, you know where to head. :)Placements. Though as much as I feel that placements should not be a factor to judge B-Schools. However, this is something important to every candidate before they join any B-School. Since, I'm from IIMC, my views would be biased, so I won't comment anything on placements. But this is what Placement Chair at IIMB has to say about placements at IIMC as compare to IIMA >> https://www.quora.com/Are-placements-at-IIM-Calcutta-as-good-as-that-of-IIM-Ahmedabad/answer/Ganesh-N-Prabhu?srid=yczh&share=0b8c2ed3Triple Crowned.

With EQUIS accreditation, IIM Calcutta becomes the first Indian business school to achieve the ‘Triple Crown’ in accreditation, i.e. accredited by all the three major accreditation agencies in the world for management education. Only 5 other business schools in Asia and 73 business schools around the world are currently ‘Triple Accredited’.CEMS MIM Program. The only indian B-School to be a part of it.Crowd.

The campus is one of the most beautiful ones in the country with seven lakes decorating it.And many more, which I will update after exploring. :PUpdates:Eateries.

The advantages are for you to judge. I will also try to answer the concern which one of my friend from IIM community has raised.You dont need my answer to know that IIMC is one of the best places to learn management in the country. Joka surely teaches us business management, but it also allows us the opportunity to learn how to go beyond the books when it comes to being a Leader. And that is what makes this place special.From day 1 we live by the spirit of Leaving No One Behind.! We are proud that we leave no stone unturned to support our batchmates and team-mates when they need our help to defeat the odds. The odds may come in the form of exams, placements or sports. But you ask for it, and there will be more hands to help you than you need.Team Sports are not played only by players, each and every Jokar stands by them to support in Whatever Manner We Can.!!While you pick your school, there are a few things you might want to learn in acads, but there are a lot many which can make you stand out in the industry that you will surely learn at Joka.If you want to learn how to do whatever you can to win, come to Joka.If you want to learn how to make your competition feel demoralized, come to Joka.If you want to learn how to cheer your team mates when they are down, come to Joka.If you want to learn how not to get offended by any comment in the world, come to Joka.Leadership is about keeping your team above you, supporting your mates, and fighting out all odds as and when they arrive. We are proud that we do that. And we will continue to do that.Proud to be a Jokar.!","I had a convert from both IIM-A & IIM-C, and was really confused at that time. My answer is to help those confused souls.So, I had a discussion then, with few of my exceptionally helpful btech seniors, 1 from IIMA, 1 from B and 2 from IIMC. Coincidentally, all 4 said at the end, would suggest pick IIMC.And I will have to accept that this was the best decision for me.As an outsider to IIMA and Alumnus of IIMC, the only difference I could see was the culture of IIMC and the focused approach to acads at IIMA. And I have learnt that the culture that you inculcate is >> the acads that you go through.With this I assume, I have made it little easier for you to decide, where you would want to go when you are stuck while making the tough choice.","As a current student at IIM C. I can tell you about that the culture “GLOBE” should be ignored because the reality of our culture is this :Election of Student Council: Rigged by previous Student council membersElection of Placement representatives: Won’t even call it an electionRoles of Placereps: Maximise opportunities for previous placereps by tiering companies so as to suit them.Role of PGP Reps: Ask professors to change grade cut offs to suit themRole of Hostel Reps: Teach people sledging via an inter hostel competitionRole of Sports Secretary: Promote cheating in competitionsRole of Alumni Secretary (if you are not impeached): Procurement and Distribution of illicit substancesSo in corruption IIM C> IIM A+B, in all other aspects, A is better, although the placement team is equally corrupt over there as well but still better than oursHere are some proofsAnonymous's answer to Is there an impeachment motion against Placement Representatives at IIM Calcutta?
