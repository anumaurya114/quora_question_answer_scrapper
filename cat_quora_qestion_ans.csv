CAT,How was your CAT 2017 result?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-your-CAT-2017-result,"Cat 2017 Results, CAT 2017 Exam Score, CAT (Common Admission Test) 2017, Common Admission Test (CAT)",45,"Going anonymous for personal reason.I have always battled anxiety. India is a strange country. Whenever you have an anxiety attack where you feel that everything is shit and you have lost the battle and there is no hope. People will dismiss your feeling by saying “Nautanki mat karo” (Dont pretend). But deep down you know that when other people are calm and smiling, your heart is racing, your mind is making noises, you are afraid and there is no one to calm you down. You are all alone.Getting back to me, in any exam and sometimes on a regular day, my heart will race. There were times when I will not be able to communicate with the shopkeepers for merely buying things. I was working as well as preparing for CAT, losing focus, gaining focus. In the month of September (two months before CAT) - I even went to psychiatrist for help. He prescribed me some pills. And along with this I was preparing for CAT.I had just one goal. Finish with the exam. If you screw up, you should not blame anyone. You should own whatever blunder or things you would achieve. I took two weeks off from the office and gave everything to it. My percentile were never in my favor. Always lying in the range of 60–80%. The last mock percentile I achieved was 65%. (This was one week before the exam)In all these commotions , I learned one thing. Getting riled up and all worked up will never solve the problem. I would always look at Dhoni and Ronaldo . I learnt calmness from them. Even if the sky is about to break loose, these two will be calm and quiet. They will not worry. I started to do regular Pranayam - so that i can be in the more control of my brain.In early days, when these attack would come, I would be all riled up. I will leave everything . And in some corner of my home - I would overthink myself to death. But this time, I was not going to do these things. I just kept this 65% in one of the corners of my brain and worked on my problems.On the exam day, I had just one goal. Just finish the exam. I had the morning batch and thankfully I was in control of myself. Yes, after seeing DI/LR section - I thought that it is all over. I am shit, I cannot compete in India. But within minutes - I was back in control. And finally I finished the exam with all the best I can give.The result came. And it looked something like thisVA-RC: 99.4, DI/LR: 92.29, QA: 79.83. Overall: 94.9After the result, I was happy. May be this was my destiny. May be if I would have scored more than 80% in QA, IIM would have increased their sectional cutoff to 85%. I cannot predict future.For now I have converted good colleges and will be leaving my job to pursue my MBA.. (Those colleges that don’t consider sectional :p)But in the end, I learned the followingI won from myself. My competition was not from student who were achieving more than 95% in mocks but with me.I didn’t lose hope till the end.And yes, people like me who battle depression and anxiety. I have just one message for you“YOU ARE HELL OF A WARRIOR. YOU BATTLE YOURSELF EVERY SECOND. AND YOU ALWAYS WIN. NEVER COMPARE YOURSELF TO ANYONE. YOU HAVE YOUR OWN BATTLE AND YOU HAVE TO WIN IT”","As I take CAT exam regularly, to understand my performance in CAT17, it would be good to compare with my CAT16 scores. I will put both my scorecards here and will then compare with regards to my learning from the CAT exam.CAT1 7 was an easier exam as compared to CAT16. The last person to score a 100%ile in CAT16 was around 219 whereas in CAT17 was around 229. Purely on overall score, my scores in CAT17 is poorer as compared to CAT16 as in CAT16 I was 30 marks more than the last person who scored 100%ile and in CAT17 this gap reduced to around 16 marks. If you compare the marksheets, you will realise the main reason for the same was the Verbal section.Verbal Section: This has been my Archilles heel for many years right from the time I started to prepare for CAT in my college days. I have done no major preparation for Verbal section over the years and the only reason I score well in Verbal is because I read a lot and some help from my wife. Both in CAT15 and CAT16 I scored a 99.9+ in Verbal. Both those years I ensured that I read a lot during the 3 months before the exam date. One of the years I read the whole Harry Potter Series and in the other year I read Lord of the Rings apart from some other books. But in CAT17 I became a tad overconfident. As I had got 99.9+ in both my previous attempt, I thought it would not be difficult to repeat the feat. Which is why I did not read much before the CAT17 exam, and the result are there in the score card. I lost more than 20 marks in CAT17 in the Verbal section even though the section was supposed to be easier. This just underlines the importance of reading during the months before the exam.DILR: I have scored a 100%ile in both CAT16 and CAT17 in this section thanks to the learning from CAT15 DILR paper. When I wrote the CAT15 paper I did keep a target of solving all questions in this section. But the paper was tougher than what I had predicted and that resulted in a little panic during the exam. I realised that I should not keep targets in the exam as it just builds stress. In both these exams I went with a cool mind and decided to solve as much as I can even if it means just 1 set. This helped me to relax during the CAT17 test and managed to solve 7 sets and did intelligent guess for the 8th set.Maths: My marks in Maths improved, but my percentile was down as CAT17 maths section was easier. Maths is a section where even though I scored well every year and a few 100%iles in this section, I end up having self doubts. The following are the reasons for the same:Every year my students ask me a lot of doubts from different mocks and for a lot of questions I have to say - I dont know, I dont think this will come in the CAT exam as it is beyond what you are supposed to know. - After saying I dont know many times you start wondering whether you really know the CAT exam.To add to this i have completely shunned watching various social media groups where I feel ashamed to say I am a maths teacher after going though the questions that are put up. Half the things just goes above my head.Going through the mocks I also realised that if I solve the mocks I will not be able to do well in the test.Luckily for me I have solved in the exam almost all the questions that have come in the CAT for the last 10+ years. This year too I solved all questions with 3 incorrect, Out of the 3 questions I went wrong, I solved two questions correctly but ended up marking the wrong answer. The last one the method did not click in the exam, though I knew how to solve it. To add to this my students end up doing really well in the exam every year which helps to boost my confidence as a teacher.Learning for Maths section is - dont get too much into formula as CAT does not check you on that. Focus on learning the Maths concepts that are there in your school. Learn to solve easy questions with alternate methods and skip the tough questions. That is the key in the exam, solving the easy ones and leaving the tough ones.My advise: Read a lot. Don’t keep targets, solve how much you can. Learn to leave the tough questions and solve the easy ones.Persevere, even if you feel that CAT is tough. I have seen my students not scoring more than 90%ile in mocks ending up with 99+ in actual CAT. — Darr ke aage Jeet Hai.","This was my 3rd CAT attempt.Background:Gave first attempt during my graduation final year in 2015. Prepared my ass off in 7th semester to witness abysmal score in CAT 15. Just got a meagre 83.*(60.* in VaRc :( )Joined an IT company from college placement. Just for 5 months and left it; I was desperate to crack this time and was totally bitten by MBA bug. Gave full fledged mocks for 2 months only to get bitten by cat once more. This time got a paltry 89.*(VaRc-72). Caveat is got 94 in XAT but as destiny planned I couldn't clear section cutoff in quant.(got 98 in verbal here..lol)Thought of joining some random job but I thought what is the point of doing a job just for the sake of doing. I went full throttle this time, prepared hard, cleared all the basic, and read newspapers, novels,magazines to improve my verbal skills.Gave around 35 mocks this time scoring 85–97 percentiles in IMS,TIME mocks. I was totally confident of acing CAT this time.And the d-day comes:Slot 1:Cruised VARC in 50 mins, attempted-33Totally baffled in DILr and totally messed here, attempted 07(yes, fucking seven)Lost hope of clearing cat by this time.And ,quant it was a breeze and attempted 31.I was expecting a total of 140–150 based on key released by IIM.Result day:After completion of XAT, I was coming to my home town from Bangalore and a friend of mine called and said result is out.My heart started pounding and all the hardwork I did, risk of leaving my job flashed infront of my eyes.I downloaded the admit card and checked my resultOa:89.*Varc:77Dilr:54Quant: 98I was totally started and went numb for an hour. All the negative thoughts popped into my mind and I felt like useless piece of shit. I did all I can still I fumbled on d-day.Lessons learnt:Don't put all your stakes on CAT if you are GEM(general , Engineer, Male)Never leave your job unless you are confirm of scoring 99.5+Don't refrain yourself from all the fun in the name of preparation. CAT is just another exam.Have a backup option. It eases the pressure off.","My experience with CAT!CAT2015: 93%ile impromptu. Converted my only call from IIM-I. Graduated from NIT Dgp with a job in HPCL. Chose the job. Thought better preparation would fetch a better college.CAT2016: 90%ile. No preparation. No calls obviously. Totally lost, as I wasn't really loving my job, though well paying. I didn't see my future there. Thought of resigning but researched for days about pros and cons. Didn't want to settle for an average B-school, and didn't want to stay idle without a job and only with preparation. People said joblessness creates a bad impression on the ability to manage time.Decided to resign by June. Grilled by job. Still tolerated. My loved ones kept me composed and patient. They were my only source of happiness.Started working only to kill time and to make money. Bought Handa Ka Funda online course and went through all the videos. Bought TestFunda test series and took mock tests on off days, very irregularly though. Scored 85–99%ile in mocks in no regular curve. A strong foundation and good academic history was a plus point. Decided not to take risk, and resign only after results.Prepared with a long term motive but without stress. Everytime I felt helpless at job, I realized how important it is for me to make myself more qualified.Treated myself with delicious food everytime I scored well. Kept learning for months. FB feed was filled with questions from CAT group. My speed increased gradually.Took a leave in the CAT17 week, went home for four days, took blessings of my parents, wishes of my brother and close friend, and appeared with a do or die mindset.These 180 minutes of my life will decide quite a lot of things. This was in my mind. I gave my best.Verbal and Quant were flawless. Did not do well in LRDI, the section I always hated. I feared I would not clear the sectional cutoff. But it was difficult for everyone.On January 8, with a lot of expectations, I checked my result. Cleared the LRDI cutoff that I had feared.Scored 98.56%ile. I was happy. Really grateful to God and everyone who supported me.99.91 in verbal, 90.5 in LRDI, 94.5 in Quant.So far, I've calls from IIM L,K,I,SPJ. Expecting to convert any of these and finally settle down for MBA.Fingers crossed! I'll edit this post when I convert one :pMy message to future aspirants:Do not go for MBA just because everyone else is. Do it when you feel the need.You can be successful without an MBA.Set realistic goals. Judge your records, ability. Don't push yourself too much.After judging, decide if you can prepare yourself or need coaching.Be calculative if you want to have a good career and personal life balance. Have long term goals.Think of finance.Don't rely totally on CAT, it is unpredictable. Result is not proportional to skills all the time.If you don't like your job, try your best to continue until you reach the threshold. If you have very strong reasons to quit job, quit. Or else don't. Don't listen to generalized comments or advice.People who love their job and want to settle with it are really lucky!! :D"

I registered for almost all MBA related exams with the money i had made by working odd jobs. MAT came, I still don’t even know the syllabus or anything, tried to do some 20 questions, answered most others with ‘intuition’(apparently, there is no negative marking-i’m not even sure of that now). I marked many and came out without any thinking, then started collecting notes for CAT. I decided i wont spend on any coaching. I studied basics for around 10–15 days and October was here. Then i started receiving mails from several colleges regarding MBA admission. My dumb ass had forgot about MAT results. I got calls from BIMTECH, LIBA, BIMM, ALLIANCE etc, so many except TAPMI and XIME(the only good colleges i knew which accepted MAT). Then i had the inner calling to check MAT score. 95 percentile. I didn’t understand what percentile was. I spend an entire evening googling percentile, composite score, what a good score is etc. Finally it dawned-MAT was cracked. But i was no more interested in MAT.I started studying for CAT. I searched for inspirational videos to motivate me. Few friends did this actually. Then i started getting up at 4 daily, study till 7, breakfast at my study table while i watch a video on quant/Rc or so, then at 8, restart till 11. Then lunch, a good sleep for 2 hours, restart at around 4–5, take a few breaks, then from 6 to 11 including 1 hour break for dinner and stuff. I had hardly 50 days and had to do same effort as people with 6 month effort because I had to reach their effort level since i wasn’t a scholar or something. I stopped going out of room as such, junk food was stored so i can save time instead of going out and buying(too much ik), dark chocolate, almonds, glucose, etc were 1 feet from me, i had it right before studying. I spent every single rupees i had earned by the end of this. I knew this wasn’t good, because I’m not a genius, i needed more time to understand something and most likely needed the steps to understand most questions.For those who say you can crack CAT in 2 months, don’t generalize. There are many like me who aren’t cracking a question right after reading it. It may take 5 reads to understand the meaning alone. We need more time. We are not the typical geniuses you mention who crack in 2 months.I took 11 mocks in total, with maximum mark of 80 and minimum of 19. But i wasn’t bothered about it, i was more about how to attempt them. My RC was my advantage. I got 50–60 in RC alone. So a quick calculation told me i need just 5–6 in LRDI and 10–15 in quant to get a decent score. And guess what? that’s exactly what i scored- 23 correct in VARC, with 3 wrong, 6 correct in LRDI with 2 wrong, 15 correct in quant with 3 wrong. I got calls from baby IIMs, SPJIMR, MDI and even IIM I. And yes I converted 3 of them- MDI, SPJIMR and the IIM i am in now…at Indore XD.P.S- the high accuracy was not because of my hard work- most was narrowing down to 2 options and choosing one hoping it would be right. Ik it’s not a good thing, but i am no Buddha to follow complete righteousness or so.I answered this question because I’m a middle-back bencher, never scored anything worth telling at all. I passed every exam, but never passed even with average marks. So this is a huge achievement for me.","I decided to take CAT in 2016. I already had a work experience of 2.5 years and I realized that this year was my do or die situation. Because, by the time I again appear for the CAT next year, I would already be having a work experience of 4 years which would not provide me the edge anymore. So according to me, this was my first and last shot.Now as you know, when you have your back up against the wall, you become desperate and you do anything. Same was the case with me. I was working and my job profile demanded full attention for 10-11 hours. That left me only with 2-3 hours to study. So I left all the beauties of life and chose a life of a workaholic nerd. I used to return home a 10 pm from office. Within one hour, I hurriedly changed, swallowed food and went to bed by 11-11:30 p.m. I still remember those days when I used to crave for having dinner with my family but had to eat early as I need to wake up early the next day and start preparing for CAT. I woke up around 7 a.m. the next day and started solving problems from all the books and materials that I had gathered. By 10 a.m., I used to wrap up everything and leave for office.If you think I was done for the day, You are deeply mistaken!! I took the full advantage of commuting for 1-1.5 hours (one way). I had installed various apps and I solved the VARC section while going to the office. Luckily, that section did not require pen-paper, so it was easier for me to have a look at that section while travelling to office. While returning from office, I used to go through the daily news so that it would help me in the WAT/PI process.I didn’t leave a single opportunity to study in the office as well. When my team members were busy taking a puff or gossiping over lunch, I used to have my lunch at desk, pouring over online Quant problems.The weekends were even more difficult. While most of my friends and colleagues enjoyed, went on dates and watched movies, I used to either attend coaching classes or lock myself in the room taking mocks. I took 2-3 mocks every weekend and I spent the rest of my week analyzing the mocks. For an entire one year, I seldom went out with friends. Yes, for a few people and occasions I do made an exception, but like I said, they were literally few.Luckily, all these paid off and by god’s grace, I am today a member of the IIM family. Being a working professional, without the dedication that I showed, I would not have been able to reach an IIM today. So my advice to you would be: work hard for just a year. You would be able to reap the benefits for the rest of your life. Believe me, you would not want to miss out on being a part of the IIM family and the huge network of the eminent B-schools. A few movies on the weekends are nothing in front of what the other side of the table has to offer to you. Trust me, if you show dedication, you would not regret it. Ever.Hope this helps.All the best!","This one pic brings back 1000 memories for me and accurately describes my dedication during that period.This is me revising QA on a construction site in North Africa during lunch break (With my helmet in the background).The Story - Location - Oran, Algeria (About 8000 km from India)I was working as a Construction Engineer in Algeria in 2015 when I first decided to write CAT. Now, as some of you might know, the work of an On-Field Construction Engineer is pretty extreme both mentally and physically. For me, it used to be about 12 hours a day, 6 days a week and that too on-the-site itself.I started my preparation on May 21, 2015, totally clueless about CAT. But once I decided to write it, I ensured to give at least 2–3 hours every day. EVERY SINGLE DAY. (Except for a few days before flying back to India to write CAT). Initially, it was so damn difficult as I used to be super-tired after the field work but not for a single day did I not study. I was starting from scratch, and I had to go ALL IN. I had to leave no stone unturned. It really was NOW OR NEVER for me.It was all the more challenging as this was going to be my first CAT attempt and I had no books, notes or any other direct medium to study from. Most of my preparation was through reading articles online, Pagalguy threads, or mock tests. I also had some pretty amazing friends from Pagalguy with whom I used to discuss (Mohit Jain & Ganesh Nagarsekar were also among them).I would study in whatever way I can on my way to/from office (using Mobile/Notebook). During lunch, I would finish eating in 10 mins so that I can use the remaining 50 mins for studying (The above pic is me studying during my lunch break). Any free time I found during the day, be it for 15 mins, I would do something or the other that would help in some way. (Most of the time, using my mobile as I loaded it up with articles, bookmarks, and even mock test papers that I have already written but the analysis was remaining).[I preferred to study on the site instead of the office as the breeze used to be amazing. This pic below shows my under-construction site and the above pic was while I was sitting inside one of these floors. You can see the Mediterranean Sea in the background!]Now that I think about those days, I may as well say that I might have been possessed and was pretty crazy at times!Heck, I wrote a full mock test on my 6-hour long flight from Algiers to Dubai and ended up analyzing it as well! (This was about 14 days before CAT when I was flying back to India)These 6 months & 7 days were the most amazing days of my life as I can confidently say that I gave all I had in me during this period.The result day… well that’s a story for another time :-)never_settle"

You'll be lucky to get a call.I'm one of the GEMs in the list above.Aim for XAT/GMAT/MDI or max FMS via CAT if your acads are bad.I can only imagine how the others in the list must be feeling right now. It hurts because CAT exam have so many tuitions and mock series and what not crap. It's so overhyped that people forget that it's just a filtering criteria(you're just a number on the excel sheet bro) and nobody cares once you get a call(apart from XLRI MDI FMS). I and the others might not have been as good as we could've been,but I'm cent percent sure we didn't do that bad to be waitlisted in 200s or be direct rejects.It's just effort down the drain. I'm not trying to be a spoilsport but just giving you the truth- truth that nobody told me. Truth that these so called experts with 20+ years of experience in the industry don't tell you because they know if they tell you that you have a slim chance of a call even with 99.8+ you'll never join since it'll become too much of a gamble. Greed at its very best. Seriously you guys,the hell?The argument that “if you know that you can't get a call with a high percentile will you stop studying? No right?” Is the shittiest argument I've ever heard. 99.8+ requires efforts and thorough mock analyses,at least for regular people. I'm not one of those brilliant people who study 1 hour a day for 2 months and crack CAT. So yes, I for one probably wouldn't have if I knew I needed 99.95 for an Ahmedabad call and that even a 100 wouldn't have gotten me a Bangalore call. I would've used my energy and time somewhere else productively.TL;DR NO.I wish I could see recordings of converts and rejects and compare. Feel like absolute crap.Rant over.PS: Funny story- 93%ile SC-E-M - Converted ABC. Go figure.","No.We Indian students are a terribly hardworking breed. Once put our minds to anything, it doesn’t stand a chance. Look at the ever increasing scores in all exams across the world. All conquered. So when someone starts to feel bugged by their engineering coursework(majority aspirants) and having a knack for cracking exams, they get to know about CAT. Another MCQ based paper that delights the best of us given its nature and the level it is tested on. True feline.You enroll, prepare, appear, ace and end up with a number. That number is just to get a call. It does not even appear in the interview application form(so the panel does not know if you are a 100%iler or a 98-only in ABC). Also, you can’t write it in your CV once inside IIM.What remains? Interview, Written Test(called WAT/AWT) and maybe GD. So CAT isn’t the actual D-Day, your interview day is.People say that there is some weightage for CAT as well in the final selection. It’s usually 30%. Without even normalising(as some institutes might do and which you must know reduces the difference of scores further), let’s just say they divide your CAT score by 10. So if you got 220/300 in CAT, you get 22/30 in final composite score. Makes sense?Look at the other side of the picture now.220 was 99.98%ile this year.100% was 230+99% was ~17299.6% was ~185(close to AC cutoffs)Now calculate their weightage individually.100%ile→23+/30(Mind you, only 20 people across the country, highest being 27.5)99.98%ile→22/3099.6%ile→18.5/3099%ile→17.2/30See what the difference between a 100 and a 99(a difference of 2000 ranks btw) amounts to in the final score? Barely 6 marks. Reduces to 4 if you are 99.95.Point being-CAT does not guarantee anything. In the anonymous answer below, I personally know many people in that list being one myself.I was curious as to why such high CAT score couldn’t fetch a IIM-B call. Here’s what the RTI says.Note the weightages for each component:CAT-40, X-20, XII-10, UG-20, Workex-8, Diversity-2My scores:X-94.43(661/700)[ICSE], XII-93.6(468/500)[ISC], UG-70.4%, CAT-99.98(219.81/300), Workex-0So it’s not that you need to have “poor” acads to not even get a call. I was the district topper in 10/12 and an average(not poor) lad in UG. But no call still. Learn this-they seek impeccable, not good. Outliers do exist though.This answer is absolutely not intended to demotivate anyone. I knew about these facts from the start and yet gave it a shot. But many people remain oblivious of the reality. It’s better to know the consequences before building castles in your mind. Some motivation? For same number of people getting rejected, there are a few getting selected as well. But then there are those courageous souls who, even after getting 99.9+ retake CAT multiple times to get in just ABC(in a few cases, just A). So it all depends on your risk taking ability. Just keep a fair idea of where you might land up. I for one always knew about no B call. And was comfortable joining any of ABCLKI(though later mind started to think about retaking CAT). But then realised that having made through once doesn’t mean I could get a call always(tremendous luck needed). So accepted my place in the normal distribution curve.Goodluck!","The answer to this question is no. The most important thing to get an admission in a B-school is how much do you score in CAT, and not how much did you prepare.Even if you crack the CAT, your admission would depend a lot upon the college which you seek an admission into.For a lot if colleges, yes, you can get an admission as soon as you have crossed a particular percentile score in CAT (assuming that you have applied/will apply for that institute) and have higher percentile than the cut-off for the institute for that year.For most (almost all) of the tier-1 B-schools in India, the answer to, if you will get an admission even if you have a high CAT percentile, is “NO” . In fact, cracking the CAT is just half the journey covered.Most of the top B-schools, give individuals calls for the further rounds based on their past academic scores, work-experience and CAT score (gender and academic diversity play a role in getting calls too). Once one has received a call, s/he has to undergo one or more of the following process rounds:WAT (Written Ability Test),GD ( Group Discussions), andPersonal InterviewThe weightage allotted to these rounds for most of the top B-schools is very high. For some institutes it is as high as the CAT score and in some cases even more than the CAT score. Hence, performing equally well in all of these rounds is as important as performing well in the CAT. A final composite score is then calculated separately for every individual and based on the occupancy of the college for that year, final admission are given.To learn more about the WAT, GD and PI rounds conducted across institutes and how to excel at them, I recommend you to watch the video linked. CAT WAT, GD, PI video.Hope this helps.All the best.","Thanks for the A2A Rounak.It depends on the company you are sitting for. Ideally for mass recruiters like CTS, TCS, Infosys etc,CAT prep is more than enough. Generally you can get through the apti round pretty easy, the problem is with the technical interview.So in case you have a good enough preparation for CAT, don't think about the Aptitude round and rather concentrate on the coding skills.:)"
CAT,"Even after 92 percentile in my first CAT attempt, I failed to convert any good colleges. What could I do to avoid this fiasco the next year?",https://www.quora.com//Even-after-92-percentile-in-my-first-CAT-attempt-I-failed-to-convert-any-good-colleges-What-could-I-do-to-avoid-this-fiasco-the-next-year,"Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",6,"For converting any of the top 10 colleges the safest percentile is 99+. You may convert it at less but the safest is 99+.Now coming to my experience, I started preparing for CAT in 3rd year of my engineering, but I was never serious so I ended up missing a lot of classes and was very irregular. Ended up scoring less. Decided to give CAT another attempt and this time promised myself to be serious about it.After my engineering, I didn't take up a corporate job (had an offer). Instead I started working with my father in our family business and was preparing for CAT alongside.I will share my daily routine with you:I used to go to work at 10am and return by 5pm or 6pm.After that from around 7 or 8 I used to start studying till 1 or 2 am.I used to give one section test of RC consisting 3 RC passages daily. This was mainly because I was weakest in VA-RC. I used to analysed the RCs and then start with QA and DI/LR on alternate days. I am a moody person so used to study chapters based on my mood. On days when I was too tired I used to solve easy chapters.For vocabulary, in the initial firsts month I started doing 1 or 2 sessions of word power made easy by Norman Lewis and completed it.I used to give mocks mainly on weekends. Most of my weekends were spent mainly on giving a mock followed by analysing a mock.My mock analysis would give me all the chapters which I need to study in the coming week.I also followed blogs of CATking CAT Blogs and GP ka funda.You can check this study plan : CAT Study Plan It is very comprehensive and nice.You can also follow this youtube channel for more tips :Rahul CATKing Youtube ChannelLastly, I would say consistency is must!This all worked for me. Hope you benefit from some of it too!","Thanks for A2A!As you must have realised by now scoring high in CAT does not guarantee a seat in good B-schools. There are 2 things you can do now to increase your chances of getting selected:1.Improve your CAT score to score more in that component of the selection criteriaThis can be done as follows:Preparing in a structured way is what is required! I used the following approach in my prep days which worked wonders for me:Give 3–4 mocks in a proper timed mannerAnalyse all of them togetherSo analyse all the VA sections together, QA sections together and DILR sections togetherTry to see where you are continuously going wrong or missing out in each of the sectionsThose are your weak areas! Work on them in the following way:Go to the concept files/lessons, learn the conceptLearn how to apply themPractise, Practise and Practise until you have covered all the varieties of questions and are confident about the topic2–3 weeks should be good enough for each of the topics if you give 1/2 hour - 1 hour of time to these weak areas a day for each of the sectionsPost you are done with the weaknesses you can start off with your strengths - only they will take you lesser time and effortLater on post 3–4 months you should be over topic wise preps and can start off with mocks which will further solidify your confidence. However, if you do miss out on any question due to not being able to apply the concept you should go back and go through it again!2. Improve your overall profileDoing online courses pertaining to your interest areasFocus on your job - Be informed about what, why and how you are doing the work you are doing!Join an NGOReading about your interest areas - happenings, key trends, practises, etc.Research on which domain do you want to pursueBeing up-to-date with what is happening in the worldAll this will help you get ready for the GDPI processes of various B-schools and will help you ace them!You can have a look at the following online courses which are exhaustive in terms of coverage, provides flexibility and includes mentorship:CAT 2018 CourseCAT 2018 Mock Series","Thanks for A2A RohitHi students!I remember a BE senior of mine could not convert any IIM after getting approx 99.7 in CAT long back in 2007. Perhaps he did not have the right confidence and frame of mind going into the BLACKI PI rooms. Last year a student of mine could not convert any IIM despite scoring 98.5+ in CAT. So, first thing first - it happens. Now, the reason behind this is lack of the right mentorship or exposure. Understand exposure and guidance come to those who seek. So, here goes my suggestion for next year:Try scoring >92 in CAT. 92 is a very tricky score for the range of colleges that call at that score. IMI, IMT, IRMA,MDI etc. etc. all get most students in the range 88–95. To be on the safer side, try getting 95+. That makes things easier for you.Now, coming to the profile part. Make sure your resume looks a clear picture of who you are. Create buckets of whatever achievements you have got till now. Note down the positions of responsibilities that you have held till now. Prepare your projects and subjects well and go into the PI round as an informed and sorted individual who knows all that he has done in life till now.Be clear on why do you want your hand to fit in the glove. Lots of students miss the bus because they are not able to link their profile to the college and or stream that they are applying for. Read blogs, sites related to management and build a clear perspective on why MBA and why you think you are good for pursuing MBA? CAT score is not the answer for this - interest in exam itself is also not enough - interest in management has to developed. Your MBA personality has to be nourished right from now. So read, follow and enjoy management stuff in life right from now. Believe that you belong!Believe in yourself. Last time was an experience, this time will be performance! Bounce back with 100% confidence. You will do it then.Best wishesRahul SirCAT Prep with IIM A alumni","To be honest it is not all that surprising that one isn’t able to convert a decent B-school through CAT at 92 percentile.To get calls from the older IIMs (ABCLIK) a percentile around/above 99.xx along with having a strong academic history is required. For the 2nd generation IIMs, a percentile above 97 percentile with decent profile shall fetch you calls. For 3rd gen. IIMs (baby IIMs), with a good overall profile you may get calls if you are anywhere above 95 percentile in CAT.So, what can you do to avoid this fiasco?Well, a lot. Start with preparing a study plan for yourself and follow it religiously. Initially brush up on all the basic concepts before moving on to the sectional or full course MockCATs. If you think you are in need of external help, join a coaching institute as soon as possible.Once you are done with the basics, you may take sectional or topic based tests. As you get accustomed to these sectional tests, move towards full course mock CATs. Analyze the results of these mock CATs in depth, to identify your strengths and weaknesses to work on them.Start reading novels, newspaper editorials and business magazines to improve on your vocabulary and reading skills.As most B-schools also give certain amount of weightage to your profile including academic history and work-ex you might want to try and get a job. Having work-ex on your CV will not only provide you the additional points which are allotted for work-ex but will also give you topics and experiences from job to discuss with the interviewer.You might also find this answer of mine helpful: Siddharth Ganthade's answer to What should be my daily routine if I want to crack the CAT 2018?Hope this helps.All the best."
CAT,Why should one prepare for CAT? ,https://www.quora.com//Why-should-one-prepare-for-CAT,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",13,"Going anonymous, since I don’t want my office colleagues know that I am preparing for CAT.This is my CAT story. I gave CAT 2017 and scored 99.48%ile. Thanks to my General Engineering Male status didn’t get a call from ABCLI. Also , I could not convert my IIM-Kozhikode and FMS calls. Am I dejected? Hell yeah. Will I try again? Hell Yeah.I am giving CAT ’18 full aware that I need 99.98%ile at least, to get a call from IIM-A due to my low graduation scores. I know for the fact, that I might not get a call from IIM-B even after scoring 100%ile.At this point I want to say that I work in a reputed product company with a handsome package and a very good work life balance.So what drives me to work even hard to prepare for this exam. Plenty of reasons actually.An MBA from an IIM opens up a whole new window of opportunities ranging from Strategy Consulting to Investment Banking to Marketing. This is a big break away for me from moving from 1 technology stack to another. An MBA thereby opens up a lot of industry verticals.The 2 years of management education instills in an individual the rigour, versatility and persistence to survive in the management world. The most important take away we get from the top IIMs is time management. Loads of assignments with inflexible deadlines forces an individual to prioritize and manage time.2 years of corporate experience has made me aware of the importance of networking. Imagine being in a group of 400 top minds across the country, from different background and different experience level. This combined with the fact that the best management teachers would be teaching you. This makes striving to get into an IIM worthwhile.How do I know all this. online student experiences and interaction with my friends who are in IIM has helped me understand the importance of the top IIMs.Hope to make the cut in CAT 2018. :)Any suggestions are welcomeEDIT: Thanks for your comments. Sorry, could not reply earlier. Got busy in some other things.Some of you wanted to know my acads: 10th - 92%, 12th - 81.5% and BTech: 73%Kushagra Sahai : If you are in your 2nd year, the most valuable thing that you can do is improve upon you academics. It carries a lot of weight when IIMs roll out the calls.Pranav Ingale I would not say that they are not good. But to leave a high paying product company for new IIMs could not be justified.Logging off quora until CAT 2018. Hope I can remove my anonymity after CAT ’18 ;)","That is how life is.I scored a 100 %ile in 2010, and yet did not get a call from IIM-Indore. Upon inquiring, they told me that as per their criteria, I did not make it to the top 1600 candidates who were selected for interviews.I have 90+ in both 10th and 12th, and a 7+ GPA. Nothing stellar, but nothing really bad too. Moral of the story: The shortlisting and selection criteria isn't that straightforward.It is common sense that someone would look at and evaluate the eligibility criteria for interviews before even preparing. It might so happen that some institute has some criteria that you already don't satisfy. All of the same are available on the institute websites.This is precisely why I advise folks to not quit their jobs to prepare for CAT or have a backup career plan (for freshers). P.S. Below are the links for the eligibility and selection criteria for the 19 IIMs. They are updated every year for the next year's process. Any prospective CAT aspirant must ensure that they go through the eligibility criteria for that year, and satisfy at least some of them.The first 7Admission Details - IIMA Indian Institute of Management Bangalore Admissions | IIMC Eligibility : : IIML Announcement - IIMK Academic Programmes - भारतीय प्रबंध संस्थान इंदौर - IIM Indore Post-Graduate Programme (PGP) Admissions at IIM Shillong The next 6 (started on or after 2010)IIM Rohtak "" AdmissionIIM Ranchi - PGDM 2016 (Criteria) IIM Raipur IIM Trichy - PGPM Admission Criteria IIM Udaipur - Post Graduate Programme | Programs | Home IIM Kashipur The final 6 (started in 2015)IIM NAGPUR IIM BodhgayaIIM-Visakhapatnam IIM Amritsar IIM Sirmaur IIM Sambalpur - भारतीय प्रबंध संस्थान इंदौर - IIM Indore","Before we start talking abut the %iles, preparation strategies & all the stuff, let's start by the paper itself!Common Admission Test (CAT)Computer Based TestTime: 180mins (60mins each for all 3 sections)Questions: 100(VA-34; LRDI-32; QA-34)Sections: Verbal & Reading Comprehension (VRC); Logical Reasoning & Data Interpretation (LRDI); Quantitative Ability (QA)All specific details as per CAT 2015 & are subject to change in future!## In general exam is conducted in the last week of November, on yearly basis!PREPARATIONWell, that depends on how you want to tackle it!Either you can enroll yourself to any classroom program or you can do self study & join any online mock series next year.In case you tag plan to along second choice, this is what you can do:Enroll to Career Launcher  & Takshzila shikshak  on YouTube!If you can devote yourself to a classroom program later on, I'll suggest you to join Career Launcher, as the mentors there will work there ass off to assist & facilitate you.Meanwhile buy any good relevant topics related books (Arun Sharma for Verbal, Quant & LRDI) n target 1 topic each every day!Also as you plan to start your prep form Feb-March, these are few things that can help you:Read a loads of good book from different areas/genres.

This will give a good insight of what happened with those who appeared in earlier years.I hope you'll be able to get most out of your preparation.All the best!","The answer is quite Simple. Another question: Why MBA?If you are anywhere close to completing your graduation or have worked in the industry for a few years and are thinking what to do next then MBA from one of the top B-schools in India would definitely have crossed your mind. So, let us cut the chase and come straight to the point. We will talk about 5 reasons why you should do an MBA and 5 reasons why people tend to be afraid of preparing for an MBA:MBA for financial Independence:We hear about the Rs. 1 crore plus salary packages that students from the IIMs get every year. Even beyond those, one can expect a package of 10-20 lakhs post an MBA from one of the top-25 B-schools in India. And mind you, these numbers are for a fresh out of B-school graduate. With a few years of work-experience the salary levels would only go higher. So, for even an average engineering graduate, MBA offers at least a 3 fold jump over his pre-MBA salary levels.MBA for growth in Career:Those of us who have worked for a few years will agree that to grow beyond a certain level in your job, you need an additional degree. Also, even as a fresh graduate you can reasonably expect a saving of 2-3 years in reaching the project manager level of profiles.MBA for greater Job options:The sheer diversity of jobs, the extent of responsibility and ownership that you get as an MBA in your job make it worth your while. You get to choose from a range of specialisations such as Marketing, Advertising, Finance, Strategy, Consulting etc. The challenges that you have as an MBA are much higher and so are the rewards for success.MBA for Job Security:If you recall the slew of recessions that have hit our country over the past 10 years and how vulnerable every job becomes, it'd help to also remember that your job as an MBA is one of the safest ones as the senior resources are relatively difficult to hire and fire.MBA for Social respect, Networking and Credibility:If you want to become an entrepreneur you will need experience in the sector of preference, and financial backing besides others. Your ability to get seed capital for starting a new business improves tremendously if you have done an MBA from one of the top B-schools in the country. You also get to interact with the best minds in the country where you can brainstorm your ideas and get a better handle on things.Ask yourself, who'd you like to be – one-in-a-hundred graduates working for a company or the one who is overseeing their performance. Let is be said that an MBA definitely provides better recognition, opportunities to network and credibility too.And if you want to do MBA from reputed institute then you will have to prepare for CAT as most of these colleges do consider CAT. Even if you don’t want to apply to IIMs then also you may have to appear for an institute specific exam and it will require a CAT level preparation."
CAT,How was your CAT 2017 result?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-your-CAT-2017-result,"Cat 2017 Results, CAT 2017 Exam Score, CAT (Common Admission Test) 2017, Common Admission Test (CAT)",45,"Going anonymous for personal reason.I have always battled anxiety. India is a strange country. Whenever you have an anxiety attack where you feel that everything is shit and you have lost the battle and there is no hope. People will dismiss your feeling by saying “Nautanki mat karo” (Dont pretend). But deep down you know that when other people are calm and smiling, your heart is racing, your mind is making noises, you are afraid and there is no one to calm you down. You are all alone.Getting back to me, in any exam and sometimes on a regular day, my heart will race. There were times when I will not be able to communicate with the shopkeepers for merely buying things. I was working as well as preparing for CAT, losing focus, gaining focus. In the month of September (two months before CAT) - I even went to psychiatrist for help. He prescribed me some pills. And along with this I was preparing for CAT.I had just one goal. Finish with the exam. If you screw up, you should not blame anyone. You should own whatever blunder or things you would achieve. I took two weeks off from the office and gave everything to it. My percentile were never in my favor. Always lying in the range of 60–80%. The last mock percentile I achieved was 65%. (This was one week before the exam)In all these commotions , I learned one thing. Getting riled up and all worked up will never solve the problem. I would always look at Dhoni and Ronaldo . I learnt calmness from them. Even if the sky is about to break loose, these two will be calm and quiet. They will not worry. I started to do regular Pranayam - so that i can be in the more control of my brain.In early days, when these attack would come, I would be all riled up. I will leave everything . And in some corner of my home - I would overthink myself to death. But this time, I was not going to do these things. I just kept this 65% in one of the corners of my brain and worked on my problems.On the exam day, I had just one goal. Just finish the exam. I had the morning batch and thankfully I was in control of myself. Yes, after seeing DI/LR section - I thought that it is all over. I am shit, I cannot compete in India. But within minutes - I was back in control. And finally I finished the exam with all the best I can give.The result came. And it looked something like thisVA-RC: 99.4, DI/LR: 92.29, QA: 79.83. Overall: 94.9After the result, I was happy. May be this was my destiny. May be if I would have scored more than 80% in QA, IIM would have increased their sectional cutoff to 85%. I cannot predict future.For now I have converted good colleges and will be leaving my job to pursue my MBA.. (Those colleges that don’t consider sectional :p)But in the end, I learned the followingI won from myself. My competition was not from student who were achieving more than 95% in mocks but with me.I didn’t lose hope till the end.And yes, people like me who battle depression and anxiety. I have just one message for you“YOU ARE HELL OF A WARRIOR. YOU BATTLE YOURSELF EVERY SECOND. AND YOU ALWAYS WIN. NEVER COMPARE YOURSELF TO ANYONE. YOU HAVE YOUR OWN BATTLE AND YOU HAVE TO WIN IT”","As I take CAT exam regularly, to understand my performance in CAT17, it would be good to compare with my CAT16 scores. I will put both my scorecards here and will then compare with regards to my learning from the CAT exam.CAT1 7 was an easier exam as compared to CAT16. The last person to score a 100%ile in CAT16 was around 219 whereas in CAT17 was around 229. Purely on overall score, my scores in CAT17 is poorer as compared to CAT16 as in CAT16 I was 30 marks more than the last person who scored 100%ile and in CAT17 this gap reduced to around 16 marks. If you compare the marksheets, you will realise the main reason for the same was the Verbal section.Verbal Section: This has been my Archilles heel for many years right from the time I started to prepare for CAT in my college days. I have done no major preparation for Verbal section over the years and the only reason I score well in Verbal is because I read a lot and some help from my wife. Both in CAT15 and CAT16 I scored a 99.9+ in Verbal. Both those years I ensured that I read a lot during the 3 months before the exam date. One of the years I read the whole Harry Potter Series and in the other year I read Lord of the Rings apart from some other books. But in CAT17 I became a tad overconfident. As I had got 99.9+ in both my previous attempt, I thought it would not be difficult to repeat the feat. Which is why I did not read much before the CAT17 exam, and the result are there in the score card. I lost more than 20 marks in CAT17 in the Verbal section even though the section was supposed to be easier. This just underlines the importance of reading during the months before the exam.DILR: I have scored a 100%ile in both CAT16 and CAT17 in this section thanks to the learning from CAT15 DILR paper. When I wrote the CAT15 paper I did keep a target of solving all questions in this section. But the paper was tougher than what I had predicted and that resulted in a little panic during the exam. I realised that I should not keep targets in the exam as it just builds stress. In both these exams I went with a cool mind and decided to solve as much as I can even if it means just 1 set. This helped me to relax during the CAT17 test and managed to solve 7 sets and did intelligent guess for the 8th set.Maths: My marks in Maths improved, but my percentile was down as CAT17 maths section was easier. Maths is a section where even though I scored well every year and a few 100%iles in this section, I end up having self doubts. The following are the reasons for the same:Every year my students ask me a lot of doubts from different mocks and for a lot of questions I have to say - I dont know, I dont think this will come in the CAT exam as it is beyond what you are supposed to know. - After saying I dont know many times you start wondering whether you really know the CAT exam.To add to this i have completely shunned watching various social media groups where I feel ashamed to say I am a maths teacher after going though the questions that are put up. Half the things just goes above my head.Going through the mocks I also realised that if I solve the mocks I will not be able to do well in the test.Luckily for me I have solved in the exam almost all the questions that have come in the CAT for the last 10+ years. This year too I solved all questions with 3 incorrect, Out of the 3 questions I went wrong, I solved two questions correctly but ended up marking the wrong answer. The last one the method did not click in the exam, though I knew how to solve it. To add to this my students end up doing really well in the exam every year which helps to boost my confidence as a teacher.Learning for Maths section is - dont get too much into formula as CAT does not check you on that. Focus on learning the Maths concepts that are there in your school. Learn to solve easy questions with alternate methods and skip the tough questions. That is the key in the exam, solving the easy ones and leaving the tough ones.My advise: Read a lot. Don’t keep targets, solve how much you can. Learn to leave the tough questions and solve the easy ones.Persevere, even if you feel that CAT is tough. I have seen my students not scoring more than 90%ile in mocks ending up with 99+ in actual CAT. — Darr ke aage Jeet Hai.","This was my 3rd CAT attempt.Background:Gave first attempt during my graduation final year in 2015. Prepared my ass off in 7th semester to witness abysmal score in CAT 15. Just got a meagre 83.*(60.* in VaRc :( )Joined an IT company from college placement. Just for 5 months and left it; I was desperate to crack this time and was totally bitten by MBA bug. Gave full fledged mocks for 2 months only to get bitten by cat once more. This time got a paltry 89.*(VaRc-72). Caveat is got 94 in XAT but as destiny planned I couldn't clear section cutoff in quant.(got 98 in verbal here..lol)Thought of joining some random job but I thought what is the point of doing a job just for the sake of doing. I went full throttle this time, prepared hard, cleared all the basic, and read newspapers, novels,magazines to improve my verbal skills.Gave around 35 mocks this time scoring 85–97 percentiles in IMS,TIME mocks. I was totally confident of acing CAT this time.And the d-day comes:Slot 1:Cruised VARC in 50 mins, attempted-33Totally baffled in DILr and totally messed here, attempted 07(yes, fucking seven)Lost hope of clearing cat by this time.And ,quant it was a breeze and attempted 31.I was expecting a total of 140–150 based on key released by IIM.Result day:After completion of XAT, I was coming to my home town from Bangalore and a friend of mine called and said result is out.My heart started pounding and all the hardwork I did, risk of leaving my job flashed infront of my eyes.I downloaded the admit card and checked my resultOa:89.*Varc:77Dilr:54Quant: 98I was totally started and went numb for an hour. All the negative thoughts popped into my mind and I felt like useless piece of shit. I did all I can still I fumbled on d-day.Lessons learnt:Don't put all your stakes on CAT if you are GEM(general , Engineer, Male)Never leave your job unless you are confirm of scoring 99.5+Don't refrain yourself from all the fun in the name of preparation. CAT is just another exam.Have a backup option. It eases the pressure off.","My experience with CAT!CAT2015: 93%ile impromptu. Converted my only call from IIM-I. Graduated from NIT Dgp with a job in HPCL. Chose the job. Thought better preparation would fetch a better college.CAT2016: 90%ile. No preparation. No calls obviously. Totally lost, as I wasn't really loving my job, though well paying. I didn't see my future there. Thought of resigning but researched for days about pros and cons. Didn't want to settle for an average B-school, and didn't want to stay idle without a job and only with preparation. People said joblessness creates a bad impression on the ability to manage time.Decided to resign by June. Grilled by job. Still tolerated. My loved ones kept me composed and patient. They were my only source of happiness.Started working only to kill time and to make money. Bought Handa Ka Funda online course and went through all the videos. Bought TestFunda test series and took mock tests on off days, very irregularly though. Scored 85–99%ile in mocks in no regular curve. A strong foundation and good academic history was a plus point. Decided not to take risk, and resign only after results.Prepared with a long term motive but without stress. Everytime I felt helpless at job, I realized how important it is for me to make myself more qualified.Treated myself with delicious food everytime I scored well. Kept learning for months. FB feed was filled with questions from CAT group. My speed increased gradually.Took a leave in the CAT17 week, went home for four days, took blessings of my parents, wishes of my brother and close friend, and appeared with a do or die mindset.These 180 minutes of my life will decide quite a lot of things. This was in my mind. I gave my best.Verbal and Quant were flawless. Did not do well in LRDI, the section I always hated. I feared I would not clear the sectional cutoff. But it was difficult for everyone.On January 8, with a lot of expectations, I checked my result. Cleared the LRDI cutoff that I had feared.Scored 98.56%ile. I was happy. Really grateful to God and everyone who supported me.99.91 in verbal, 90.5 in LRDI, 94.5 in Quant.So far, I've calls from IIM L,K,I,SPJ. Expecting to convert any of these and finally settle down for MBA.Fingers crossed! I'll edit this post when I convert one :pMy message to future aspirants:Do not go for MBA just because everyone else is. Do it when you feel the need.You can be successful without an MBA.Set realistic goals. Judge your records, ability. Don't push yourself too much.After judging, decide if you can prepare yourself or need coaching.Be calculative if you want to have a good career and personal life balance. Have long term goals.Think of finance.Don't rely totally on CAT, it is unpredictable. Result is not proportional to skills all the time.If you don't like your job, try your best to continue until you reach the threshold. If you have very strong reasons to quit job, quit. Or else don't. Don't listen to generalized comments or advice.People who love their job and want to settle with it are really lucky!! :D"
CAT,How should I prepare for CAT 2018 if I am starting from now?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-prepare-for-CAT-2018-if-I-am-starting-from-now,"CAT 2018 Aspirant, CSE 2018 Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",100+,"Strategy for CAT preparation could vary significantly from person to person depending on your current abilities and in general, there is no one size fits all strategy that you could refer to. In this answer I will try to write a comprehensive guide assuming an average initial level in all the 3 sections namely VA, DI-LR & QAQuantitative Ability:Probably the favorite section for engineers. A big chunk of CAT aspirants tend to overestimate their skills in this section (including myself in my first attempt when my percentile turned out to be lowest in QA among the 3 sections). Preparation of Quant largely involves two parts, concept and speedConcept:Focus on building your fundamentals first. Solve basic questions from all the topics that you struggle in, don’t time your attempts initially, what matters now is learning and accuracy. Make sure to not leave out any topic, people generally tend to leave out numbers or geometry and put all their time in solving algebra problems or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your prep. Remember to get an access of 99+ percentile in Quant, you need to solve around 28/34 questions (based on recent CAT papers) and leaving out entire topics would not help your cause.Material: Any good textbook or coaching class material should be enough for studying fundamentals. You can also checkout few good Youtube channels.You should ideally be done with the fundamentals of all the topics by July 31st, latest by 10th of August.Speed:Once you have a good grasp on the fundamentals, you can work on building up your speed. Here’s where it gets tricky, simply mugging up tables, ratios, squares and cubes would do little good. The idea is to be able to develop the skill to solve a question without using old school methods.This could involve solving questions using option elimination, rough estimation, logical guesswork etc.But then how do you develop this skill. The answer, as trivial or stupid as it may sound is that you need to stop solving questions using the straight forward, lengthy original methods. Instead, try to solve it using a different, shorter method, try using the options, if the options are numerically far apart try to estimate the range of the answer, just avoid old school!!! (Can’t stress this enough)You can find good examples of how this could be done in the link below:Getting better at CAT QuantBased on observation, for developing speed, questions that are present online (based on your test series) tend to be better than questions in standard textbooksResult: You will notice that you might not be able to find a shortcut in roughly 80% of the questions. But the skill you develop and the amount of time it will save on the remaining 20% will make a huge difference. To illustrate, you will be able to solve around 7 questions in under 45 seconds each as opposed to the average 1.8 to 2 minutes. This gives you roughly 8 to 9 minutes extra in the paper, which could be the difference between a 97 percentile and a 99.5 percentile in Quant.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:A high initial ability is a big plus in this section. But even if you are not very good at verbal in your current stage of preparation, significant improvements can be made that can potentially take you beyond the 99 percentile mark in VA-RCFirst and foremost, if your current level in VA-RC is average you need to solve atleast one Reading Comprehension set every single day. There are no shortcuts here. This worked wonders for me. There are two things you need to focus on while you solve RCs viz. Reading speed and thought flow of the author. I stress on reading speed because it is essential that you are atleast able to read and give a fair attempt to all 34 questions. That’s not going to happen if you take 9 minutes to read an RC.Analyse each RC that you solve. Gradually time your attempts. Every time you read, try and step into the author’s shoes , try to comprehend the reason behind why the article was written in the first place. This will help you tons in those tricky summary and tone of the passage questions. Do not mark options haphazardly, read each answer option carefully, compare it to the context and your understanding of the passage and then attempt. Do not take accuracy for granted. High accuracy does wonders in the VA sections and for that matter all the 3 sections.If you are facing problems in understanding passages and see yourself getting direct questions wrong, then it might be a good idea to go back to basics, invest time there.Moving from direct questions to inference based questions, this is a bit tricky and it’s slightly hard to directly write a guide for this but remember the trick is to be able to see the passage as a logical flow of ideas and not a discrete collection of sentences. When you are able to connect each passage with the next and are able to draw out a logical story where the sum is greater than the parts, you should be able to do fairly well in Inference based questions. So focus on understanding each idea in the passage and how they connect to each other.Be patient, do not lose heart if you don’t see improvements in 5–6 days. You will notice significant difference in a month but stick to the 1+ RC a day formula. You will notice you are able to read faster which will save considerable time.Moving on to Verbal Ability,Again this is a section where improvement takes time, there is no easy way. Tracking your improvement could be even more challenging, since the improvements are gradual.So like every other section, continous practice is the way to go. Spend some time in understanding solutions for questions that you do not get right in the first go. Analysing these questions will significantly boost your skills in VA over time.You can follow the points below for different types of questions in VASummary type questions: Mark 3–4 important points or take-aways in the passage, check all the options for the one which has the most points present from what you have markedOdd-one out: First identify atleast two sentences that would be part of the passages, some sentences would obviously form a pair. See what the common theme is, check if the theme is not present in any of the options or if any of the options cannot not precede or succeed or fit between the pair you have selected, that should be your answer (Obviously, easier said than done)Para-jumbles: Absence of answer options can make these types of questions very tricky. As mentioned in the previous type, start with identifying any of the following if apparent: mandatory pair, obvious opening statement, obvious concluding statement. Build the connect from there onData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:Seeing the difficulty level of this section for the past 3 years, it’s now probably the make or break section in CAT. If you have taken past CATs or seen the questions, you will know what I am talking about.The good part is most people fail to do well in this section not because they are not prepared but either because their strategy is flawed or because they panic on D-day.I will come to the exam strategy part for all the 3 sections later in this answer, let’s first cover how you should prepare for DI-LR.One DI and one LR set every single day (if your current level is average then this is a must do). Do not directly start with practicing CAT level sets, start with basic questions. Once you are comfortable with that, move on to the intermediate level questions. After a few weeks of practice do a few easy sets again and see if you are able to solve them in under 5 mins. That’s the real trick to acing the DI-LR section. It’s not about how hard problems you are able to solve but more about how fast can you solve the easy level questions so that you can devote a fair amount of time to doing the medium level sets on D-Day.Solve all the standard type of sets including arrangements, tournaments, blood relations type questions in LR though there is close to 0% chance that any of these would come in the actual CAT, they will help you build your reasoning skills. Now when you move to the not so standard types, the way you approach them is try to map out a path in your mind that goes from what is given to what you need to find. Sounds vague but trust me it will help. You will get better at it with practice.In DI as mentioned in the QA part , have a strong grip on ratios and percentages. Fast calculations will help you do the direct questions (quite rare these days) quickly. For the non-direct ones, well again it will only come with practice. But the general approach is the same as mentioned, try to map out a way from given to what is to be found.All in all, probably the most important take away for this section is practice, practice and more practice.Bonus: The CAT Writer this blog helped me a lot during my preparation. Make sure you go through all the relevant articles in itCAT-holics This blog covers almost all Quant topics with solved problems. The questions covered in it are better (utility-wise) than what you will find in most books. Certainly a must do!Few general points:Do not panic at any point during the exam, remember, if you find the paper difficult, others are probably feeling the same. So, focus on getting max questions rightSimilarly, do not get carried away if you think the paper is easy. The worst thing you can do is get complacent mid-examYour preparation should ideally peak in September through mid October, do not exhaust yourself in the last two weeks before the test, it will do you no goodMake sure you subscribe to atleast 2 good test series, do not miss tests and analyse all the tests that you give, attempting alone without doing a post result analyses is practically uselessLastly, CAT could be a dicey exam. Do not lose heart if you are not able to do well because of some reason. It's not the end of the worldI will keep editing the answer as and when I remember more pointsFor strategy on how to attempt the CAT on D-Day you can refer to Gautam Oswal's answer to What could be the best strategy for attempting CAT paper?All the Best!Special credits: Tony Xavier","CAT is an online comprehensive entrance exam for MBA pursuits. It is a gateway, an opportunity to study in the most prestigious and brilliant colleges. It comprises of 3 sectionsQuantitative Aptitude, this one is all about elementary level of maths. You all need to revise and practice them thoroughly.Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation, this one is all about your common sense, logic and analytical skills. You should also work on your calculations and arithmetic skills to excel in this section.Reading Comprehension and Verbal ability, this section is all about your grammatical and reading skills. So, if you have been an avid reader in your school time it will benefit you but if you do not then start reading novels and newspaper right now.As, you are planning planning for CAT 18 you have ample of time to prepare and instead of rushing through the course hurriedly you can go for in-depth study plan preparing smoothly all through out. Each of these sections consist of various sub-topics and concepts that you need to prepare rigorously. As a result you will easily able to attempt any question in the exam. As said, ‘Practice makes man perfect’, you need to follow the same rule. You have to practice a lot and you can too. Give mock and solve past papers they are extremely significant and integral part of CAT preparation.You can even join a classroom or online program for expert guidance. I feel online program is much more convenient and easy to follow up if you are working simultaneously . A excellent and a leading online program for CAT aspirants is HANDA ka Funda .HANDA ka Funda’s online program provides the best preparation for CAT. From explaining basics to solving doubts it provides a round a clock assistance in everything. It has more than 750+ videos for concept understanding along with solved examples on each of them to learn their applicability. It gives you access to discussion forums where you can discuss your queries with other students and Ravi Handa sir as well. He also conducts live sessions on weekends to personally clear your problems and doubts.For more information you can visit this link: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams","A quick intro to my credentials:VARC: 79.94(99.63 percentile)LR-DI: 40.62(98.14 percentile)QA: 73.76 (98.95 percentile)Overall scaled score 194.32 (99.74 percentile)I'll try to answer assuming you have only a little knowledge of QA, LRDI , VARC. First of all, and this is very important, you should know the reason why you are attempting the CAT. Why I am saying this is that most people don't know what they are doing and why are they doing so. It is necessary to know your reason and use it to work hard.There are a lot of education institutes that help students prepare for CAT, but I would recommend TIME because their classroom programme has really helped me step up my game. In addition to that TIME’s study material covers basics very well. A very important thing here is to give AIMCATs or mock CATs to understand where are you lagging, what kind of mistakes are you making, how to remedy those mistakes, which areas to skip(do not think one too early), how can you improve your accuracy , uniqueness of these questions - repetitive or new concepts or a new dressing on the same concept. This will also help you know your forte which instills a new confidence(helpful many a times…lol). Take a note of your mental state too. Jot down these things in a diary or keep them in mind.Now let us delve into the specific subjects:VARC:Read newspapers: Make it a habit to read Economic Times daily or Business Standard. I would recommend Economic Times because it provides with a wide range of news from diverse topics. Use this to improve your reading speed (focus on accuracy not on speed), comprehension and to build up a good vocabulary. You'll learn some phrasal verbs, some idioms(not needed in cat, useful anyhow) and it also helps with grammar.Wren and Martin High School English Grammar and Composition: This book has been put together specially for Indian Subcontinent. It provides ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension and other allied areas to improve English communication.Tata McGraw Hill How to prepare for VARC by Arun Sharma: An awesome book. I‘ll admit it is tough, but it helps immensely.Merriam Webster App: Play the vocabulary game. It’s addictive, fun and helping.Read books : This has been suggested invariably by all my English teachers to improve comprehension and build vocabulary but i emphasize on it because it improves medium term memory(little eroded by RCs). Not necessary though!LR-DI: I attended my classes regularly and gave mocks. I sometimes used Arun Sharma’s books 1 and 2. It is sufficient. My LR-DI section was pretty weak, but these things helped me score decently.QA: QA was my forte. But a dry spell in QA was all that was needed to trim my overconfidence. Again, I used Arun Sharma Sir’s books and have to say I was surprised at my ignorance. The tips and tricks that sir has mentioned not only improved my efficiency but also my speed.Last things last, prepare well for CAT. Focus on knowledge. Use poor results as motivation. Use mediocre results as motivation. Use good results as motivation. Maintain a healthy mental state. Take some breaks regularly. Thanks to my friends,I could keep calm. I would get anxious or stuck in self-doubt and they’d help me to regain energy. Maintain a good physical health. 30–60 minutes of brisk walking is enough. And don’t beat up yourself for anything, just try to move past it(take the lesson ans use it wisely).Disclaimer: I did all the things above, but not even to 25% levels. So keep calm and prosper.","First of all find out each and every information related to CAT, likeOpportunities after CATNo of students present in examLast year exam analysis ( At how many number, how much percentile occur)SyllabusPaper LevelMake your percentile goalAfter seen all the information then make a strategy. A person can help you to guide you only the way but you have to put the actual effort that will make the result.Begin with the end in mind:Start your preparation with sheer determination and self motivation. Whenever you Whenever you get distracted, you can dream about the day when you will crack the exam and it will definitely motivate you.Syllabus:This is a useful tip for almost any exam. Before starting you must be aware that what will ask in exam and keep a point in mind that you have to creak the exam not to do Ph.D on syllabus. You have to prepare only that part that is asked in exam. The syllabus is divided into 3 sections:Quantitative Ability (QA) [34 Questions]Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DILR) [32 Questions]Verbal & Reading Comprehension (VARC) [34 Questions]The concepts used in this examination are broadly of class 10 level but the questions are little bit tricky. To solve a paper in a given time limit it require good amount of logical thinking and lots of practice.For complete detail of syllabus you can go through my previous answer: Deepak Saini's answer to What is the syllabus of the CAT?Join coaching:It is always better to have a guide/mentor when you prepare for a competitive exam. Now the days online courses are best choice for preparation of CAT because of flexibility and affordability.Online courses when compared to classroom courses has following benefits:No wastage of time in traveling.Affordable.Durable.Flexible.24*7 access to courses.Login anytime & anywhere.Very helpful for working professionals and undergraduates preparing for CAT.Paperless study, Hence it supports Digital IndiaYou can go through the online course that may help you to boost your knowledge and preparation: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking ExamsThe features of there online CAT course are:Experienced CAT FacultyCAT Preparation Video TutorialsLive CAT Coaching ClassesTest SeriesStudy MaterialExtremely AffordableLive classes for doubt clarificationNow you need to decide what is best option for you.Test Series:Subscribe any one good test series but that test series must more difficult than actual CAT exam. Because when you have a habit of writing difficult test and scoring well then a confidence built itself and you will self-motivated automatically.Whenever you write test then keep ensure some little things:Every test on fix day & time.Sit in proper position.No disturbance during test.Write every test like a actual CAT exam.After writing 20–25 test actual CAT is no longer stranger to you and definitely you will score a good marks.Hope this will helps you.Good luck for your future endeavors.Cheers!!!"
CAT,How was your CAT 2018 paper?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-your-CAT-2018-paper,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",13,"I wrote cat for the third time in a row. I had admission offers from new and baby iims but I decided to give it one more shot. The biggest blunder I had done was to leave my job. And before you read any further let me advice you not to do the same, no matter what. So, my exam was in slot 2. The day earlier I watched friends and andaz apna apna to cool down. I had given around 35 mocks, so I was pretty confident that I'm gonna nail it.On the exam day the biometric and every thing went smooth.Then starts the exam. Varc has not been my favorite, but I went there with a mindset just to clear the cutoffs. In cat 2016 I failed to clear sectional in this and had paid the price. To my surprise VA seemed pretty easy. Rc were readable but had few tricky questions with closer options. I managed to mark 24 somehow. God knows at what accuracy. I was relieved after this section as the nightmare I thought was over.Dilr is something I enjoy. I love solving puzzles. I was prepared for a tough section but to my surprise there were 2 extremely easy sets which everyone must have attempted. I cracked 4 sets in about 50 min. But got carried away while solving 5th one. And the section got locked.Qa is my forte. I've scored 99pc in qa for 2016&17 cat. And as all the IIMs were boasting about diversity and all, nearly every mock from every institute had easy qa section. Maybe that's why people are crying alot over qa. I went through the paper to find that the section is difficult. I started with round strategy but not many were lower hanging fruits. Also, the problems and calculations as well, were lengthy and took time. I managed to solve 21 questions here.Overall, I enjoyed the paper. I didn't feel as much heat as people are shouting and crying. It was a pretty decent paper. All the papers in 2002–2008 were far far difficult than this one.People got to remember one thing, if it was hard for you it will be same for everyone. In this case lower attempts could fetch you great percentile. What matters the most in this case is the accuracy.Cat 2016- 95pcCat 2017–96.9 pcEdit; Those asking aboout leaving job-yes its extremely difficult to manage prep with job in hand. but believe me when you go for an interview, they grill you based on the same. there will be many with great profiles + job experience. So, the panel will ask you if they did manage to, what was the problem in your case? until and unless you have a stellar profile or very strong reason i recommend not doing so. Maybe you can find a job where you dont have to devote full attention for the whole day.About QA- Cause I'm a mechanical engineer, and this is what we do! I mean, we may be not great readers, don't read a lot, or run very fast... but damn it, we can crunch numbers and solve QA.","My exam was in slot 1.First let me give a brief about my profile:10th | 12th | Graduation - 96% | 89.3% | GPA - 7.3Work experience - 3 years.CAT 2017 - 84.5 %ile.Now, My CAT 2018 attempts are :VARC(28), LRDI(20), QA(18)I was quite confident before the exam as i knew that i was well prepared for the exam. I had taken about 30 full length mock tests that helped me a lot to manage the time and make a guess about the difficulty level of questions.All thanx to my mock test practice, I made it a habit to spend first 5 minutes in analyzing the questions and determining the order in which i would attempt question.VARCRC were based on common topics like second world war, Consumer behavior etc. So, I didnt find any much difficulty in understanding the context of the passage. Strikingly i found the passages to be or shorter length( I was expecting long passages and had practiced alot). As the usual trend of CAT, most of the questions were based on inferences and had confusingly similar options but I was well taught the tricks to handle these question by my mentors. So, after a bit brainstorming I used to get to the correct answer.I did plastic pollution passage at first as I found it relatively easy followed by passages on world war and then consumer behavior.Verbal portion was very similar to last years paper. I didn’t find much in verbal portion worthy of talking.Overall, VARC was confusing but of moderate difficulty level.LRDILRDI portion is generally considered the toughest part of CAT exam and It proved to be the one. Even after determining the sequence in which i would attempt the section, i was stuck in the very first LR. I spend about 12 minutes there but the good part was i somehow managed to find the answers to all the questions.Overall, LRDI portion was Difficult. I talked to a lot of people at my center and most of them had attempted 15 or less.QuantsI personally felt geometry was the toughest part of QA section. IIMC maintained its legacy of setting the worst QA paper.There were a lot of NON-MCQ questions. Despite that the difficulty level of the section was touching heights. I felt the QA section was filled with Arithmetic questions. So, It became a bit lengthy also.Overall, Quants section came as a surprise to those who don’t know the trend of IIMC. We were warned about this by our mentors. So, we were on the safe side.I checked my response sheet with the answer key released by various institutes. My wrong attempts are:VARC - 2(Negative marking Ques) + 2( Non - negative/TITA)LRDI- 1(Negative Marking)Quants- 1 (TITA)These are my wrong attempts.After doing the required mathematics, I am getting 177 marks.For this score, I am quiet confident of getting 99+ percentile, rest depends on the level of competition.If you want to know about the my CAT journey and best coaching institutes for CAT visit my answer.Ayush Bhatnagar's answer to Which is the best MBA coaching institute in Delhi? How is it better than the other institutes?For any help, you can message me.Please upvote if this helps you.","100%ile aspirers can skip the answer.I gave up CAT preparation in august as I thought my preparation was going no where, my mock scores didn’t cross 100 marks and I seriously thought of giving GATE another chance. But I don’t think my giving up affected my CAT score phenomenally because of following reasons:VA/RC:I am pretty good at RC. I read books to my extent, so no problem in VARC I attempted 25 questions (Dunno about accuracy though) but I did my level best.DI/LR:The actual reason I gave up CAT because I thought DI/LR being tough and I got single digit marks and attempted questions in single digit only in mocks. So, I would not make it to 99%ile zone,so no IIM calls, so no MBA. So, I gave up and started preparing GATE but as I was in exam hall and solving sets, I had feeling that it didn’t have anything which needed stupendous amount of practice and solving all the difficult sets from mocks and books. Definitely tough section but key to success lies in finding easy sets and a medium set, so that you solve 12–16 questions correctly and you will be through. There will be no time to solve more questions than that and if somebody tells you he/she solved more than that it means they have affected their accuracy. Solve 15–18 questions with full accuracy and you will have 99%ile. I solved 13 questions.(Dunno about accuracy though). Easy sets will be time consuming.Bekar Ki Mehnat Mat KaroQuant:Definitely tough and was a very unpleasant surprise. CAT quants from 2015–17 was very easy. If you knew basic maths you could solve but this year quant had questions which needed practice (a lot of practice precisely) and if my giving up affected CAT score it was in this area. I knew after the exam that if I hadn’t given up I would have scored well. I attempted 11 questions(Dunno about accuracy though). Before attempting even one question 20 minutes elapsed and somebody was cutting onions near me because I had tears in my eyes during quant (They shouldn’t allow onions in exam hall)Thoughts for the CAT:CAT became my favorite exam as it tests intelligence rather than memory (Though You should remember few formula but it’s only few)There is no need of coaching. I took online coaching but it didn’t affect my performance.All you need for CAT exam is Arun Sharma’s book and nothing else. Please follow no other book especially for DI/LR.Certain amount of practice more than enough(2 hours per day for 5 months)Don’t give up on exam otherwise you will regret like me laterEnjoy your learning days without stressing too much and please don’t feed your mind with plethora of questions, sets and passages because if exam is tough then it will be tough for all and everybody is human like you and will work hard only as much as you are.( If you are working quite hard though)Before exam meditate by chanting OM.BANAT BANAT BAN JAI——LAHIRI MAHASAYA","Finally dream day is done …with lot of confusions, assumptions, unpredictabilty and what not.Cat 2018 slot 2 exam went like a meery round.To begin with ..1.The devil in the maskVERBAL:First ,the passages seem to be easy and not confusing. So for many the section may be easy and went peacefully. Almost everyone attempted more than 25/34.But here comes the twist…did u observe that there are lot of ambiguity and confusion while answering ,especially RC. There are 2 similar answers out of which one is correct. So don’t believe if people says this section is easy…to conclude your score in this section depends critically upon your accuracy not the number of attempts…which test takers will realize soon :)2.DILR:Verbal gave a feeling of peace ..but as you go into dilr it was a bit changing. Though it was easier than cat 2017 …still it is tough compared to other years. To my shock, there are no arrangement questions from LR, and the DI was not calculative intensive but a bit more data to interpret..means it will take more time than average to complete a set.3.Night mareQUANT:Is this even a fully solvable section..every question is mutli layered and damn time taking.R.I.P for quant 2018…i am sure it will be the toughest quant paper in cat history.So overall, for me verbal is more tricky than what people are analysing and the other sections are similar .But cat 2018 is tougher than cat 2017..I am expecting a score of 155 is enough for 99 percentile and 100–110 for 90 percentile."

CAT,How should working people aiming to take the CAT manage their preparations with work?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-working-people-aiming-to-take-the-CAT-manage-their-preparations-with-work,"Working Professionals Preparing for CAT Exams, CAT Preparation, Exam Strategies, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",100+,"I graduated now from IIM B. I prepared for CAT while I was working. I used to leave from home by 9.30 - 10 times in morning and be back in home by 9 - 10 after dinner from work. Some days, I had to stay in office late. My work comes under the category of hectic ( mentally, not physically ). This is what I did for the written CAT exam. Spend one hour every day in the morning, going through the chapters (Apti, DI, LR). I had materials, and I went chapter by chapter some day and random questions some day. Ensured I solved 20 problems in the beginning and as I progressed the speed increased tremendously. In office, open a browser tab and go to Arts & Letters Daily . Ensured I read three articles each day before I leave office. I'm generally curious, so I would read some random things without any background. Helped a lot in RC. The Hindu, Business standard in browser tab in office. Read in between meetings, when I was distracted etc. But, utilize time in office. Along with wordweb. Everyday, walk for 20 minutes or so in the night leisurely and recite to myself all multiplication tables ( 1 to 20 )Squares of numbers, cubes of numbers Calculate % components for 1/2, 1/3 ... 1/15 Take 5 random numbers and compute their squares and cubes ( short cut ways ) I know the set of people who are preparing for CAT; we especially had a guy who is very motivated and he would provide us the problems that are challenging & we would spend time discussing quickly. Mostly casual chat types. In our office, it was appreciated to prepare for exams and hence this was easy. Weekends, I gave one mock test, either from home or test center. I would try to solve the problem after the exams ( the ones I was not able to find quick solutions for ) & see if there are options. This would be complete in the weekend itself. Overall, CAT is about being in touch with the basics. You can solve the paper if you are given twice the time. It is all about speed and accuracy. These will not come unless you are in regular touch. Allot small amounts of time every day and you will surely crack it. All the best for your CAT...!!! ","CAT is very difficult to handle with 9 to 6 job, but it has to be done. I started my CAT preparation after I completed 2 years at work and finally nailed it with 1.5 years of preparation. I have experienced how difficult it is to maintain work-life balance. Thus, preparing CAT along with work is next to impossible for many. Thus, it leads to two extreme steps. Either the aspirant leaves his job or he leaves his dream of an IIM tag.Leaving the job for CAT is too risky because of the unpredictability of the exam. If you are thinking of taking the other step, then this post is not for you. You may scroll down to read some other post.I am assuming the following conditions are satisfied to follow the steps mentioned in this post:1. Saturday & Sunday off. (Weekend off)2. Total time 12 hours outside the home. (Office + travel time + etc.)3. You have only one goal in your life and i.e. CAT.Some of you may get off on some other days or work unevenly on various days. So for the people whom the above assumptions are not valid. Please accommodate the schedule as per your ease.1. Treat each section equally: - Considering the increasing difficulty level of DI & LR with every passing year and high unpredictability of VA, do not live under the veil that you can cover one section with another. Focus on all the sections.2. Weekdays: - On weekdays allocate 6 (8-2 = 6) hrs. for studying (2 hrs. for each of the four sections mentioned below)(i) QA: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals/books. You can use any of the two mocks (IMS, Time).(ii) DI/LR: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. You can use any of the three mocks (IMS, CL, Time). Practice as many sets as you can.(iii) VA/RC: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. IMS mocks provides you the closest RC that you may get in CAT. You can practice from Time also but RC from Time is a bit lengthy and contains a bit easier question. The VA/RC section of last two years CAT was most similar to IMS mocks. You can use office time to practice old mocks, sectional, etc. (Given you utilize the time judiciously. Trust me, it is achievable.)(iv) Newspaper Reading (The Hindu Editorial): - This should be finished at the office. Do not carry this task to home. 9 to 6 job provides you enough free time to read the newspaper. If you do not get enough time during lunch or while traveling, then you can follow other alternatives. Copy the editorial/article and paste it in either XLSX or notepad and read it. This way you will be at your cubicle and can utilize your time well. Do this whenever you get free time. Don't restrict yourself to only newspaper and diversify your readings.3. Weekends/Holidays: - On weekends/ holidays allocate minimum 12.5 hrs. for studying.(i) 7.5 hrs. for studying (2.5 hrs. to each section).(ii) 3 hrs. for mock.(iii) 2 hrs. for mock analysis.4. Till August: - You should finish QA theory & formulas, all concepts of DI & LR and the basic understanding of different question types in VA & RC.5. September & October: -(i) You should only do revision and attempt mocks and sectionals.(ii) You Should give at least 2 mocks each weekend with their analysis. Do not miss any center-based mocks. Attempt them at the center to prepare yourself for the exam like scenarios. (It will make you feel comfortable on D day).6. Last month (November): -(i) 1 mock each day and along with its analysis.(ii) I would advise taking a month leave before CAT. If it is not possible then take at least 2 weeks off before the exam and give mocks at exactly the exam time.7. Meanwhile, take out time to pursue your hobbies. Keep in mind CAT is not the end, it is just the beginning of your DREAM.All the Best. Please feel free to ask any query in the comment section.To get answer of all other Query Please Join.Log into Facebook | Facebook","IT IS NOT AT ALL DIFFICULT. Period. Always keep this in mind.CAT is an exam for which you need not put in several hours of preparation daily for months. Your preparation and performance will depend A LOT on where you stand right now. If someone is comfortable with Maths, Reasoning and/or English already, the entire preparation will revolve more around developing speed and polishing the strategy with which one approaches the paper. However, CAT is not that easy either, it is not the paper that makes this exam tough but rather, the high amount of competition.Note that, the major constraint for us here is TIME. So, we’ll try and do these 2 things -Reduce investing time in unnecessary activities other than what’s really important.The time that we invest in CAT prep, it must have high RoI. (So, no reading newspapers, past papers, old mock tests etc)Keeping this in mind, these are some key points (in no specific order) which will help you in preparing for CAT alongside working -Get hold of study material from any institute and make sure that you go through at least QA and LR from start to end ASAP. This is extremely important.A very important thing (that most people don't do) is that every time you try and solve questions, do it with time limit. It will be much more effective if you get used to solving questions in time limit from day 1.Try and manage 3 hours at least on alternate days, this will be needed when you write mock tests on weekdays.Try and utilise your travel time to office for revision. Maintain a thick notebook with all the QA formulas/tricks and LR concepts/tricks and keep updating it with every mock/sectional test you give.Mental calculations are very important. Practice this all the time, even while working.Instead of investing time in novels/newspapers, invest that same amount of time in solving RC passages on various themes and topics (With a time limit of course). This way, you'll practice a lot of reading as well as you'll also practice spotting answers for questions.Take mock test very seriously, and its analysis even more seriously. Write a mock only if you’re sure that you can focus. Do not write a mock when you’re super tired or are sure that you’ll be disturbed in between. More importantly, focus a lot on the analysis part. Identify where you went wrong. Go through the solution of the test thoroughly and write all the new formulae/tricks mentioned in the ‘thick notebook’ mentioned above.Once you start mocks, maintain an excel sheet to keep track of questions in VA and QA topic wise. After every mock, during analysis, just fill this excel sheet.At the end, apply a formula that will give you details about % attempt (Attempt/Total*100) and % accuracy (Correct/Ateempt*100) topic wise. After 10-15 mocks, you'll be very clear about which topic you are attempting less, where your accuracy is pathetic etc etc. It will help you much more than you realise.DO NOT try to do too many things. Someone will try and do mocks, various books from Indian authors, even GMAT books, then lots of reading, then improve grammar with several grammar improvement books, then vocab improvement books, solving questions on Pagalguy, solving questions on various sites, various study materials etc etc etc. KEEP IT SIMPLE. Don't get caught up with all this. Don't ask for too many suggestions. Talk to a few good people, make a good plan that you feel will work for you and just do it.Maximise your efforts during the weekends, significantly reduce hanging out with friends, movies etc.STOP WASTING TIME.Trust me, it is not difficult at all. I too did it in my first CAT attempt. I had an extremely demanding on-field job as a construction engineer and was able to spare only 2-3 hours per day 6 days a week for the preparation. On Friday (Weekend in Algeria), I used to study for around 6-8 hours. As this was my first attempt, I had to start from scratch. Moreover, I didn’t have any books or materials with me to study from so I had to look for concepts and questions on the internet. All the best.NEVER SETTLE","Given the changing nature of CAT (which at a fundamental level has remained more or less the same) and the preparation required to 'crack' an exam of this kind, planning becomes extremely important in addition to the natural skillset.Considering you have taken CAT 2015, you are now aware of three things:1. Verbal preparation is not really prep prep but something that needs to be done over a long period2. Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation requires vast exposure to different kind of questions and logic(s)3. A simple formula based approach and sticking to level of difficulty 1-2-3 in Quant is good enoughAlso read: Prasad Sawant's answer to Does CAT 2015 Stands a benchmark for future test pattern?When you are taking a second attempt at a test like this, your preparation strategy is quite different from your first attempt strategy. First attempt is like learning how to swim. You flounder, you need help, your strokes are without finesse and you somehow manage to stay afloat. And unless you do that, you don't reach the next level. But once you have learned what's required, you become better. Then you focus on cutting the water at a certain angle, perfecting your strokes, increase your lung capacity and strength, and finally, you become a good swimmer.Coming back to your question, let's start planning your day:Work day: 24 hours - (9 hours of work, 2 hours of travel, 7 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 2 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 2 hoursNon-work day: 24 hours - (10 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 5 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 7 hoursAssuming you are dedicated enough, you will roughly have about 24 hours per week for preparation. This time can be divided as (Strong section: 7 hours, Moderate section: 8 hours, ""I-am-not-good-at-this"" section: 9 hours) Preparation means: Understanding concepts + solving questions without time limit/with time limit. One of the biggest mistakes before the second attempt is confusing familiarity and conceptual clarity. In the first six months of the calendar year, focus on preparation. In the remaining five months, focus on mocks and test taking strategy and practice. The reason why I am not sharing a time table and talking broadly in terms of hours is because I think everyone is different and needs to have a custom plan. Only you can draft that for yourself. The next thing is to sustain the motivation and having a discipline to stick to that plan (DIFFICULT part)Post June/July, you should not feel the need to go back to the concepts book. The idea of putting more hours in the first six months is to reduce to effort required in the second half. People start getting serious 2 months before the CAT when it's already late. Then nothing helps. Also, before you start your plan for CAT 2016, sit and do a thorough analysis of your last year preparation and performance. What different things are you going to do this time to ensure a significantly better result? Create a monthly plan which is further divided in weeks and days. Keep a little buffer in case a topic is difficult to understand or long. Extreme specificity might not be required (for e.g. morning 30 minutes on 27th January for understanding sum of roots from algebra) but a broad topic wise and section wise plan is better. Once the plan is in place, understand what material will help you achieve it. Coaching institute material + past papers + 2-3 good books should suffice. Apart from that, focus on reading anything and everything to improve your VA RC skills and Puzzles and brain teasers to improve your overall aptitude.If you have specific things to ask, you can always message me. Hope this helps. All the best."
CAT,Is the CAT a tough exam?,https://www.quora.com//Is-the-CAT-a-tough-exam,Common Admission Test (CAT),58,"Okay. I am going to post a different reply here. By ‘different’ I mean its not the usual success story that you commonly see from CAT toppers where they have cracked the exam within 2 attempts with just under 6 months of preparation.You have many websites for those success stories - GPkafunda.com, Careers 360 and MBA UNiverse. Websites like these post only the story of the toppers. You hardly get to hear the other side of the story if you follow only what they have to say. And why not?. If they start doing so, then their market would vanish overnight.I am going to follow the words of our late President APJ Abdul Kalam-“Dont read success stories, you get only the message. Read failure stories, you get ideas to success”and going to give a more realistic picture of this exam.As a person who has been bitten by this exam 4 times- I feel I have to give out my opinion when I saw this question come up in my feed.The straight answer to this question is- YES. CAT is tough. But the word ‘tough’ has got nothing to do with the content or the syllabus or the preparation.CAT- being a competitive exam, suffers from the same three shortcomings that almost all other competitive exams in India( like GATE, IBPS, IITJEE, AIEEE, UPSC) suffer from- competition, reservation and irrational admission criteria.Its important to know about these three things before you attempt this test.Heavy competition: About 2 lakh people on an average give CAT every year. And guess how many seats are there in all IIMs put together?. Just 4000. Is it not fair to say that the odds are always stacked up against you?. This is one factor which will always bring you down. You can think that you are well prepared. But there will be atleast 20 people who are probably more well prepared than you. This is not unique to CAT, but its unique to any government level entrance exam in India.Reservation: Now, dont get me wrong. I know its there because of social justice and all. And I am not asking anyone to cite reservation as an excuse in case you fail. But, even an SC student will find it difficult to an extent as the cut-off for the top IIMs would still be >90 percentile. You can check it here- http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/users....Admission criteria: A lot of B-schools look at your 10th , 12th scores as a pre-requisite. This is very unfair- IMO. Because you may not have performed well in your 10th Boards due to a variety of reasons. For example- my grand-dad died just 2 days before my 12th Board exams were to start. It was a painful experience for me as he was quite close. As a result- I could not concentrate much. Luckily I managed to score 93% overall aggregate. And my brother had developed a sudden viral fever during his 10th Boards. He could not concentrate for the first few days.Apart from these three factors, there is one which is unique to CAT- the normalization process. This used to be a big deal till CAT 2013. Since there are multiple slots, there is a possibility that one slot might have had a relatively easier question set compared to others. Thus the scores of the easier slots are normalized to a scaled standardized score out of 450 and then you are ranked based on that. And how this normalization is done- remains a million dollar question.And none of these factors are under your control. How is your 10th performance supposed to be a deciding factor in your selection?. Your social circumstances could have been different. Your level of schooling would have been different, your guidance and financial status would have been different. All these are NOT taken into account by the top IIMs.Point is- to eliminate the heavy competition, B- schools use these tricks as a means of filtering out students.Now coming to the much hyped ‘difficulty level’ of CAT. I think that this is probably where most success stories you hear from toppers are centered around. The actual syllabus is just elementary maths and English. And its not that difficult to solve these questions once you remove the three factors I mentioned above.I tried a simple experiment. I gave some 10 questions from one of the previous AIMCAT papers to the son of my next-door-neighbour, who is studying in Class 11. He solved all 10 of them correctly within 15 mins!!.And AIMCAT is regarded as one of the toughest CAT prep series conducted by TIME.Why was he able to solve when most of us cant?. Because he is in touch with the syllabus, when most of us are not. Thats the key ingredient you must know.There are three sections in CAT according to the latest 2015 pattern.SECTION- 1: VERBAL ABILITY and READING COMPREHENSIONThis contains a lot of commie level type of passages. The kind you commonly find in editorials of newspapers like the Economic Times, NYT and the Hindu. Most of them would be centered around some topics like - economics, art history, Greek literature, language and semantics, ancient civilizations etc… Atmost 70- 80% of the passages are from these areas. You can read newspapers editorials to get the hang of it. Or else you can try Arts & Letters Daily .SECTION- 2: LOGICAL REASONING and DATA INTERPRETATIONI just hate this section- to tell you the truth. I mean all these complex kinds of bar-graphs and pie-charts , the amount of mind-boggling data you have to process manually. I find this section the most irrelevant. In my experience of the real world- there are scientific calculators and any chart can be easily computed today using Microsoft Excel formulae. Thats how its being done in most organizations. I really feel that this section should be done away with- or atleast we can give a reduced weightage.But what I really like about this section is that its fun. Total fun when you remove the time constraint. And the next best thing is that you need not require any knowledge on complex formula- like you have to remember for Quant related topics. All you have to do is to understand the data given and correlate the various graphs. Most of the questions in this section could be solved when you tabulate all the data in a single table or a single graph.SECTION-3: QUANTITATIVE ABILITY:Probably the most easiest of all. Some may be surprised at this, because they are most likely to have forgotten what they have learnt in their 10th and 12th Maths. But the NCERT books can really be a good foundation with which you can attempt this section. Questions asked are from the following areas.Geometry and Mensuration- Questions on circles, triangles, polygons and properties.Permutation and Probability- Selection, arrangements.Number Theory- Remainder Theorem, Factor theorem.Progressions- AP, GP, HP, Number series.Algebra- equations, functions and graphs.Business Maths- Profit and Loss, SI& CI, RPVs etc…Most of these topics can be found in NCERT text books or you can even refer your old Maths book- if you still have it. Once you have written all the basic formula in a paper, you can easily tabulate them accordingly as to when you should apply which formula.Once this is done- you can solve a lot of sectional tests Probably the most important step. Most are available for free- if you are going with self-study.Or you can enroll in one the coaching centers and take them too- this is the best course for first-timers.But even after doing all this- you have to be prepared for the worst. Like I said before- if you think you are prepared, there are atleast 20 more people who are more well-prepared than you.The difference between the absolute raw scores( not scaled scores) of a 90 percentiler and a 100 percentiler might not be much( most probably a difference of 50–70 marks, going by what I used to analyze with my mock scores). And percentile ranking is flawed to an extent. Its a ranking system - just a relative score and not an absolute way to judge your talent.In summary: Yes, CAT is tough and unique- in its own respect. It has got its own share of flaws too. Its foolish to compare it with JEE/GATE and say that its easier. Its like comparing apples with oranges.","CAT isn’t difficult at all . It is an exam which tests your coolness and decision making power. CAT is all about choosing the right question and leaving a question if it takes much time of yours(Only by constant practice,u can increase the speed and choose the right question).And you should also understand that the colleges doesn’t consider your score and they consider your percentile only. The main reason for failure in cat is the “aspirants ego”(Don’t mistake me guys).Because we test takers, when we did not get the solution for an easy question, we get tensed and try to solve that question, which may eat up our valuable minutes.Strategy to be followed acc. to my point of view:If u r strong in basics then ok; else clear your basics of q,v,r in a month or two(one month is actually enough).Then start solving aimcat test series(Note: Need not solve all qns in ur course books; start aimcat asap)Understand the concepts from course books and then start solving the aimcat series from January itself(THIS IS IMPORTANT: pls pls start aimcat from jan itself; even if u dint complete ur course books).And don’t ever skip any aimcat. Taking aimcat is important but the more imp. thing is reviewing your aimcat papers thoroughly before giving your next aimcat .Reviewing is not all about understanding the “no idea” qns alone. It’s about finding the shortcuts for each qns and sticking to the fastest way of solving the qns. And it’s also important to read the newspapers daily in order to improve ur vocabulary, reading speed(words per min needs to be increased drastically).It helps a lot in GD too.","No.Cracking CAT is not tough. CAT is an aptitude test. You need to be in high spirits built with good practice. That is the key.Lots of people take the CAT prep too hard on themselves, this ain’t fair. Reason: CAT is an aptitude exam, you can do awesome on your day! It is not a syllabus coverage based exam. It is about solving the questions you know well -an exam of calm mind - selection of easy to moderate questions and solving them!But, the other side is also not cool - you should not just do nothing or do bits and pieces.What I advice my students is to practice hard till a month before CAT and then relax a month before CAT - only do basic revision and give a few mocks. Keep your calm in the final month. Aptitude, once built, stays for long. So practice and then relax and enter CAT.Load nahi lene ka guys!Best wishesRahul SirFollow my CAT prep group on: CAT Prep with IIM A alumni","Is CAT exam really tough? It just might be and at the same time, it might not be. How? Simple, not all humans are same and not everyone have same logical and metal aptitude. Not everyone is preparing the same way you are, Not everyone have been disciplined enough to prepare, Not everyone have their basics clear or have a good vocabulary skills.It is up to you to decide where to land and where do you want to see yourself. Lets take a quick peek at what CAT is,Quant 1.Basic Quant: 12 to 14 questions, This section accounts for Maths that we learn in our 6–9th grades. These contain basic topics like percentages Profit/Loss and what not. Now it depends for person to person on how much time allocation needs to be. Books like Rd Sharma are enough for this section.2.Data Interpretation: 15 to 17 questions, This section is all about reading charts and graphs and analysing the data given , and hence it does not require much practisce until you are like a year to give your exam3.Data Sufficiency : 2 to 3 questions4.Geometry and Algebra : 17 to 18 questions: This is a slightly more tougher topic and you will need some certain professional help in order to master this part of the paper. I would highly recommend you buy correspondence packs of institutions like TIME etc.Verbal 1.Reading Comprehensions: 15 to 17 questions: To improve this part one must read read an dread. There is no shortcut to master RC’s. It is preferable that you read 500–600 passages as part of the preparation as that is the idle size of an RC expected in the paper itself. As you will read for days you will notice that your reading time per passage is decreasing and you will slowly learn the way of speed reading.2. Logical Reasoning: 15 to 17 Questions: These questions are very basic conceptual based algorithms which you have already prbably done in many Olympiads and stuff, no extra practice must go into it if you have a high aptitude.3. Paragraph Completion/Sentence Rearrangement/ Sentence elimination: 3 questions: This involves deep knowledge of grammar and hence I would recommend you to go through the book called Wren and Martin. Grammar will take time to improve and dont stop your practice once you think that you are thorough enough instead keep practicing this till the last day.4.Text Completion/Word Usage:3 questions: For this high vocab skill set is required and I would recommend you to use Word Power Made easy by Norman Lewis, which has application and roots of many words which will not only help you in your CAT but also in GRE GMAT and what not. An app called VoLT (Vocabulary Learning Technique) is also there which is really helpful as it has pictorial representation of words and really large word list for that matter . Do check it out I found it very helpful.Follow the lead given up here and you be just fine, again all I can comment upon is based on what an average person and candidate would prepare for. Maybe you have a very good base of Maths have been speaking English for the most part of your life, then its a complete different scenario.So keep calm and prepare, No need to be scared. Trust on yourself that YES, you have prepared the best way possible and you will be just fine."
CAT,How do I prepare myself for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-prepare-myself-for-CAT,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation",100+,"The following article describes the way I prepared for CAT (2016). This strategy worked for me and hopefully it works for all you guys as well.WARNING!!! – This is a pretty lengthy but descriptive article so those who don’t have the time, maybe you can come read this later!I started preparing seriously from the month of March. So here it goes:March – May: PRACTISE, PRACTISE PRACTISE!!!I dedicated this period to work on the “Fundas” and getting conceptual clarity on various topics.Before I get onto what I did, I just want to say that if any of you out there want to sign up for an online or offline course where all the necessary Fundas are taught well – then please visit 2IIM’s official website. This is by far the best place to get all your basics right.Here is the link: http://www.2iim.com/The director of 2IIM, Rajesh Balasubramanian himself is an alumni from IIM-Bangalore and to put it in simple words – his style of teaching and more than anything his articles and blogs are AMAZINGG!!Coming back to the main content, my advice to those of you who are just starting your prep will be: focus on practicing as many questions as you can. This is not the time to take full length MOCK CATs.Quant: I had bought TIME material, so I just stuck onto those. Those books are very good and give enough practice for any serious aspirant. The TIME material consists of 3 types of exercises: Conceptual Review, Exercise-(a), and Exercise-(b). So, I solved each and every problem from the TIME books and I feel this is very important because this is when one becomes familiar with all the different types of Quant problems that are likely to come in the actual CAT.DI/LR: Again, to prepare for this section, it takes a lot of practice. So just practice all the problems that are there in the TIME material. When I started solving DI/LR problems, I somehow found that I was able to solve LR problems easier than DI. But the truth is, I feel DI problems are easier to score as once you figure out how to get the answer (which will take less time than in LR), you will invariably get it. Also, the main thing in DI is understanding the given data as quickly as possible and figuring out a way to get a solution with the given data. A similar thing holds good for LR problems as well.Another important thing is, DO NOT use the online calculator for every tiny bit of calculation when solving DIs. You can use it for some end-calculations where there is a complicated division or so involved.VA/RC: This section is something that many engineering aspirants tend to under-prepare. As far as the English section is concerned, it requires consistent practice and the fruits of your efforts can be seen only much later, unlike the other two sections. For RC, the only way to do well is to develop a good reading habit. So, even if you have never had a reading habit, it’s high time you start because RC is all about comprehension. The ability to look out for what is important even as you read will come only when you keep reading. Also, your reading speed will improve only with practice. So while reading RCs, the strategy is to make a mental 1-line summary of every passage, as you read. So once you start answering the questions, you know which passage to go and look at while referring the RC. I figured out these things from Rajesh Balasubraminan’s blog and articles.Here are some of his links:http://catscores.2iim.com/http://iimcat.2iim.comVA section is again only practice. This section has various types of questions like Para-Jumbling, Sentence Correction, Fill in the blanks question, etc. Again, practice literally every single problem there is in the TIME material. That is the only way the next couple of months of your CAT prep will go on smoothly.The essence of what I want to say is solve every single problem in the TIME material. To do that you have to frame a schedule. Back-work and figure out a schedule that you can stick on to so that you will be able to finish all the TIME materials before May. You can divide months into weeks and divide weeks into days and plan what you’ll be doing every day, so that it finally adds up till May. One important thing is to plan a realistic schedule. And by that what I mean is if there are 30 days in a month, don’t plan something for all the 30 days. Keep like a buffer of 5-6 days of nothing, so that if anything spills over from the other days, you can use your buffer days for finishing what you had scheduled.June-August: ACCURACYThis is a good time to start taking your full-length MOCK-CATS. I followed AIMCATs. The whole of Internet is filled with stories of how AIMCATs are much harder than actual CAT. But, personally I never felt so. AIMCATs are approximately of the same difficulty level as the actual CAT. So, take them seriously.Quant: I wanted to get even more practice for all the topics, so I spent about 2 months finishing the Arun Sharma book: LOD-I and LOD-II. I feel Arun Sharma’s Quant book is amazing and it will be useful if you get to practice from this book. So if you have the time, then go ahead and finish solving this book also.DI/LR ,VA/RC: If you are done solving the TIME material, then you should start solving sectional tests that any coaching centre offers. I followed TIME for this. Their sectional tests are good and plenty. I was never able to finish all the tests for any of the sections. But keep doing it till the D-Day.Accuracy is everything so it’s really important to know the right way to analyse your MOCKs. You can find more detailed explanations on Rajesh Balasubramanian’s blogs. But here’s a gist of what I followed:Re-Solve the entire paper.· Make a note of the type of mistakes that you make. I used to tabulate them in an Excel sheet (to make it interesting)For example:o Conceptual Mistakes – because you didn’t know how to do that problem ->Again make a note of the solution.o Silly Mistakes -> Make sure the number of silly mistakes keep reducing with each MOCKo Questions you shouldn’t have attempted -> some questions are too hard/tricky – you should be able to make that judgement before you attempt.o Questions you should have answered, but you didn’t.· There are some types of questions that repeatedly appear in your MOCKs and have also appeared in previous CAT papers.o Ex: Some English words – add them to your vocab list and keep revising them everydayo Some types of Quant problems like – lying milkman, mixtures, compound-to-simple interest ratios.Make a note of such things and revise them everyday.Also, DO NOT keep comparing your percentiles with other people or your immediate previous percentile. Your performance must be measure over a period of time and generally AIR ranks give a better measure of where you stand in the country.September-November: STRATEGY & CONCEPTSThis period is extremely crucial and can be very nerve-racking. This is the time when you’ll have to slowly start forming a strategy as to how you will be answering the questions (in which order and how much time). I followed the following strategy:VA/RC: I decided that I would answer all the RC questions first and then only do VA section. Since, invariably more number of questions were for RC section in my MOCKs. The CAT-2016 pattern was such that the exact number of questions in each section was not known. But I went with the strategy of spending 2/3rd of the time for RC (40mins) and 1/3rd for VA (20mins).DI/LR: Between DI and LR, I had decided that I would do DI first and then LR. In DI, I decided I would do the easiest DIs first. Then I would do the easiest LRs. After this, I should have solved approximately 2 DIs and 2 LRs. Then if I have time, I would go back to the DI section to the DIs that can be done but will take a little more time to do. If there is time even after this (which is very unlikely), I will do the remaining questions from the respective sections.Quant: In this section I decided to spend half the time to literally solve all the very easy problems in the section. There will be at least 10-12 very easy/easy level problems, which you can do and which you should do. Then, in the remaining half of the time, whichever questions I knew how to do, but would take a little time to solve, I did those problems. And during the first half, I would ‘Mark for Review’ the problems which I should do for the second half.Depending on the difficulty level, you should solve anywhere between 20(if section is hard)-30(if section is easy) questions per section to get 98+ or 99+ percentile.Day before CAT: BE POSITIVE!Quite honestly, there is not much preparation that you can do on this day. So just relax! Spend time with people who will encourage you and will make you feel good about yourself. And whatever you do make sure your morale is up and you stay positive. Also, make sure you keep a check on all the important stuff that you need for your exam the next day. Try to get a good sleep! ;)D-Day: TRUST YOUR EFFORTS AND BE EVEN MORE POSITIVE!DON’T go late to the exam centre! The last thing you need is feeling tensed about the small things. Remember to feel good about yourself and your efforts. The more you believe in your efforts, the greater are the chances that you will score well. Also, keep telling yourself that none of your efforts will ever go waste so just have faith in yourself and be positive!If you’ve reached the end of this article, well I got to say: Thanks for taking the time to read and hope this gives you direction for your CAT preparation. All the best for all the aspirants!With that said, I’d like to mention that I had got 96.72 percentile in CAT-2016. As far as I can remember, I attempted 29 questions in VARC, 15 in DILR (it was the hardest section) and 15 in Quant(I messed up my time management a little).My goal was to do PhD in one of the IIMs and get into teaching and management research. So I had applied for the doctoral programme at IIM - A,B, C. This programme is called FPM - Fellow Programme in Management. Will write an article on FPM and how to prepare for it very soon. Most of the entrance exam scores can be used to apply for this. I chose CAT as I wanted to keep my options open - in case I didn’t get FPM, I thought of pursuing MBA.I am currently pursuing FPM in IIMB in the area of Marketing.","A step-by-step guideGo online, google CAT Online Preparation.Click on the second link - one that says online.2iim.com.Sign up as free user, try out a few classesBe reasonably impressed and say “I am going to see what the reviews say about online coaching”Go online and google “CAT Online coaching review”.Check out this link What is your review of 2IIM Online CAT Preparation?Go to Online CAT Coaching and CAT Preparation: Crack CAT 2016 and start preparation.I run 2iim and we guys here believe that CAT preparation should be fun and not overwhelming.

About 2 lacs aspirants appear for CAT examinations. Understandably, competition is very steep.The CAT exam is generally conducted in November each year. You are entitled to appear for the CAT exam if you are a graduate or in the final year of a bachelor’s degree. The CAT exam is a computer-based exam, which consists of the following three sections:Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VRC)Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI & LR)Quantitative Ability (QA)Tips on Preparing for CAT examCAT aspirants should always commence early in preparing for the exams as an early start would suffuse them with an all out knowledge and strategy to go about the examination.English reading , comprehension & Maths reasoning , logical skills are to be primary focus areas in order to cross the hurdle of CAT exams and get admitted in your dream MBA institute.Reading extensively (be it any news paper, magazines, journals, novels) will give that extra edge to get over the reading and comprehension section in CAT examination. Repeated Maths practice will make you a pro, and you will pass with flying colours in the CATS maths section. There are never long equations in CAT, the only thing which works is the smart way of calculations which can be mastered by practicing the tricks available in books and internet.You must associate yourself with the people who have successfully cracked the CAT exams and imbibe confidence and take useful tips from them. CAT students should look at questions from previous years' CATs and understand its syllabus.A mandatory part of your CAT preparation would be to take online mock tests and sharpen your abilities, ideas and timing as far as taking on the examination is concerned. In this context you should asses the mock test results and work on your shortcomings before taking the final plunge.Managing one's time includes balancing speed with accuracy, handling the pressure and uncertainty and the apt decision making.learning to allocate time while answering to various sections of the CAT exam paper is very essential. It is so since you need to finish the paper on time with almost all the correct answers to score maximum.Negative marking is a part of CAT. Aspirants are advised to not take wild guesses in the Exam paper. Only if the student is able to eliminate 2-3 choices, then he should take a guess. Otherwise there is no point in wild guessing, as it may drop ones chances of making it right.You must unwind before the exams. Over stressing can have negative impact on your output during the examination. Be your natural self and confident. Keep calm and cool. You must be aware of your examination centre before hand, all the documents, stationeries you need to produce at the centre should be kept handy so that trifle mismanagement may not unnerve you.Doing well in the CAT exam is the first step to ensuring that you get the education to build a great future. It involves a lot of hard work and is one of the most difficult competitive exams. But with right kind of focus and determination you are sure to be successful in cracking CAT.I hope you had a good read. All the best for your exams. If you need any further information on the same subject you can visit this blog , the url of which I am providing herewith.","The time to start preparations is now, get on to it right away. I cleared CAT 2013 and got into IIM Kozhikode and was working alongside while I was preparing. I’ll help you understand how I did and you can use it to similarly design your preparation schedule. This is how I was managing my weekdays-1. 5:30 AM: Up from Bed2. 6:00- 8:00/8:30 : CAT preparations3. 9:30-6:30 : Office4. 6:30-9:30: Relax and do miscellaneous things5. 10:00-10:45: Revise learnings from the morning hoursWeekendsSaturday: Answer MocksSunday: Review Mocks thoroughlyI would highly recommend you to setup a schedule for yourself and stick to it. Each day will help you build on your preparations.As you can see, I had a packed schedule and which kept me away from those long classroom coaching sessions. As an alternate source for preparation, I joined Handa ka Funda Online CAT Coaching Classes - MBA 2016 which is an online platform with no time constraints. It made me stick to my schedule and help me prepare really well.Having sorted out your schedule and also being enrolled in the online coaching , you need to emphasize on practising questions intensively. Please stress on those areas where you feel you need to improve. That’s the key to achieving that extra percentile at the top.Protip: While CAT concepts do have short cuts, success does not. The key is always hard work and practice.Do well !Tips for Working Guys: CAT is difficult to be managed with job but it has to be done (leaving a job for cat is too risky considering the unpredictability of the exam). Assumptions for below : 1. Total of 10-11 hours outside home (office + travel to/fro office) 2. Sat & Sun Weekend off In case any of the assumptions are not valid in your case, try to accommodate the points as per your schedule. 1. Give equal importance to all the 3 sections. Do not live under the veil that you can cover one section with another. It is difficult to do. Considering the unpredictability of VA and high difficulty level of DILR, focus on all the sections. 2. Daily news-paper reading (Hindu/Economic Times). 3. Daily VA practise from old mocks/sectionals. (IMS - all, Time - leave RCs, Cl - leave RCs) 4. Daily DILR practise from old mocks/sectionals. (IMS, CL, Time - all) 5. Daily QA practise from old mocks/sectionals. (IMS, CL, Time - all) 6. On weekdays allocate 6 hrs for studying (2 hrs for each section as told above) & on weekends9 hrs for studying (3 hrs to each section) and 3 hrs for mock and 2 hrs for mock analysis 7. Should finish QA theory and formulas by July/Aug. 8. From Aug/Sep onwards only revision and mocks and sectionals. 9. Should give atleast 2 mocks each weekend and their analysis. Should give all centre based mocks from centre itself to be prepared for all exam scenarios. 10. Last month (assuming Nov) : 1 mock each day and its analysis 11. Take an off atleast 1 week before the exam and give mocks at exam time. 12. Sneak in time for your hobbies during the preparation. Happy Prepping !! Don't overstress.

CAT,CAT or GMAT which one is tougher?,https://www.quora.com//CAT-or-GMAT-which-one-is-tougher,"Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",56,"Do you have domestic plans or international plans?Do you carry actual work experience?Can you spare your time for T.I.M.E?How do I score 750+ on GMAT?Ans: GMAT is super easy. You can take the GMAT exam max 5 times in 1 year. You can take each exam after every 16 days as per GMAC's new policy. I know it does take $250 (~Rs.16000) for each exam you take. Just remember that this exam is gonna decide your career and a very high GMAT score will fetch you a guaranteed 30%-50% scholarship as an international student. Top B-schools can track your record of each attempt you made to pick up the best score you earned. I'd suggest not more than 3 scored attempts and the score remains volatile for 3 years. Try to get at least 3 years of work experience (actually speaking, you need 5 years of Work Ex to become a very strong contender) and since you've got a lot of time, why not prepare from Day 1 instead? This is how a normal guy would think right? However, to prepare and crack a super competitive exam like GMAT there is no need for a tuition class and you don't need to prepare heavily for 3-5 years for this exam.You just need to subscribe for an online course (gmat.magoosh.com or gmatprepnow.com)and try to solve 40-50 Questions everyday for a period of 75 days for Math and Verbal lessons with 109 secs on stopwatch for each Qsn. Try 50 Qsns x 100 Secs = 5000 secs everyday's mental pressure i.e. 90 mins of mental football everyday for the next 75 days w/o half-time.Analyze your score.Improvize on the weak areas. It will take a month's time to refresh your Math and Verbal skills via tutorials.Plus, you do not want to waste and wait for 1 year for the CAT exam.GMAT is accepted in most B-Schools in India (even IIM-A/B/C/.......but only for top 1%-2% candidates).If you are currently pursuing your Bachelors degree i.e. if you are in 2nd or 3rd or 4th year engg., you must take a look at ISB's YLP program. Talk to the AdComs i.e. Admissions Committee for the median cut-off for undergrads. A score of 700 on GMAT would do the trick in Stage2.IIM-A/B/C median GMAT score is 750+ (but the FPM doctoral program has 680+ ->  48Q and 39V minimum for FPM admission i.e. >87th %ile).If you are an Indian, you must have at least 4 years of work ex and 730+ on GMAT for IIM-Bangalore (check this coz the competition here is too stiff).Go for EPGP and save your 1 year (-: It is a 720 hrs intensive program as against 960 hrs of its flagship PGP program.If you are an offshore candidate and did your MS abroad (>= 18 months program), you can send your GMAT score of 710+ for IIM-Bangalore (as of 2015) for 2 years PGP program (very good for networking).XLRI's median GMAT score is 680-690 i.e. >85th %ile.No shortcuts to XAT for BM via GMAT.If you have 2+ years of Work Ex, wait for 1 more year and aim for Global MBA  orIf you have 4+ years of Work ex, wait for 1 more year and go for GMP.Be ready with your GMAT score by 15th December for XLRI.ISB Hyderabad GMAT median score is 700+ i.e. >89th %ile.It is a 700 hrs intensive 1 year PGP program.Again, minimum 2 years of Work ex would suffice for ISB.(people generally have 4-5 yrs of work ex here.....So, if you have just 2-3 yrs of work ex, you need to earn a very high score on GMAT for sure).For ISB, be ready with your GMAT score by 15th October for Round1 or 15th Jan for Round2.If you are from Mumbai:SP Jain (650+)SJMSOM - IIT Bombay (700+)NMIMS (600+)Welinkar (600+).....All accept GMAT and will fetch you â‚¹.100k/month package for sure (-:but IIM Bangalore's package would be â‚¹.200k/month. So, rethink again!!!The beauty of GMAT is that you can mentally prepare yourself with 1 month's preparation and crack the exam with 700+ score. I'm talking about 150,000+  out of 1.29 million people cracking the 700+ score (equivalent to 89th percentile score) in the past 5 years:http://magoosh.com/gmat/2014/wha...Now, imagine if you want to crack the score of 700+ and hope for an admit to top 10 universities in USA, you'll have to go beyond 710-720 score to get a Wharton/MIT/Stanford/Yale call .....depends upon your MBA aspirations. Yes if you have a vast amount of Work ex, you can score low on GMAT i.e. 680-720.Remember, I said that it is much easier to study with your own pace and crack the GMAT in 2 months time and get a 750 score....every student competes with nearly 5000 applications in a university (Top15 B-schools) for getting an admission according to the specialization.....again depends.CAT needs 5-6 months of preparation (but you have to wait for 1 whole year for this exam) and if you aspire to have an IIM tag on your belt just to show the world that you are the Man, you can choose to give your CAT, get mentally set for the 99th percentile score and in the meantime you can easily give GMAT a try for 1 or 2 attempts :)Likewise, GMAT is awesome. Verbal has SC-CR-RC with 13-14/14-15/19-22 marks respectively. So, anyone who scores 13-14-19 on Verbal SC-CR-RC, will be on a high scorer bracket. Quant goes with 40% DS and 60% PS i.e. 15 and 22 Qsns approx. respectively. Math has no Graphs/Calendar/patterns logic/hard Functions....no Calculus and DI(except for 12 IR Qsns). It's purely logical.GMAT can be cracked with your own pace. CAT needs a lot of time. A lot of patience!GMAT Verbal will kill you for sure. But it gets more interesting when you try to solve a couple of hundred Qsns from each section :)There are 8 x 3 topics for Quant, SC and CR.See the pic below:â€‹So, there are around 30 topics in total that you need to master in 100 days right?For Quant, OG content + Magoosh + Manhattan is enough.If you are really really weak on the Verbal part, start with the foundations -Nautical Miles by IMSorWord Power Made Easy by Norman&LewisorManhattan MGMAT Foundations of Verbal book.You have tons of Apps in the App Store for pocket prep.Try these:Official GMAT app by gWhiz (in-built Timer + Reset button),Prep4 GMAT app by MIT guys (a very comprehensive app),Veritas Question Bank app (has 250 quiz qsns...50 for each),Complete GMAT Video Course app by Veritas prep,GMAT ToolKit 2 app for flash cards,Magoosh GMAT Math app, GMAT idioms app for flash cards,Pocket GMAT app by Manhattan for flashcards(For more flashcards, go to beatthegmat.com website),Pranayama app (for 5 mins mind yoga) andTimer+ app (stopwatch).The GMAT online forum community helps you a lot. Only 2 main active GMAT best forums in the market with over 10 years of expertise are gmatclub.com and beatthegmat.comDon't even think to go beyond that (-:So, log in and skim through the entire website rightaway.Become a silent observer of top main moderators (e.g. Bunuel and bb on gmatclub.com) and top members and followers on both the forums (-:Try to solve at least 10 mocks that are available for free for the 1st attempt (from Manhattan MGMAT, Veritas Prep, The Economist, Kaplan, 800score, Platinum GMAT, http://litesee.com/gmat.htm for verbal, Princeton Review, gmatclub.com and the actual GMATPrep s/w that includes 4 actual simulation tests of the GMAT exam ) and try to supplement it with an online course such as magoosh.com or gmatprepnow.com (hardly takes $99 for Magoosh and $0 for gmatprepnow).Buy the actual Quant Review and Verbal Review from GMAC.(buy it from amazon.in ;) save â‚¹300)Wiley, the publisher, provides you an online access to solve the same Qsns which allows you to simulate real GMAT exam mode online (-:Buy Question Pack1 from the mba.com (takes $30).Now, see the pic below:Total = around 3000 Qsns here.If you follow my chart shown below, you'll get your dream score for sure.Byheart this chart and solve these Qsns 2-3 times.Maintain your Error Log:GMAT Error Logs - Free Tools for your GMAT StudySo, say if you want to crack GMAT in 100 days, take out the entire column and divide it by 100 i.e. try to solve 6 DS 9 PS 5 SC 4 CR 1 RC passage per day. Try to go step by step. 1st complete Magoosh in 20-25 days and then touch the OG content and then touch your laptop with GMATPrep QsnPack1 practice. At this modest rate, you can easily cope up with 34-35 Qsns/day. Take rest on Sundays. This is really important. Don't budge. Complete the entire practice set and you'll feel confident enough to crack the mocks after 50 days for sure. Why 50 days? Remember, 3000+ Qsns are actually hidden in the mocks as well. So, double or triple your speed as per your capacity to digest that kind of data in your head. Keep that hunger and solve 20 mocks at least :)Don't forget to solve Manhattan MGMAT Qsns(I've not mentioned here in my chart) for SC and it really helps to crack the SC section if you could download ""Thursdays with Ron"" which is entirely for free (-:It has 50+ videos till date with more than 80+ hrs of online coaching content and get a high speed internet connection for downloading this 15 GB of awesome Verbal content or stream it as you wish:http://www.manhattanprep.com/gma... Do check this for consolidated files:http://gmatclub.com/forum/update...You don't need to go for an actual mentor coaching because the online part covers everything and the forums will help you solve your doubts quickly (-:These are 2 eBooks with 200 pgs of awesome content that you must read: SC Tips eBook from Prep4GMAT by MIT guys (-:SC eBook from Magoosh's blog for idioms (-:Even if you are not satisfied with your official CR content and are really hungry for more, go for Powerscore CR bible, Powerscore RC and the Official LSAT SuperPrep......You'll have to dedicate another 100 days to cover this entire topic (2000+ Qsns) if you are weak in CR or RC. Actually speaking, you need to really do the OG content and feel each CR Qsn thoroughly. For RC, you'll have to improve your english skills if you are a non-native. This means that you'll need to read NYT/The Economist/ The Hindu or play with fiction novels. You do realize that these great authors and highly paid writers have strong vocab skills embedded with years of practice and perfection....I am Marathi. I sucked at verbal with 30-34 initially. And I have read 570+ novels and 10,000s of articles. So, daily I journalize my stuff. Keep this habit and you'll understand how I could crack GMAT in 72 days. It is not by magic. You need to hone your logical reasoning skills.For RC- Don't be bleakly emotional with the cognitive content. If you keep on doing the same RC passages or skim it twice or thrice then you are certainly weak on RC. Familiarity breeds contempt!! But stay focussed for at least 100 days and you can crack your Verbal with a perfect 43/44/45 (-: You know, you don't need a TOEFL score if you have a strong Verbal score on GMAT (-: But give it anyway coz you need to convince your Visa interviewer to make him/her happy.For those who are struggling with Verbal and want to catapult your score, invest in e-GMAT subscription for $199. I never tried it but my friends told me it is cool for a non native.Would suggest T.I.M.E for CAT for sure ....no doubt about that!Full-time faculty members @T.I.M.E are really naive to not to give GMAT and  guess what, GMAT Math is 3 times easier than what I experienced from CAT but GMAT Verbal is 3 times difficult.......nobody might have told you that right (-:Also, nobody might have whispered this to you:GMAT calculates past 3 years percentile scores i.e. close to 22 Lakh scores.CAT just calculates current year percentile scores i.e. close to 2 Lakh scores.http://www.mba.com/india/the-gma...(For example, Yale SOM last year's admission was for 710-720. Now, because so many took the GMAT and many scored beyond 720, the median cut-off for Yale is now 720+ as of 2015 which was 710+ as of 2014!!!)More than 1.29 million people took the GMAT exam in the past 5 years and more than 3.72 million score reports were sent.So, %ile scores are really hard to earn these days.A GMAT score of 750 used to be 99th %ile score in 2005,Now, 750 is considered as 98th %ile score in 2015.That's okay!! You don't need a 750 score. You just need to get beyond 720....Q50,V40 will easily fetch you a Top10 B-school call :)So, if you are intelligent enough to decide for yourself, you might say both exams are super tough.GMAT focusses mainly on Verbal and CAT focusses mainly on Math.For those who really don't understand:AWA (nothing but an argument's analysis = 30 mins)+ IR(hard mix of 12 Qsns i.e. 33-39 sub-Qsns from Quant+Verbal = 30 mins) + Quant (37 Qsns = 75 mins)+ Verbal(41 Qsns = 75 mins)= GMAT :)AWA can be done in 1 session :) Easiest section on GMATHow to get 6.0 AWA....my guide... byheart the template a million times.IR needs crazy reasoning skills.Quant is easy.Verbal can chew up your score into pieces...!!!The exam is for 3.5 hrs. So, visualize your cockpit (-:Keep 10 days reserved for taking mocks prior to your GMAT exam (-:If you are a novice beginner, I'd say 100 days to GMAT or 200 days to CAT.If you are an intermediate, I'd say 75 days to GMAT or 150 days to CAT.If you are an expert, I'd say 60 days to GMAT or 120 days to CAT.In conclusion, if you can crack GMAT with 760, with an extra effort on the Math, you can easily crack CAT with 99.99%ile.My Total Cost for GMAT : approx. Rs.36000 /- (buy books from amazon.in itself, it is actually cheaper than flipkart ;))1. GMAC's Official Guide with 900 Qsns for Rs. 11002. GMAC's Quant Review and Verbal Review books with 600 Qsns for Rs.15003. GMAC's Study collection for Rs.4600 (QsnPack1 with 500 Qsns and ExamPack1 with 4 genuine mocks = $72) from mba.com....You have to practice this on laptop/PC.4. gmat.magoosh.com with 900+ Qsns takes Rs. 6300 ($99 premium purchase) and includes 1 mock test.5. Manhattan MGMAT books for Rs. 3200 (only SC/CR/RC) with online access to 6 hard mocks. Also, buy Foundations of MGMAT Verbal and Advanced GMAT Quant = Rs.2000.6. GMAT exam fee is  $250 i.e. Rs.16,300.Plus, I borrowed the Powerscore CR Bible, Powerscore RC and Official LSAT Superprep from my mentor. So, I saved ~6000 bucks (-:Note : Schedule your exam date 2 months prior to your GMAT.Well yes, if you happen to stumble upon GRE, you can download ETS.org's free Powerprep s/w and you can check which exam is better by simulating both the GMATPrep s/w and PowerPrep test s/w......each has 2 mocks for free (-:Tip -> Judge both the exams after studying at least for 1 month prior to taking any simulation test.Both exams are accepted by MBA programs as well.Mostly for Masters/PhD, you take the GRE exam.Mostly for B-schools for MBA (or a relevant PhD), you take the GMAT exam.What is the GMAT equivalent GRE score?Check this:http://www.ets.org/s/gre/flash/b...GMAT Total score = -2080.75 + 6.38*GRE Verbal Reasoning score + 10.62*GRE Quantitative Reasoning scoreThe regression equations:GMAT Verbal score = -109.49 + 0.912*GRE Verbal Reasoning scoreGMAT Quantitative score = -158.42 + 1.243*GRE Quantitative Reasoning scoreSo, V164 minimum on GRE = V40 on GMATand Q168 minimum on GRE = Q50 on GMAT.So, a GRE score of 333 = GMAT score of 750+..'. GRE score of 327 = GMAT score of 700.Note: If you want to send your score for Top10 B-schools, try to get 330+ on GRE.Top B-schools won't tolerate your score after your 3 scored attempts on GMAT and if you've failed to get a good score on GMAT even after 3 scored attempts, I'd say switch to GRE if you are really in a hurry bcoz application deadlines are near and you've exhausted your 3 scored attempts on GMAT already (coz you know each scored attempt can be tracked by Top B-schools).ETS and GMAC are two separate entities now (-:The world is full of possibilities (-:Tips :Try ginger soup coz it raises your heartbeat (-:2 months leave  from  Work/Job (very important step to stay in focus for modus operandi)Now, try to take 10 days out and just auto-play all 300+ video lessons from Magoosh. Quant has some 180 video lessons and Verbal has some 125 video lessons. During these 10 days, don't practice any questions. Just enjoy the content. I completed the entire video lessons in 6 days and I re-played it again and again till I felt confident. Now solve 512 Quant questions and 425 Verbal questions separately. My entire time on Magoosh's website was 31 hrs. Why 31 hrs? bcoz I solved it thrice. All 900+ Qsns and diagnostic test as well. I just loved the Dashboard concept and Customize your practice filters.Solve OG 10th edition 1st and then solve the OG latest edition.People are really naive and don't know how to navigate a forum.

Put 1min 49 secs for all SC/CR/DS/PS Questions and 2-3 mins for the RC passages (90 secs for SC .....to save time for CR and RC during the real exam and 2-3 mins per IR Qsn).Observe the moderators here. Bunuel's posts on gmatclub.com for his ""signature collections"" especially for Quant practice serves best. You'll get another surprise attack of 1000+ Quant Qsns here :-)Do not throw any topic for option!! (as we used to do in our college days..!!!!)Have a self disciplined approach and do not corrupt your mind by watching tons of movies or TV series. Remember that GMAT is a matter of 100 days of study....thats it!!Hydrate your body well. Sleep for at least 8-9 hrs daily for the next 2 months followed by a short nap. REM sleep can do wonders (-:Finally, motivate yourself by comparing B-schools on mba .com's awesome School Finder Tool. Jot down the application deadlines of your dream B-schools and be prepared with LORs, SOPs and Essays for each B-school. Normally people apply in Round 1 and Round 2.For Round 1, be ready by end of August because at least 30%-40% seats are reserved for the 1st pool of applications. For Round 2, be ready with your score by end of December because your GMAT median score might not be upto mark and you really needed some more time. So, for getting an admission abroad, do your research 18 months well in advance :)Never ever apply in Round 3 because seats are already filled up. Hardly 5%-10% seats will be available and tons of people will fight for the same. So, better clock for Round 1 after few months :)I was shitting my pants after I scored 390 570 680 720 on the simulation mocks from GMATPrep s/w !!!...All you need to do is to be technically sound with the GMAT format....The way GMAT tests you and the way you need to test the GMAT (-:OG 10th Edition contains 441 Quant PS Qsns(136 are new), 274 DS Qsns (124 are new) and Verbal (SC-268 + CR-205 + RC-50+ Passages) 700+ Qsns.Get your Manhattan's MGMAT 10 study guides (or only verbal).I've never touched Nova or Kaplan or Barrons or etc. shit!!Every person will tell you a very different story on their roadmap to ace GMAT.....that is what you have to judge for yourself!!Some people will kiss Veritas prep, some will go for Economist Tutor (â‚¹.30k), some will go to youtube to crash their minds and some minds will crash and stick to Youtube playlists.....my sincere suggestion to you is: research more or stick to what I've said :)A bit more advice: Don't join T.I.M.E. or Byju's or Jamboree or Manhattan/Veritas classroom tutoring. These people will tell you what you already know. You just need cool resources and materials and proper time management which I've already discussed with you. Streamline your goals.So, you know for sure that with OG 10th edn, you can easily add 1000 Qsns to the Chart + 3000 Qsns from Mocks (1687 Qsns pool from GMATPrep s/w) + 1000s of extra Qsns from Manhattan + 3000 Qsns from my chart!!So, in all, you'll have to solve nearly 7500+ Qsns to get 750+ on GMAT and do not forget to solve it 2-3 times!!I should write a book on this thingy coz I've cracked it with a 750 score on the GMAT with 72 days of preparation. That is okay as compared to CAT with 140 days of preparation (again depends on your pace and patience).Just 10 weeks of hard work (unlike 20 weeks for CAT)!! I never tried Veritas prep's 6 mocks for $49 or gmatclub .com's 31 tests for $80.You don't need all of that to saturate your head.Even if you buy only 1 Manhattan MGMAT book (say SC) for Rs.1000, you can get an online access to all 6 hard mocks that will be valid for 1 year.Well some last tips:1. AWA score >= 5 and IR score >= 5 .....for Top10 B-schools.2. According to GMAC's new policy, you can cancel your GMAT score report if you think you have performed very badly during the test and you won't have to face the same Qsn on the day of your interview with the top B-school. This also means that if you are determined to crack GMAT in 1 year, you can give this exam and cancel the score 4 times and the B-schools won't notice anything. Well, trust me. You don't need that kind of attempts. At least, you can play the game for the 5th time ;)3. Also, since you know that GMAT is an adaptive test, you must be super alert and focussed to solve the 1st 10 Qsns on GMAT Quant section and the 1st 10 Qsns on GMAT Verbal section correctly during the test. If your initial Qsns are correct and you get 4-5 Qsns wrong at the end of Quant section and 4-5 Qsns wrong at the end of Verbal section, it really doesn't matter. You'll still score 700+ on GMAT.4. Carry a 100gms glucose biscuit and 1 fruit and 1 litre juice/water with you at the time of your GMAT exam and do not forget to wear a sweater because you'll be giving the exam @24Â° C for nearly 226 mins (You'll be given 8 mins break after 1 hour of AWA+IR and 8 mins break after Quant section). At the end of your exam, the GMAC portal will ask you whether you want to keep your score.... So, make this as a #1 thumb rule: Cancel your score report blindly if you don't get a 700+ score on the day of your GMAT exam!! Trust me, this will not only make your heart feel stronger but it will also make you feel more powerful the next time you hit the exam center.Some things I have not told you yet:5000 secs for everyday practice also means that you should give 10000 more secs to review the same (-:I did my entire practice on iPad coz it's sleek. Except for the Study Collection i.e. QsnPack 1 + ExamPack 1 which I did on my laptop.I personally made it sure that I completed at least 70 Qsns as per day's target.My max was 120. So, if you cannot keep up with your pace, you cannot rest on Sundays that is for sure. And I also confess the fact I sequestered myself in my room for 2 long months :-* It chafed me to be confined like this....but ultimately it paid off at the end!!Download ""GoodReader"" app. Now, download previous OG 12th Edition or 13th Edition in PDF format. Now, create an annotated copy and use Highlighter so that you can track your page by page progress and bookmark that page daily.Say, your MGMAT CAT's 6 mocks avg. score = 670 or 680. Well, actually you'll easily get 720-730 score on the real GMAT exam.If you score 710 on the GMATPrep s/w, your actual score on the GMAT will be +10 or -10 i.e. 700 or 720. This software is really precise.In total you'll have 20 mocks: 4 GMATPrep s/w + 6 MGMAT CATs + 10 Free mocks that I mentioned earlier. So, just focus on your Qs and Vs.e.g. IIMs want 49/50/51 on Quant and 43/44/45 on Verbal.For IIMs, you can keep your GMAT score for 2 years (in case you are busy with your international client or you decide to start working on your Startup idea before joining an IIM).And do not hesitate to give your GMAT for a 2nd or 3rd attempt.You know, some B-schools will easily give you a 100% scholarship.Read this:http://blogs.economictimes.india... ....This girl from India got $80000 scholarship and was cordially invited by Cox B-school in the USA.So, just imagine her total MBA financial outlay for subsistence would be very nominal for 2 years including Living/Rent/Utilities/Health insurance/etc....and this is the reason mostly Indian students opt for GMAT for abroad generous scholarships from B-schools.For Canada, Top 5 B-schools have GMAT score requirement of 650-700 only. So, if you score low on GMAT, don't destroy your hopes :) You can still immigrate to Canada in 3 short years :)OrIf your budget is really low i.e. ~$50k, I'd suggest go for MS in MIS only if you are a curious CS grad interested for a career in management in IT in USA or abroad elsewhere (you can work as a Software developer or in Operations or Analyst or etc. with a degree in MIS). MIS mainly requires a GMAT score and it becomes affordable to choose a cool university for the same coz you also know that most MIS programs are STEM related and will give you 2.5 years on OPT (unlike 12 months OPT for MBA). Here, you can save upto â‚¹.5 Lakhs on internship and literally complete your higher education under â‚¹.20 Lakhs abroad if you get a TA/RA i.e. Teaching Assistantship/Research Assistantship (So, shed a good conduct on your Professor and publish a research paper on your topic of specialization before you write your essays for admission).OrGo for a affordable Masters program in the USA (that requires a GMAT score) and after OPT if you find yourself lucky to win a H-1B cap/lottery, you can ask your Employer to fund your Part-time i.e. Weekend MBA program while you are still working on H-1B visa :) Your GMAT score will be still valid and you must use the score for a 2nd time for your MBA. So, tracing your timeline is really essential for this to happen. Alternate way: On OPT you can easily save upto $50k. So, all you need is another $50k. This $50k can be waived with scholarship via high GMAT score. A part-time MBA will take 3 years for completion. It is the same MBA degree (like a traditional/Full-time degree) but this time you won't have to worry about any loan/co-applicant or your Dad's help (-: and the best part is that you'll earn & learn at the same time.OrIf you are a stereotypical engineer or someone who is currently in the pre-final year of your graduation and you have zero Work Ex but if you have a stellar profile, go for Deferred admission: HBS 2+2/ Yale Silver Scholars program/ Stanford GSB deferred enrollment/ Chicago Booth Scholars program/ ISB Young Leaders Program/ IESE Young Talents program/etc. A high GMAT score would certainly increase your chances. What is this program about? It is the same MBA degree but you get to enroll in the 1st year directly after your undergraduate degree. For the next 2 years you'll have to work and in this way, you not only get B-school approved skillset but you also get a guarantee to comeback quickly after 2 years of Work Ex to complete your MBA (In short, if you ask me, you save your 2-3 years of your life since your competition will be with guys with minimum 4-5 years of work ex and you'll stand out to be the best candidate engaged with proper skills when you enter the 2nd year of the MBA program after 3 years).OrIf you've only completed your Bachelors degree, you can directly get into a fully funded PhD program (without the need for a Masters degree) from a reputed University anywhere in the world. A high score on GMAT would be required. So, here's another reason why you would like to spend 5+ years on a research to get an experience with a cool stipend. Why PhD? Coz you can self-petition for your EB2 visa (with tons of research papers) and you can also ask 3-4 employers to petition your H-1B visa in the USA. So, people who really know this directly apply for a doctoral program without giving it a 2nd thought (research more to get a mentor for your R&D in your specialization).For those looking for a Top B-school abroad and need a funding without a collateral/co-signer, just take a loan from Prodigy Finance: http://prodigyfinance.com to pay your entire MBA fees with a cool EMI over a period of 10 years. Hats off to this community initiated by INSEAD+LBS guys :)See, just motivate yourself with such articles and try to get 100% scholarship.Remember, 111-117 Qsns is what will decide your fate on GMAT :)The more you rely on unofficial content, the more you will become vulnerable to a bad score. Magoosh is just for brushing up your skills via tons of tutorials and practice Qsns. And finally, just trust Manhattan blindly bcoz I say so :)And because of the new GMAC's policy, what used to be 89th %ile score i.e. 700 on GMAT...would be 85th %ile in no time. So, quickly register to give the GMAT and keep a 100 days target :) and don't waste your precious time to join any stupid coaching classes....they will mess up your head even more!!!and let's say if at all you need Tuition coaching = 30k goneand let's say you are poor in verbal....e-gmat = 13k goneFor practice.....Magoosh = 6.5k goneFor learning....Manhattan MGMAT Study Guides = 10.5k goneFor official content.....Official Guides + Study Collection = 7k goneFor mocks....let's say you picked gmatclub.com's 33 mock Tests = 5k goneand let's assume you gave the GMAT exam thrice = 50k gone.'. Total = 125k gone.See, it becomes very expensive.Don't bother.Just keep an eye on your golden ticket to B-school via 100% scholarship, which can be upto $80k or about â‚¹.50 Lakhs. That's massive and generous!!Think of it (â‚¹.125k) as an investment in your future.Think of it as the last resort to spearhead your career.What you need is a high level fidelity to Math and English.So, be a lone wolf and try to be as fresh as a duke while studying ;-)Below is a GMAC research data report of past 10 years:Google: ""World Geographic Trend Report for GMAT Examinees""I've saved your efforts....check this:3.72 million Score reports Ã· 1.29 million students = avg 2.8 times!!.'. Each examinee attempts for a 2nd or 3rd time after taking the GMAT exam to earn a very high score to secure an admit to his/her dream B-school....as per new GMAC's policy, you can take the GMAT 5 times in 1 year.Can you do that for CAT in 1 year???Do you have the flexibility such as Round 1 or Round 2 application deadlines for top B-schools in India via CAT??Do you really want to get a -ve score after you hit a wrong option(CAT)??Can you build your accuracy for the non-MCQs with at least 75 marks(25 Qsns) on CAT with exactly 150 secs per Qsn in your hand??Can you beg for a cool scholarship (>=50%) with your CAT score?Plus, can you keep CAT score for at least 2-3 years??You have to actually wait for 1 whole year to take the CAT exam!!Then you start thinking 1st 6 months rest & then next 6 months CAT prep.Lol.....So, people who are lucky to read this post, dedicate 1st 6 months to crack GMAT. Next 6 months to CAT :)Remember, >95th %ile score (>720) for GMAT and >99th %ile score (>200) for CAT :)Here's a GMAT score chart. If you are aspiring for top B-schools, I'd say paste this chart above your head where you sleep and just dream about this triangle for the next 100 days (-: Your eyes should target V40 and Q50 (at the minimum).â€‹GMAT wiki search result:The GMAT does not measure business knowledge or skill, nor does it measure intelligence. According to the test owning company, the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving abilities, while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success.Coming to CAT:Didn't look at NCERT Std 6th to Std 12th books.Didn't do Arun Sharma a favor.Had no time at all for T.I.M.E. coaching (coz I was working) nor I wanted to get crammed with 40 people in a room which is supposed to be a room for a batch of 30 people.Have a really great shortcut to crack CAT....Career Launcher has Test series.Enroll with CAT TS+TG (Test Series + Test Gym) product:http://www.clexams.com/You have to shell off â‚¹.4000 for the same.Now, you must get hooked to CLexams.com portal for at least 100 days.It had cost me an entire day to figure out how the fuck should I approach to crack 8500 Qsns.So, made a really cool chart yet again:â€‹Tests pe Tests....Turns out Test Gym has 741 Tests in total.Test Gym Lite has:276 Tests for Quant.100 Tests for DI/LR.365 Tests for Verbal.31 full-length mocks and 45 sectional tests + 24 more from Test Gym Classic.Keep last 15 days for mocks. Again, go step by step. Complete 10-12 tests per day. Bookmark those hard ones.For pocket prep....download the MBA Exams Guide app from the Playstore.1 Test = 7 Qsns..'. 10-12 Tests = 70-84 Qsns per day's target.So, don't be gobsmacked coz it takes ~15 mins to solve a single Test.Again, don't forget to reset everything and solve it twice and thrice.Do the above and you'll get 99.99 %ile for sure.I made this decision coz I already gave the GMAT and I was strong with my Verbal and Math skills and most importantly, I was mentally set for solving those 8500 Qsns.And don't worry about getting a 99 %ile in your CL mocks.CL mocks are much tougher than the actual CAT exam.All Qsns are neatly refined to ace your CAT exam.So, even if you get 85-90 %ile in the CL mocks that would easily culminate into a 99th %ile score on the day of your CAT exam :-)So, be happy that you can actually ace the CAT in just 4000 bucks.Okay, I exaggerated a bit. You need â‚¹.2000 to buy Arun Sharma books.And download NCERT books too :)Do remember this: CAT will hit you with minimum 25 non-MCQs. Also, the concept of LR on CAT is pretty hard and you won't get enough time to solve 12 Qsns on LR. So practice real hard.(So, if you could get 15 Qsns correct in each section i.e. VA, DI/LR & QA you'd end up with a 90th %ile score on CAT. But if you can score 22-23 Qsns correctly in each section, you'd get a 99th %ile score....that's my analysis).Warning: Don't skip NCERT and Arun Sharma books if you have not given the GMAT exam 1st and you just wanna give the CAT exam 1st coz you'll have to dedicate 1st 30 days refreshing your skills for CAT Math itself. This is something not to be trifled with leniently. So, slap yourself and re-read my entire post again.Your head will be completely packed with 15000+ Qsns after GMAT and CAT.So, don't play all the cards at once (-:Remember, you still have a full marathon race before you :) From a monetary point of view, if you observe, only 12%-15% people giving CAT can afford to take the GMAT (or there are tons of other reasons for taking CAT.....job/support family/business....for execs/career in India/limited H-1B visas in USA/short OPT period of only 1 year for MBA guys in USA/cannot afford to sacrifice 6-7 years to repay $400k debt to Prodigy Finance if you have a H-1B visa/cannot afford to sacrifice 11-12 long years to repay $400k debt to Prodigy Finance in Indian currency/etc.).Advice on B-school debt by Warren Buffett:GMAT or CAT is not about a formidable challenge. It is about the ability to endure hardship against your sedentary ass!!And before you enter this mad quest just be sure to get at least 20+ genuine verified certifications (e.g. Business Informatics/Venture Finance/Statistics/Entrepreneurship/Innovation/Analytics/Accounting/Leadership/Digital Planning/Marketing/Finance/Strategy/Management/Economics/Operations/Critical Thinking/Creative Writing/Public Speaking/etc.) from Coursera :) to be well ahead of the competition to not to show empathy after a ""failed Startup"" situation in your essays. Trust me, it works even with Harvard ;-)And why I've emphasized on Top10 B-schools?It's an axiom of marketing: Reputation matters!!!And why did I give both the exams?It will take me 3000 more words to write exclusively and prove it to you ""Why not both the exams??"".So, anticipate your death after 25,000 days and just take out 250 days to crack GMAT and CAT.Chao*Best of Luck (-:+1Kudos=Thanks (-:","There is no competition between these two.How can you compare a Hayabusa and a Harley Davidson bike, both are made for different approaches.Similarly a Gmat exam and a Cat exam requires different set skills like-GMAT has an easier quant than Cat.Cat requires you to have a top notch academic background.A coaching institute of CAT in India will require you to study for various other exams conducted by private b-schools to which makes your study harder and this takes 12â€“15 months of studies.The % of people in India taking GMAT exam are times less than people appearing for Cat.The above point makes the Cat exam tougher as you need to top among the toppers for your entry in top Indian B-schools.But the story does not end here because a CAT exam may be tougher on paper but GMAT takes the toughness to another level.CAT has a nominal fees of 2,000 approx but if you are not a general category your exam will be done within 1,000/- Rupees only. On the other hand GMAT exam will tear you savings if you are not financially strong i.e it requires a sum of 16,000 rupees for one exam (if you want to give it 5 times in a year be ready to starve)The CAT exam is conducted by Indian Authorities only in and for India but a caste category person can beat you up with lower score in CAT if you belong to General category. This reservation do not exists in GMAT making it much of a true potential exam.CAT exam is tougher than a GMAT exam but do you know what you have to go through after getting a great score in both.For CAT you have to face an interview in that applied top B-school and if everything goes right then you are in.While GMAT topper has to start his 3â€“4 year journey until they apply to the top B-school. This requires you to have a job experience, good social background, extra curricular enthusiast, an enhanced leadership skill and at last top notch English communication. (This is why GMAT scores are kept valid for 5 years.This is because the foreign schools prefer practical skills than a theoretical knowledge which i thinks India lags somewhere.And last but not the least the expense in foreign colleges is much more than any other college in INDIA. So if you can work hard continuously for at least 5 years then go for it you will definitely get admitted with wavier and scholarships.","The Graduate Management Admission Test, popularly known as GMAT is probably the most important exam that can help you to get into the best MBA schools across the world. Beginning in 1953, GMAT is conducted by the Graduate Management Admission Council. The scores are accepted by over 2100 schools worldwide and for 5900 programs.Needless to say, this exam is one of the important steps that will help you to get into your chosen B-School. Though the GMAT exam is not the only factor for getting admission in the B-Schools, a good enough GMAT score makes the rest of the admission procedure incredibly easy.The GMAT exam is conducted at regular intervals all over the world and essentially contains four sections â€“ the analytical writing assessment (AWA), Integrated Reasoning, Quantitative and Verbal. The total duration of the test is three and a half hours and one score anything between 200 and 800.Like any other examination, the GMAT has its own challenges. It is one of the toughest MBA entrance tests and the very fact that it gives you access to the Top 10 colleges across the world shows its reach. The best part about GMAT is the fact that it is conducted multiple times in a year and hence a student can decide to take the test anytime depending on when they feel their preparation is up to the mark, unlike most Indian MBA entrance tests.Here are 5 tips on how to up your GMAT game.1. Fix the Test Date after you start preparingThe tendency for students irrespective of which part of the world they belong to is to keep the exam preparations for the last moment. But serious test takers will start preparing long in advance. For the lazy test taker, we suggest that you start preparing first and then later decide the date when you will take the test. If after three months of preparation you feel confident enough to take the test, sign up for the nearest test date. This way you will not wait for the last moment to start preparing. The larger aim of the test preparation comes into play here. Instead of preparing because you have to take the test, you prepare first and then decide to take the test.2. Study continuously, not sporadicallyLike most tests that assess your understanding of a variety of subject matters, you need to be in constant touch with the study material for GMAT as well. It does not help if you start studying mid way and then decide to resume after a weekâ€™s gap. This not only breaks the continuity of your preparation but also makes you forget valuable concepts and techniques. Thus being continuously in touch with your test preparation is needed. A one or two day break is acceptable, but anything longer would only bring down your level of preparation.3. Take a GMAT prep test to see where you standThe GMAT website offers two free prep tests that all test takers can avail. The best way to assess where you stand before you start preparing is to take one of these tests and see the scores and compare them against what you aim to achieve. They give a fair understanding of your current aptitude in GMAT and which ones are your problem areas. The only hazard with these free prep tests is that they are not adapted to empirical, standardized test results and can possibly give you a different understanding of your position. You can also always take the tests available on Princeton, Kaplan, Manhattan etc. and then use a GMAT Score Estimator/Calculator to find your real GMAT equivalent. Once you have started preparing, take as many prep tests as you can because only then can you gauge your own progress. Use your first score as the lowest limit and set a target score. If you prepare right, all the tests that you take must only point towards you reaching the target score.4. Discover your weakness and work on itEvery test taker has their weakness. Some are strong in quant but finds the verbal section problematic. On the other hand, someone may be very strong in verbal but quant is where they require some serious practice. Most people go for coaching classes but since most of these classes focus on both on Quant and Verbal, a person who is strong in one of these benefits from only half the material provided. It is, therefore, preferable to go for one-on-one coaching or study through an online course. It not only helps you to get individual and undivided attention but also allows you to choose what exactly you want to study depending on your need.5. Decide your own time milestonesThe nightmare of every test taker is not being able to finish a test. As children, all of us have had those dreams of time running out and our exam papers being blank. With a time-sensitive test like GMAT, it is quite possible that you might run out of time causing you to take random guesses that would do you more bad than good. The cleverest thing to do here is to see how much time each question will take and then set milestones that you need to achieve. For example, in the quant section, you must reach the seventh question with 60 minutes remaining and the fifteenth question with 45 minutes remaining on the clock. This way if you see you are falling behind early enough, you can speed up and finish the section smoothly.The key to getting a good GMAT score is knowing the right techniques and having the right amount of practice along with good time management skills. This test truly prepares you for the challenges of management career!All the best!Some useful resources:GMAT Prep: Critical Reasoning DecodedB-School Admission: Written Ability Test (WAT) and Personal Interview (PI)","GMAT & CAT have the same syllabus, both deal with Mathematics and English. Both tests complement each other. Preparing for GMAT helps CAT aspirants in verbal, and CAT preparation helps GMAT aspirants in Quantitative Section. Most of the sections in both the tests are common.MBA admission is a steep road. It's important to keep all doors open. It's good to be confident, but there is a thin line difference between confidence and over-confidence. CAT success rate (% of students getting admission in good colleges) is meager. GMAT, on the other hand, opens doors for almost all the global and Indian business schools.One more misconception about GMAT is that it's only for rich. A Business school is not ""Global"" if it does not keep ""Currency Disparity"" in their mind. That's why they offer scholarships to aspirants from lower-valued currency countries. Almost all the Indian students end up getting scholarships to study abroad.Note for Graduation Final Year Students:Business schools accepting GMAT scores need at least 2+ Years work experience. But then also it makes more sense to give GMAT with CAT. The first reason is GMAT score is valid for five years.Secondly, It's much better to have a GMAT score before selecting business schools. It gives time to aspirants to work on their needed profile.Thirdly, Taking out study time is much easier in student life compared to that in job times. Most of the working applicants find it very difficult to take time out for studies.Lastly, CAT success rate is meager compared to GMAT. Till your overall %ile is touching 99, you are not a serious candidate for IIM-A, B & C. And if your %ile is lower than 98%, you have to go for tier-2 B-schools only.GMAT & CAT Section-wise Analysis:Verbal Section  Sentence Correction: Both exams require candidates to spot grammatical errors. There is one manageable difference. GMAT SC is based on American English while CAT SC is based on British English.   Reading Comprehension: The passages in the CAT and GMAT are almost equally cryptic. RC in GMAT is more difficult than that in CAT.  Critical Reasoning: GMAT CR is tougher than CAT CR. If you are prepared for GMAT CR, then CAT CR is a cakewalk.Quantitative SectionCAT preparation will make GMAT Quant a kid's play. The good news is that many CAT topics such as logarithms, trigonometry, calendars, clocks, shares, etc are not tested in GMAT.Analytical writing assessmentGMAT tests your clarity of thinking in this section. It looks for content, the organization of thought process, language skills and writing mechanisms in evaluating the essays. The good news is that the AWA is not a tough section to ace.Visit www.EduShastra.com for more details."
CAT,What are the recommended books/materials for the CAT exam preparation?,https://www.quora.com//What-are-the-recommended-books-materials-for-the-CAT-exam-preparation,"NMAT Preparation, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Book Recommendations",100+,"One of the things that I have seen a lot of CAT aspirants worry about is the books related to CAT preparation. Probably it is natural to get worried about important things in life and CAT preparation is definitely one of the important steps in anyone’s career. Having said that, the choice of books is probably not an important one.There are plenty of great books that are available in the market that you can use and there is very little that separates them. First of all, if you are looking at understanding and application I would much rather recommend that you go ahead with an online coaching course for CAT. It would offer you a lot more than what any book can with the help of videos and live classes for doubt clarification.Having said that, it is also necessary to have some material or the other so that you can practice and eventually improve yourself to solve CAT level questions easily.To be honest, I would recommend that you try out the study material from IMS / TIME / Career Launcher as your first resource. This material is very well designed and keeps the needs of students as the first priority. The slight problem that exists with TIME material, in my opinion, is that sometimes it tends to be a little bit harder than required.You can easily skip out on that particular part of the chapter or those set of problems. However, you should have the knack of knowing what is relevant from a CAT perspective. Once you go through enough number of previous year CAT questions – you will develop that knack. In case you get a doubt regarding the same, you can obviously ask around in some forum. A basic thumb rule could be – can this question be solved from the concepts that you learn in class 10th? If yes – then it is probably relevant for CAT, otherwise, it is not.If it is a Logical Reasoning or Data Interpretation question that is really hard and you look at the solution and it gives you feeling empty headed – there is a very low chance of it getting asked in CAT. Even if it gets asked in CAT, there is a very low chance of most CAT aspirants, including you, solving it during the exam pressure. It is best to learn what to skip during your CAT preparation phase so that you can do it in the main exam as well.Books to avoid for CAT PreparationAs far as books are concerned, let me start with a few books that I do not think are very useful from a CAT preparation perspective.Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis – A brilliant book for building your Vocabulary. This book is probably the best possible way to develop a good vocabulary. The problem, however, with this book is that it is voluminous and bulky. Rarely have I come across a CAT aspirant who has been able to stick to this book for over a month. They start it with full gusto but give up on it in the middle. If building vocabulary is your focus, using some mobile apps is a good idea. The best possible “realistic” way to build a good vocabulary is to read books. Here is a list of recommended books for CAT aspirants.How to Read Better and Faster by Norman Lewis – Once again, a really good book. It is more of a workbook and has a bunch of exercises that can help you improve your reading speed. But perhaps – that is not something that you need. If you have a good reading speed, it helps. But probably it should not be your priority. The length of CAT passages has ranged from 400 words to 1000 words in the past decade. You can also say that it is anywhere from 150-250 words per question.Questions in CAT have rarely been so simple that if you speed-read the passage, you will be able to answer them. You might not need a deep level understanding of the passage but a superficial glance is not going to help you either. You might improve a little bit if you go through the exercises mentioned in the book but I would still recommend that you improve your reading habits rather than improving your reading speed.NCERT Books – I have been guilty of recommending the same to a few students who struggle with the basics of a particular topic. Over time I have realised why this recommendation does not work. The reason is not that these books focus on the wrong concepts. The reason is that they are not required. If you as a student are unable to understand a particular concept, it is not because of the book you are using but it is because you are not able to understand what is given in the book. Probably you need someone to explain it to you. You need someone who can clarify your doubts. The book is not at fault here – you are! I am sorry if this sounds rude. You should stick to your CAT books and study material.High School English Grammar and Composition by Wren and Martin – It is a great book but as the name suggests, you should have read it in high school. The importance of Grammar, sadly, has reduced over the years in CAT. Even earlier, CAT did not mean to test if you knew the definition of a gerund or how it is different from an infinitive. The objective always was to check if you were able to identify the correct sentence or not. Having said that, if you have a good command of English grammar – it will help you in the later stages of Group Discussion and Personal Interview. Most good Business Schools have a ‘Written Ability Test’ to assess your communication skills. Bad grammar at that stage can be a real problem. Once again, reading books (not by Chetan Bhagat) is probably a good way to improve in that area. It would be great if you start blogging. If you write a blog post a week, you would find a remarkable improvement in your grammar in a short time. Learning the rules from Wren and Martin will help you become a good English teacher but I guess that is not what you are aiming for.Some of the books that I think can help you with CAT Preparation are given below. Let me add, you should use these provided you cannot arrange for IMS / TIME / Career Launcher material from somewhere.Books by TMH – Arun SharmaHow to prepare for Quantitative Aptitude for the CAT by Arun Sharma – It is probably the most popular book for Quantitative Aptitude for CAT. It covers all the necessary topics in great detail and has enough number of solved examples as well. The main problem with the book is LOD-3. For those of you who don’t know, this book has exercises divided into three levels. The last level is called ‘Level of Difficulty – 3’ and frankly speaking it is quite useless for most CAT aspirants. The questions in these exercises are a lot harder than what you can expect in CAT. The problem that this creates is that CAT aspirants like to finish a chapter (and they should) before moving on to the next topic. Invariably, they get stuck in a few questions in LOD-3 and give up. If not, they end up wasting a lot of time on stuff that they do not need to know or learn. The benefit of using this popular book is that you can google almost all of the questions and you would find a discussion on the same online. Someone or the other would have discussed it before. There are three more books by TMH / Arun Sharma that you can consider:How to prepare for Data Interpretation for the CAT.How to prepare for Logical Reasoning for the CAT.How to prepare for Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension for the CAT.The set of all four books should cost you around 2500 Rs. I would not recommend that you go in for that. The only book that you should get from this set is the Quant book.Books by Pearson – Nishit SinhaPearson Guide to Quantitative Aptitude for CAT by Nishit Sinha – In my opinion, it is a much better book than the TMH book for the simple reason that it has more problems that are at par with the CAT difficulty level. It also has a lot of extra harder problems but you can and you should skip those. The problem with this book is that even after revisions, it does have some typos and errors. Be that as it may, it is my preferred book recommendation in this category. However, if you decide to go ahead with Nishit Sinha, I would much rather recommend these two books:Pearson Guide to Quantitative Aptitude and Data Interpretation for CAT by Nishit Sinha.Pearson Guide to Verbal Ability and Logical Reasoning for CAT by Nishit Sinha.These two books as a combo would cost you around 1500 Rs. It would be money well spent. While for Quant, it can be debated which is the better book between TMH / Pearson, for LR / DI / RC – Pearson book wins hands down. I especially love the way RC is dealt with in the Pearson books. To be honest, I would have recommended that you go in for The Pearson Complete Guide to CAT that costs around 800 Rs. but the number of printing mistakes/ errors is a bit too high in that one.Books by Arihant PublicationsVerbal Ability and Reading Comprehension by Ajay Singh – It is a pretty good book for Reading Comprehension. It has loads of passages for you to go through. I am often surprised by the lack of popularity of this one. It can be picked up if you are looking at a book specifically for VA and RC.Quantum CAT by Sarvesh Verma – If you already have some coaching institute’s material and are looking for something extra to practice in Quant (I do not agree with this idea but if you are), then probably this is the book that you need to pick up. It covers a large variety of questions and the difficulty level is also maintained. This book does not have the unnecessarily hard questions like most of the other books. Both of these above books are around 700 Rs.Which book(s) to buy for CAT Preparation?Now that I am done with the dispensing of ‘Gyaan’ regarding the books, if you are still confused about which book to buy – let me try and simplify it for you. If you have study material from a coaching institute like IMS / TIME / CL, you should try to finish it from start to end. You should not even look at any other books.If you have study material from a relatively smaller coaching institute like MBA Guru / Total Gadha / Byjus – I have no idea about how good or bad they are. Talk to your faculty – they will give you an unbiased opinion about it. If you want a book just for Quantitative Aptitude – go for Arun Sharma or Quantum CAT. Pick Arun Sharma if are comfortable searching on forums and looking up answers. That will help you learn some more stuff as well.Pick Quantum CAT if you just want to sit with the book and solve. If you want a book just for Verbal Ability – go to the VA / RC book by Arihant (Ajay Singh). If you want a book just for LR / DI / RC – there isn’t something that I can recommend. I don’t think you need a book just for that. Use previous year papers, and previous year mocks, etc. If you want books for everything – go for the two books by Pearson.I hope that all the information given about CAT preparation will help you as you needed. More information on the CAT preparation can be accessed from Getentrance.","First of all i am sharing very useful infographics then i will share best books which helps you to crack CAT Exam in First Attempt.CAT (Common Admission Test) is the entrance exam that is to be given by the aspirants who want to go for MBA (Master of Business Administration) or PGDM (Post Graduate Diploma in Management) from a top reputed college or institute.It is one of the toughest examinations and the competition is also very high due to the high number of students aspiring to get enrolled in reputed business schools to achieve their goals.CAT is an online or computer-based test and consists of three sections namely Quantitative Ability (QA), Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VRC), and Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DI & LR).While preparing for the examination, going for the option of coaching classes is much recommended as they help in understanding the examination and the syllabus with their expertise.

You can refer to any of these. I referred the latter one as suggested by one of my friends. However, I think the former is more popular with the students. Both the books are good. But don’t buy both. No need to unnecessary collect a lot of books & material. If you have limited time, solving one book is enough. Go for the second book only when you have finished the entire syllabus.Quantitative Aptitude:::Most problems in CAT/GMAT are actually meant to test your ability to look at a complex scenario and find simple solutions to it. You are wannabe managers, right ? A manager is not somebody who is a mathematical genius, but somebody who is proficient at efficient utilization of resources. In most problems, a bulk of calculation can be avoided by using logical arguments. This is the best way to speed up calculations – avoid the need for calculations. Before rushing on to make a calculation – stop to see if there are logical explanations that can resolve things to a great degree ? You will be surprised, that in most cases, this actually turns out to be so. The questions for these examinations are carefully crafted not to test whether you can find a cube-root, but to find out whether you can find the inherent patterns in the problem and reveal the underlying simplicity. Refer to these books for practise-How to Prepare for Quantitative Aptitude for CAT by Arun SharmaQuantum CAT by Sarvesh VermaPearson Guide for Quantitative AptitudeData Interpretation & Logical Reasoning :::Don’t get overawed by the sheer size of the table in the CAT paper. They are just a tool to frighten you. Like in comprehension, read the question before scanning the data. This will help you avoid fighting with and filtering useless data. Instead of doing exact calculation try approximation, while solving this section. All your hard work during Maths preparation will help you in approximation. If you have good grasp of the concept you can develop your own short cuts and you would never need to memorise them. Try to avoid using pen and paper while solving this section. Once the examiner forces you to use pen and paper then he succeeds in trapping you in the maze of endless calculation which is known as mathematics. Consider the following books for practise -Logical Reasoning for the CAT by Nishit K. SinhaHow to Prepare for Logical Reasoning for the CAT by Arun SharmaHow to Prepare for Data Interpretation for the Cat by Arun SharmaVerbal Ability and Reading comprehension :::Read the editorial sections of popular newspapers like the Hindu.

Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-did-99+-percentilers-prepare-for-CAT,"Prepathon, Exam and Test Results, Common Admission Test Percentiles, Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",100+,"My authority on the subject? I scored a 99.75 percentile in CAT, 99.55 in XAT, 99.45 in SNAP. This is a walkthrough of my preparation/ how you can go about preparing for CAT and other entrance exams.CAT is considered to be one of the most difficult entrance exams in India, but it is isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most of the topics that are tested in CAT are High school level topics. The difficulty lies in the fear of the test. Most CAT aspirants resign to an assumption that they can’t score above a certain percentile without even knowing what the test is made off, half the game is lost at this point.I have been guilty of the same myself. Jan 2016, I remember looking at lists of MBA colleges and immediately rejecting the top 30 odd colleges for the fact that they all required you to score above 97 percentile or so to realistically make into those colleges. It was only when I talked to my father and he explained to me the negativity in my thinking, that I realised, I hadn’t even seen what CAT consisted of. I had no logic in leaving out the possibility of scoring an extremely high percentile.Another reason why I felt that I had to score an extremely high percentile were my 12th class marks. MBA colleges give weightage to academic profile. A self-analysis made me realise that having a low score in my 12th class (69%) was a huge handicap. If I had got a low percentile I would’ve found it extremely difficult to make into the colleges of the relevant level. I would’ve ended up in colleges ranked even lower. I had to score a 99+ percentile. BELIEVE you can Crack the CATHow to go about:I have divided the preparation for CAT into four parts:Pre-preparation, Preparation, Practice, Taking the CATPre-PreparationThere are a few things you’ll want to have in place before you start your preparation for CAT and other exams.Find three hours a day (not in bits and pieces here and there) three continuous hours to prepare. This can be extremely difficult if you are working/ attending college. This might help you to find a few extra hours a day.Get rid of any distractions that you believe affect your concentration or mental state in general. (social media is one of the biggest time-suck and tends to distract you even if you aren’t online)Get in touch with someone who has cracked the entrance exam or has some expertise in the same, you could approach a local coaching centre. (you may not enrol as a full-time student but you would want to be in touch with the faculty there by buying their material or tests etc.) This will be helpful in getting certain finner tips and in case you have difficulties.Get yourself a campaign manager. Cracking the CAT and getting an admission into an MBA college is a long drawn process. You are bound to lose interest or forget important things/ deadlines. Get someone who will keep track of the same. For me, it was my father who helped me keep track of my preparation and all the college applications. Make sure the person you chose exactly understands the process and understands what you want. They will make sure that you are still going even when the motivation starts to run out.Read a lot. This is extremely important when it comes to the verbal ability section of CAT. You will need a lot of broad-based readings and an ability to make sense of what you have read quickly. The passages for reading comprehension in CAT are sometimes extremely abstract and can be extremely difficult to make sense if you aren’t used to reading a lot. Places where you should want to read from: Medium, The guardian, Businessweek Bloomberg, Also read some classic novels that you can lay your hands on, the books talked about on crash course literature are a good place to start.PreparationCAT is divided into 3 sections verbal ability reading comprehension, logical reasoning data interpretation, and quantitative ability. Each of the sections requires equal effort and attention.Time for preparation: There are many people and sites who will tell you that you need 14 hours a day to prepare for CAT. Trust me that doesn’t work. You just need 3 to 4 hours a day consistently over a period of 3- 4 months to crack CAT. Anything more than 5 hours a day can and will burn you out.Source material for preparation: A common mistake that most aspirants will make is relying on just one book/ one source for preparation (particularly anyone who takes coaching). It is recommended that you have access to at least some material from different authors. This will provide you with multiple points of view for the same problems. (same goes for mock tests recommended that take at least 4 to 5 tests from A differen source).Verbal Ability & Reading ComprehensionThis is one of the most frustrating sections in CAT. The question often can seem to have multiple solutions and where options are provided all of them seem correct. Even if you are extremely good with English you can end up messing this section.The key to cracking this section (particularly Verbal ability part) is understanding that this section is more about logic than language. You have to understand the logic as to how the solutions are arrived at (jumbled para is the killer in this section).I initially worked this section by looking at the solutions, that way I was able to see what patterns to look out for and what logic to apply.Work on improving your ability to comprehend complex /long sentences, particularly from topics that you aren’t used to and having complex vocabulary.This section will take a lot of practice to master, more practice than the other two sections. This section has the highest returns for scores. If you get a slightly higher score in this section your percentile can increase drastically. (I scored a 99.98 percentile in this section).Even if you have a good command over the language DO NOT take this section lightly, I know of aspirants who have the CAT along with me having excellent command over the language yet messing up this section completely.Data interpretation and logical reasoningData interpretation is a practice intensive section. There is nothing new that you have to learn in this section. It is just the ability to carry out basic calculations using tools you already have (percentages, averages, summation, division). Practice these basic tools thoroughly so that you are extremely comfortable with them. Also get acquainted with all the various forms of data presentation, such as graphs, pie charts, tables, caselets etc.Logical reasoning is a section which you should and can make the most out of it. The questions are very often similar. While practising logical reasoning the things you would want to learn is gauging the difficulty of the question quickly. If a question is difficult, move on to the next one (time is important).You would want to practice visualising the problem (in mind / on paper ) in the simplest way possible. This will help you breakdown huge paragraphs full of seemingly meaningless words into sensible data.Learn to have an unbiased mind. One of the mistakes you can make in this section is assume somehting that isnt true. Learn to use all the information provided and only than make any conclusion.Read the data carefully a single word can change the whole situation. (for ex. XYZ is not wearing a black pant. can easily be mistaken for XYZ wearing a pant if you miss out on the not.)Quantitative abilityThis is one of the more easier sections to get by, You just have to understand the concepts behind all the topics involved. Again the topics in this section are high school level math. You can over prepare for this section and most aspirants do.There are certain topics in this section that you would want to be extremely thorough with since they appear most frequently (going by the trends of past so many years), such as time speed distance, time work, Geometry, Functions.You would want to also be thorough with averages alligations, percentages ratios since these topics are more helpful in DI section but very rarely make an appearance as stand-alone questions in QA section.Number systems personally I felt for me was an extremely overrated topic ( I spent way more time than required here)PracticeTaking mock tests, I feel mock tests will be the most important part of your preparation as they help you guage exactly where you stand. (another benefit is to know which colleges you should apply to).What is a good number of mock tests to take? There isn’t any concensus on this topic, there are CAT toppers who got by on hardly any mock tests, and than there are people like me who took close 40 mock tests.Personally mock tests where the biggest source of practice for me. I took mock tests from 3 different sources. ( I recommend atleast 2 different sources). Once you have taken a mock test it’s extremely important that you analyse them well, I spent about an hour and half after every mock test to analyse where I have gone wrong and what can be changed. Mock tests are also a good time to test out strategies in handling various sections. (I will try to come with a detailed post about analysing mock tests.)I will boast a little here, but thanks to the trends on my mock tests I was extremely confident of getting the percentile I got on CAT. ( I expected at least a 99.5 %le)I recommend practicing during the time slot you will actually be answering the CAT, I had to take the CAT on a sunday in the morning slot (9.30 to 12.30) at a centre 30 kms away from home. Considering the reporting time of an extra hour, I would have to technically leave my house at 7 in the morning on the day of the test. I usually get hungry within 2 and half hours of eating anything. So in the month before CAT I trained my body, by having breakfast at 6 in the morning and not having anything till 1pm. I also trained myself to sit at one place for 4 hours (830 to 1230). This may seem funny/ unnecessary but on the day of the test you dont want to have any other factors troubling you.Taking the CATTry to stop preparation for CAT at least 3 days before CAT (there are people who will disagree and reccommend you remain in the mood and keep preparing) anything you try to “prepare” during these last days often will be of very little help. Don’t wander away from the CAT mood though, read or at least make sure you are sitting 3 hours at a place for these last few days ( to stay in the CAT mood).Do not take a mock test in the few days before CAT, If you mess the mock it is likely that you will panic on the day of the CAT.Do not keep any expectations as to the number of questions you want to complete in each section.All the best for your preparation for CAT.P.S. CAT isn’t everything, CAT is hardly a learning experience, you won’t learn anything new as such (well other than how to prepare hard) it’s mostly about things you already know, taking the CAT can hence be a very frustrating experience. I recommend that you learn something else too on the side lines, get a hobby or hold a job (again debatable as to how much time you can find etc.) If you are taking drop read a lot, read all the books you can get your hands on. All in all try to do something else too that will help you grow.Belling the CAT and other entrance exams","This answer is fairly long, about 7000 words. So I have divided my answer into 9 parts wherein each part can be read independently. However reading the entire answer in one go will serve as RC practice, so that would be advisable.What I have mentioned below helped me in my journey from 66% -> 99.85% in CAT. I have tried my level best to be as detailed as possible. GK as a section is not there in CAT as of now but is very important in the other papers like XAT, IIFT, SNAP, etc. So, I have included that as well. I have also put in a little bit about how to attempt mocks and then analyse them to improve further. A little bit on GD-PI-WAT as well, so that this answer serves all your needs.I would like to point out that I have been an average student all my life and am a GEM (General Engineer Male), yes pun intended. My 10/12/B.Tech scores are 83/79/66. With that I made it to IIM Calcutta, so the first thing that you should now do is stop worrying about your previous grades. 99% of the people reading this will surely have better grades. So, if I can you obviously can get through and study at an IIM.My CAT 2015 score card:QA: 99.8%LRDI: 99.96%VA: 87.33%OA: 99.85%This answer is divided into the following parts:A.) How to start?B.)

You could try hitbullseye. If you have already enrolled for a test series or for a classroom programme, then attempt one of their mocks. Many of you would be like bhai abhi toh padhai start bhi nahi ki, mock deke kya hoga aur upar se aadhe questions toh samajh bhi nahi aayenge aur maths ke formula bhi yaad nahi hain. Additionally while attempting the mock, there will be multiple instances when you will feel like getting up because you are not used to solving questions for 3 hours at a stretch. Your brain will also try to deceive you into grabbing your smart phone for checking Whatsapp. You will feel like drinking water, you will also be tempted to check FB. The point of this test is to make sure that all this doesn’t happen when you actually attempt CAT. Now you would be thinking what is the point in attempting a mock when I don’t know $hi+.Precisely my point! The main reason for this mock was to identify what you know, what you don’t, where you stand and how much hard work is required.Once you are done with the mock, check the solutions and find the topics which you already know, which you attempted correctly. Some problems would have been there which you would have been sure of but you got them wrong because you were out of touch and forgot the formula or recalled an incorrect formula. You probably forgot the plural of fish. Fish or fishes? Or does it depend on whether I am talking about a species of fish or multiple units of the same species? Then you will realise that a little brush up of a few topics (which you are out of touch with) will dramatically improve your score. Work on these topics first and then move on to topics which you have no clue about. This mock decides your future course of study.Now, on to the preparation phase.B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityStart off with this site. http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/Click on start and then check your score. You know where you stand. Keep practising a few times every day and your score will keep improving. If you can hit 50-55 consistently in the default 120 seconds, you will easily hit 99.5% in CAT in this section. If you are targeting 99.5+ then I would also like you to memorise the following:B1.) Reciprocals, Squares and Cubes up till 30. Pay attention here, some values will get repeated. As for 1/7. Remember that it is .142857. For other go up to 2-3 decimals,whatever you are comfortable with. I would prefer 3 decimals though.B2.) Power of 2 up till 12Power of 3 up till 8Power of 4 up till 6Power of 5-6 up till 5Power of 7-10 up till 4Power of 11-13 up till 3Again same as above. Some values will be the same. 4^6 has already been covered till 2^12 and so on. Don’t just mug up blindly, pay attention to the numbers.B3.) Square Root up till 10B4.) Factorial up till 10B1-B4: Now most of you would be like, dude they give an inbuilt calculator. But then other exams don’t have that calculator. Additionally who do you think will take lesser time in solving a question? A person who uses the calculator for finding 12^3 or someone who just knows it is 1728. Believe me when I say that this is very important for your LRDI section as well. This will decide whether you get stuck at 99.5% or go beyond that. This is the deciding factor. Please memorise these values.B5.) A few important numbers like 999=27*37, 1001=7*11*13, 21^3=9261.B6.) Some numbers have the property wherein the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the no itself. 1, 2, 145 and 40585. Please remember these.B7.) There are 15 primes till 50, 25 till 100, 46 till 200 and 168 till 1000.B8.) How to find the sum of the first n natural nos. Sum of squares of n natural nos. Sum of cubes, sum of 4th powers. Please remember the formulas. Specially the last one (fourth power), most people forget that.B9.) Scale is not allowed in any of the exams. What the CAT authorities mean is that the scale which we used back in school that is not allowed. They never said anything about using your hand as a scale. Check the length of your fingers. Also check the length of the 3 sub division on your fingers. Use your right or left hand, whatever suits you. Please make sure that you remember these values by heart. These values will help you solve 90% of the geometry questions. Also, buy a protractor and make sure you can make the angles 30, 45, 60, 90 properly. First with the protractor and then without it. Based on the question, make a rough figure. Then based on your lengths, find the answer and then scale up to the value given in the question. Geometry has a lot of formulas, memorize them or use this approach. Approximation ftw!B.10.) Unitary Method. Make sure you are good with this, half the QA syllabus can be solved using unitary method. Do you think whatever has been mentioned in B9 is basically Unitary Method at the end for getting the answer?Most of the students go for solving the maximum no of problems. Don’t do that. Focus on the basics, don't go for solving questions directly like most students. Most students don’t score 99+. You are different, work differently. This is how you should be doing it for any given chapter day wise. First day go after the formulas and try to understand why a certain formula is there. Make sure that you have memorised all the formulas for that chapter. If you were to set the paper, what could be a possible question? Read a formula, try to frame questions on that formula and then memorize the formula. Just memorizing all formulas in one go won't help, because you will probably forget. If you can do this, then you would have solved all the questions by the time you finish reading the theory.Example: Let's say you are studying Numbers. You see the formulas for HCF and LCM of 2 nos. Then you see the factors of a number. Now think of possible questions on this. Let's say 72.1.) How many odd factors are there?2.) How many even factors are there?3.) What is the sum of the odd factors?4.) What is the sum of the even factors?5.) What is the product of the odd factors?6.) What is the product of the even factors?7.) How many factors are squares of natural numbers?8.) How many factors are cubes of natural numbers?Good going, you just completed half the chapter! Similarly think of more questions that you can make. The exercise at the end is filled with such questions. It depends on your thinking. Focus on this. If basics are fine,questions won't be a problem.Would you memorize 456*876 and 235*9865 and things like that or learn how multiplication works?If you think that you lack imagination when it comes to maths and can’t do the above, then no problem. As mentioned above, by the end of the first day you would be done with memorising all the formulas. That’s it. Don’t solve anything. Just make sure all the formulas are deeply rooted in your brain and you can recall them anytime you want. Now take a break for a day. On the 3rd day, start solving problems. But remember that you are to solve by recalling the formula not by turning over the pages and looking at the formula. If you cannot recall, then please make sure you memorize the formulas again. Solve a few problems. Take a day’s break and continue solving on the 5th and similarly on the 7th day as well. This way apart from the formula getting imprinted in your brain multiple times, you will also understand which formulas are asked more often than others. Some chapters are connected to one another. Make groups of such chapters. If working on a group, try to complete all the topics in that group. For example:Ratio Proportion, Unitary Method, Percentage, Profit and Loss.Simple equations, Simultaneous equations, Inequalities, Time speed distance and work, Quadratic.Progression.Numbers, Bases, Miscellaneous equations.Surds and Indices, Logarithms.Mensuration.Geometry.Coordinate Geometry.Probability and PnC.Functions and Graphs.For people trying to clear the cut off in this section. The first 3 with mensuration and a bit of geometry/numbers will be enough.C.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningData Interpretation is speed and practise. The site mentioned in the Quant region and B1-B4 there would be of immense help. These will increase your speed. Generally each and every DI set has at least a problem on percentage or ratio.Today when you start, start off with the sole intention of solving all the questions of a given set. When you can do that on a daily basis. Move to 2 sets a day. When you can do that. Move to 3 sets daily and then to 4 sets. Keep solving as many questions as you can. Time taken per question will decrease with practise. A few months after you were born, you started to crawl, then you started walking and finally you started running. Same thing here. Don’t think about speed now. Speed comes gradually. Let nature take its course.Logical Reasoning, as the name suggests is based on how well you can interpret and analyse things. LR checks your thought process, it checks how you tackle problems. Get this book ""Puzzles"" by George J. Summers. When you watch a football match, why do you watch it? Probably because you want your team to win or you want to see a good contest and enjoy. Similarly, once you have bought this book, think about your objective. It’s not about getting the correct solution, it’s about improving your thought process. And additionally the puzzles in this book are tough. You could think of it as the daddy of Irodov. Engineers will get the joke! You won’t be able to solve most of the problems and frankly speaking I don’t expect you to. However, what I do expect from you is to read a question. Try to understand what has been given. Try to understand what is being asked. Think about it for say 10-15 minutes. Write down whatever approach you can think of. If you could not solve it, look at the hints and their solution scheme. Were you thinking in the right direction?Analyse the difference between the method given in the book and your method.Try to understand what you missed because of which you could not solve the puzzle. Try again for 30 minutes. If you can solve it, good enough, if not maybe try again. After a few more tries look at the solution. Remember you bought the book to improve your thought process, not to solve each question in the first attempt. Trying a puzzle for 5 minutes and then looking at the solution will take you nowhere. Solving again and again till the time you get the answer is what the book was bought for. To make sure that you can think and get the answer on your own. The answer at the end is just for verification. 1-2 puzzles a day. 3 at max, not more than that. You have to improve your thought process,not complete the book as fast as possible. Your scores in the LR section will improve in a month’s time and then it will stay at 99%.Another very important point would be to memorize the alphabet-number conversion table. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. You will come across questions on this in your mocks as well as in the exams.D.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI had 69 and 72 in English in 10 and 12 respectively. My verbal score in CAT went up from 43 -> 87%. Whatever I have written below is what I did to make sure that I cleared the verbal cut off comfortably. If you are looking at a 99+verbal score, then you would be better off by reading the other answers to this question for improving your verbal section. This part is not for you kindly move on to the LRDI section. If you however $uck at English just like me, then this just might help you in clearing the sectional cut off. I tried memorizing words from the GRE word list. My language skills were not good enough to use words like persiflage, perspicuous, ubiquitous, scintillating, etc. in sentences. So, I would keep memorizing and then keep forgetting these words. I had never read novels so I had never come across such words as well. So, I came to the conclusion that memorising words won’t help me. But, a decent vocabulary is needed for CAT. So, I bought this book “Word Power Made Easy” by Normal Lewis. Managed to complete the chapters in a few months. I didn’t do the word list at the end. I would request you to buy this book and complete the chapters.Another thing that seemed obvious to me was that whether you look at RCs or Para Jumbles or Para Completion or Para Summary. All these have basically been written by some person who had a very good command over the English language. So all these things should logically have a flow of thought with which the author would have written the entire thing. You just have to understand that flow. If you can understand an RC, then understanding a paragraph from that RC will obviously be very easy for you. Think about it, a PJ or a PC or a PS are basically paragraphs taken from an RC. You just have to understand the flow in which the entire thing was written by some person who had a decent understanding of the English language. But, then I again had a problem. The Verbal section in CAT was supposed to be of 1 hour and as soon as I would start reading an RC, 8-10 minutes down the line I would feel drowsy. I would start thinking about checking FB or Whatsapp or practically doing anything apart from reading that stupid RC. All those Speed reading techniques, skimming, reading the question first and all. None of that mattered. I understood what my problem was. COMPREHENSION and CONCENTRATION. By the time I was in the 2nd para I would have forgotten what was written in the 1st para. It’s called a READING COMPREHENSION for a reason. Never trade comprehension for speed.How to improve comprehension and concentration?Both will improve gradually with time. First step is to make sure that you don’t feel drowsy when reading for an hour. You will be required to do that in the exam. So you need to build your stamina to concentrate. Start off by reading 2-3k word long articles on News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian. Register on the website and you will get a mail every morning at 10am. Read all the articles from there. Make sure you read at a stretch for an hour. Read everything from Culture to Technology to Art to Literature. In the beginning you will feel sleepy within a few minutes of starting. Slowly you will gain rhythm. Within 15 days you will be able to read 1 hour at a stretch. In a month’s time you will start retaining information as well. Then focus on just 1 category every day. Like only Philosophy or only Art or only culture. With that your stamina and concentration will increase further and since you are reading about only 1 thing for 1 hour, your knowledge in that topic will also increase. This can be done at home, but preferably in office to better utilize your time. PJ PC PS are all extensions of an RC. All will seem easy once you are comfortable with RCs. Here News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian you will be reading 2000-3000 word long articles. Once you are used to this, 500-600 word passages in CAT and other exams will be a piece of cake for you!For verbal, always eliminate choices and then mark rather than directly trying to find the correct answer. This section is different from the other sections,so it has to be dealt in a different manner. Please eliminate choices and then answer. If in doubt, leave. As for the grammar section, I have no idea when to use have and when to use has. Same with is/are and things like that. Neither can I spot grammatical errors in sentences. So, I mostly leave such questions.But I always read them. You can always answer a few of them based on instinct. Some sitters are always there in every paper.E.) GK -> General KnowledgeAll the papers except CAT have this section. Some have a sectional cut off,some don’t. This section can be answered in about 5 minutes. It has the highest marks/min for any section. This section is the key to a high percentile. This section will give you the points for speaking in a GD and PI and also for writing in WAT. So, if you plan on getting through to a good B-School don’t ignore it. There would be 2 methods to prepare for this.E1.) Start reading any newspaper. Go through the headlines and all. Make sure you are updated with what is happening in the country. After a week or so, you will realise that it’s mostly the same thing that keeps getting repeated everyday in the paper. Think of it from the point of view of the exam. There will be MCQs. So they won’t ask for your opinion on Kejriwal vs Modi. Leave all the pages on politics. That’s sheer wastage of time. Don’t waste time on that stuff! Make sure you remember the schemes which Mr Modi keeps rolling out. At least remember the important ones. Did any big firm buy another one? Any Indian who won some award abroad. Who won which Grand Slam? Who won the Pulitzer Prize? Who won the Arjuna Khel Ratna Award? India is working on the Chabahar port with which country? Malcom Turnbull is from which country? I think you would have understood what is expected from you. MBA is about business. Focus on economic and business news more than others. Noble Prize in economics fort his year? How many Deputy Governors are there in the Reserve Bank? Make a doc file with these details. You file would look somewhat like this.https://docs.google.com/document...This is what I had made for this year, so no this won’t help you! You will have to make one with the current affairs of this year. Since you will be working the entire year making this, so by the time the exams are a week away, you will have such a file. You might however think that this is too much work. In that case I would suggest you try the second and relatively easier method compared to this.E2.) Whichever is the first exam for you which will have a GK section, keep 4 days before that exam for making this file and memorizing it. Gather all the monthly booklets which are given to Time students. Each book has about 100 questions. Memorize the ones you think are important. CL and Time both will also have a few sheets on GK, current affairs, etc. Get those as well. CL GK compendium. Hitbullseye gk pdfs are also there. You can get most of these online for free or search on Pagalguy, someone would have uploaded it there for sure. Whatever you think is important, please memorize that. 4 days is more than enough to complete all the material I have mentioned above. By going through the monthly magazines you will also be able to keep track of what is happening in India and also round the globe.The regular reading (The first method, reading daily) means that when the exam sare about to start, you would have completed most of the things. The last 4 days will serve as a revision for you. I did both the above things. So if you have time go for it. A close friend of mine, Prateek, he was preparing for UPSC. He was of immense help! Whenever I would meet him, we would talk about how things going on in our country. Served as revision for him and I would stay updated with facts. So, if you can find someone who is preparing for UPSC religiously,i t would be great. You will also have a contact who is an IAS officer. If you want to score even higher in GK get a small yearbook from some shop. Small ones general contain 100 odd pages, going through that will serve as revision as well.F.) How to attempt mocks (Non-CAT exams at the end)The first step here is to make sure that you can sit and concentrate properly for 3 hours at a stretch. FB, Whatsapp, drowsiness, drinking water or the sudden urge to go to the washroom during these 3 hours have to be removed.Kindly take care of such things which might disturb you, especially the last 2 and then start a mock. When you are attempting the mock, the only thing in your mind should be about maximising your score! Another point that you should keep in mind in that no one cares about what you know and what you don’t. The only thing that matters is your score. So please keep your ego aside when attempting the paper. Yeh question kaise nahi bana, kal hi toh banaya tha and then you spend the next 15 mins on it and still end up marking the wrong answer. Please don’t! You have a fight with your girlfriend and then you are like “I am not texting her first”. Yes I was talking about that very ego of yours, please get rid of it when you are attempting a mock. If you can’t solve a question then please move on to the next one. The examination hall is not the place to derive a formula and then solve the concerned problem. Anyways, I could go on but I think I have made my point.Remember that half the paper is very easy, mostly formula based. Your approach should be to attempt these questions first. Make sure that you have touched the 97-98% mark and then move on to the difficult questions for improving your score.F1.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityYou are not supposed to start from question no 1 and then continue till 34. Most of the times you will not even be able to look at some of the problems in the end. So we will follow a Round by round approach. About 50% of the problems are direct formula based. When you start this section (Round 1), keep the above point in mind. So, as soon as you look at a question. Can you solve it in a minute by using a formula? If the question with a formula was given to a 5th grader, would he be able to solve it. If yes, then solve this question. Use the values given in the question, get the answer and then move on to the next question. If you see a question and you are like, yaar yeh toh banaya hua hai, 2-3 min lagega, lamba question hai. Or if you are like sirf cases likhne hain, phir count kar lunga, phir answer. Such questions which you know you can solve but are not direct formula based, are to be left out now. These have to be attempted in the 2nd round. Getting my point? If formula based, then attempt else next. Within 30 minutes you should have attempted about 16-17 questions and you would have seen all the questions. That will get you at least 97-98% in this section.Now Round 2, there were a few questions which you had seen earlier and were pretty confident about. This is where your brain will help you. The human mind is so awesome that even though you just looked at it once but solved different questions and totally forgot about it, you brain was working on that question subconsciously without you having any idea about it. Now, when you read the question, you will take a lesser amount of time to solve it compared to what you would have taken had you solved it in the first round itself. You could go for Round 3 as well, your choice! But 2 rounds are needed. Please stop with a single round method which most of you are used to now.Why this approach?Many people are most often not able to see the entire paper,so they miss sitters. This round by round technique helps you go through the entire paper and thereby select the easiest ones which in turn maximises your score. You won’t get a prize if you solve a question that only 10 students out of 2 lac could solve. The marks per question is the same. Since you solve the easier problems first, the chances of your committing mistakes goes down considerably. A question which you have solved but incorrectly is not wasted time and only a -1 for your score. Instead of 3 you get a -1. So such a question effectively hits you with lost time and a -4. This method reduces the no of such questions. Hence, this approach.F2.) DILR -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningIf you have tried solving the book which I had mentioned above, you would by now have a fair idea about how to make a table for solving LR problems. 5 people, 5 countries, 5 cars, 5 pets. All of us have solved such puzzles,haven’t we? You would obviously have 4 columns but which would be the first and which would be the second, etc. That determines how fast you will be able to solve the set. Oh, you thought it didn’t make a difference? It does! Sometimes you are better off soling set theory problems by a table. This is where your practise and experience comes into play. Making the proper table means half the work is done then and there. You just have to put in the values and tick mark the correct answers now.Now about how to attempt. When you start the section, go through the 4 LR sets.1-2 sets will be very easy. Take a couple of minutes and try to identify the easier ones. Look at the questions. Do you see any question wherein it asks how many cases are possible or questions of that sort? Such sets are to be solved at the end. Look for sets wherein directly by looking at the questions, you know that there is one unique solution. Use the answer options to further reduce your time for soling that set. Now start with such sets. First advantage of this method will be that you will feel good, because you will be done with a couple of sets in 10-12 minutes. Additionally you will be in a flow and your chances of cracking a difficult set will go up. Now compare this to the case when you start the section, and think that looking at all the questions means losing a few minutes. I am James Bond, so I will start with the first set. 10 minutes later you haven’t completed a single question and now for the remaining 50 minutes you will keep thinking, yaar 10 min faaltu mein barbaad ho gaye. Good luck solving that section and the next with such a mind-set.Many a time it will happen that the set you picked up, is going nowhere and yet time is passing on. For such sets, wherein you have already spent 4-5 minutes but haven’t been able to mark even a single question. Please leave that set.You might be tempted to think sirf 2 min aur, aur phir 4 questions ban jayenge. Please don’t commit that mistake. 5 minutes is the threshold in which you should have been able to mark at least 2 questions. Worst case scenario 1. If you are at 0. Please move on. You are better off solving that set later on,preferably at home!Same with DI sets, go through the sets, select the easier ones, and complete them. You will be left off with 2 sets. Again with 2 options, it always easy to select the easier one. This way most of the times, you will end up solving the toughest set at the end or you will probably leave it. All questions have the same marks, so isn’t it better to solve easier ones? Additionally tougher problems will also take a toll on your brain, your effectiveness for the next section might go down. Do you want that to happen?Sometimes a set will be easy but a question in there will be extremely tough.Beware of such questions, these are put in place to derail your momentum. 5-7 minutes per set is what you should be looking at. Always look at the questions and attempt. You don’t have to attempt all questions from a set. Even 3 attempts for a set is fine. Again, you know the term that I am talking about!Keep that aside when attempting a mock.F3.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI get tired of reading and lose interest quickly. So RCs at the end seems a bad idea. So, I start off with RCs. Again as soon as you start this section. Glance through all the RCs in a minute and check if any of them is from a subject you like. Your reading speed and comprehension will be higher in this case. Again as mentioned above, just because you read an RC, doesn’t mean you have to attempt all the questions. Even 4 out of 6 questions from an RC is good enough. Just attempting for the sake of increasing attempts is sheer stupidity. Please don’t think ki aree yaar itne marks toh already aa hi rahe hain exam mein. Dusron ko thoda mauka de deta hun -2 leke. Please don’t do that. Eliminate options and then attempt. When in doubt leave. Move on to the single questions after the RCs.Note -> For non-CAT mocks which you attempt online.First and foremost thing is that apart from CAT, most are pen paper based, but at home you attempt online papers for these. Take a few print outs of the OMR sheet and check how many minutes you need for marking the answers. Keep a 5 min buffer for your safety. Let’s say we talk about IIFT. It’s a 2 hour paper in real. However I need 20 minutes just for marking the bubbles. So, there is absolutely no point in attempting the online paper at home for 2 hrs. Submit the test after 100 minutes. Don’t worry if people attempt for 2 hours and your rank is low. Your score in the main exam matters, not in this one. Similarly for SNAP and XAT as well. Form a basic strategy of how you would like to attempt the paper for the 100 minutes(whatever your time is after you have checked marking in the OMR sheet). Like for Snap, I had a strategy of 5-6 minutes for gk then 16-18 minutes for verbal, then 35-40 minutes for LR. Then maths and as soon as it would be 90 minutes after the start, I would mark all the answers. Then solve and again mark in the last 5 minutes. Similarly make your strategy for IIFT, SNAP, XAT, etc. and stick to it.G.) How to analyse mock?The instant you submit a mock, you will have a score in mind, itna toh banta hai. 1 sec later the page reloads and you see your score and you go, are yaar itne toh 2 section milake hi aa jane chahiye the. This is why analysing the mock is important. You knew a certain score was achievable but your score went down drastically because of silly mistakes. Analysing mocks will take care of such mistakes. Once the solutions and result for a mock are out. First of all check up all the problems which you couldn’t solve. That’s what you have to learn.Then look at the time taken by the topper in solving a question. Look at your time. Did you take 200 seconds whereas the topper took 30 seconds? That’s because there is a technique you don’t about. Learn that technique. Write it in your notebook where you write formulas. That was about identifying and learning things which the toppers know. You have to be one of them. Go through the mocks and find such methods. AdditionallyThen there will be a category of questions you were sure of but you somehow used your talent and got it wrong and after looking at the solution you are like aree yaar yeh koi kaise galat kar sakta hai. But as a matter of fact, you did! This will happen mostly in counting problems (Numbers). Even if you had 100 in English in 10 and 12 you will still come to know that you had been using some Grammar rule incorrectly or there is some exception you had no clue about. But, after a -4 you will remember them! You will sometimes come to know that a certain word which you have been using all your life can also be used in a totally different context. Thank You without an exclamation mark? Sarcasm! Oxymoron, alliteration, etc. Learn what these mean. Such mistakes will make sure you remember all these. Sometimes you will take the diameter as the radius and solve. Sometimes 2*3 will become 5 and sometimes 7*19 will become 114. Don’t rush through problems. The paper is set so as to give you enough time. Slow and steady wins the race.Then another section in the results shows the % of people who attempted a question and % of people who got it right. You are supposed to attempt the easy ones first, then the average difficulty questions. Finally attempt a few difficult ones or totally leave them out. Here you can check which questions you were supposed to attempt but didn’t. Also the questions which you were supposed to leave but being the Bond that you are, you nonetheless decided to attempt it thereby losing marks and giving others a chance to overtake you. If your family is worth billions of dollars, you could do that, but given that you are still reading this, I doubt it! So whenever you look at such questions, try to think about what was in your mind during the mock which made you do such a thing. Try not to commit the same mistake again.Yes, I agree all this will take more than 3 hours. Who told you getting into a good B-school was easy?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?The study material from the top 3 institutes namely Time, CL and IMS is mostly the same. I have seen and used it, so use whichever you want, it won’t make a big difference. A few new ones like Hitbullseye and test funda are also coming up. Haven’t used the material by these 2 so can’t comment. In terms of content the level of questions is higher in Time. I mean tougher questions here, so you are better prepared for CAT, but then you could also argue about why put in more effort than required. In CL, the theory and explanations for quant is way better that that in others. Theory for quant is literally non-existent in Time. IMS is good for verbal. As mentioned above, please use that book for LR and also that book for Verbal. I have not mentioned the names of the books, because if you scroll up and check you will then remember the name when you have to tell it to the shopkeeper! That LR book will help make a strong base for you and then completing the LR material from these institutes will give you practise and improve your skills further. For those who keep talking about Arun Sharma, please please please use proper material. Do you really think 1 book is good enough for your CAT preparation and others are stupid who go through all that? If you think you are smart enough and don’t need all that and 1 book is enough. Good Luck with CAT!Mocks basically tell you where you stand when compared to the toppers in the country. Time has the most no of people attempting its Aimcats. So having that is a must. Next in line, with the maximum no of people attempting the mocks would be CL. After that you have IMS, test funda and all. Aimcats are pretty tough when compared to actual CAT but are extremely important because it gives you a true picture of where you stand and how much more effort you need to put in. CL mocks are close to the CAT level especially in terms of quant. IMS mocks are close to CAT level in verbal. I would suggest Time + CL/IMS. You can however take all the 3 if you want. Or maybe some other institute’s mock series. It’s mostly about practise.The mock questions are mostly the same. It’s just the values that they keep changing every year. Same with the material. Whether you look at the material of this year or that of 5 years ago, you will realise that it’s mostly the same. So, you are better off buying old material from someone or from a secondhand book store. I have uploaded some mocks and some prep material. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...https://drive.google.com/open?id...I also found some useful material from total gadha. Here’s the link for thathttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...I.) GD-PI-WAT prepFrankly speaking, getting a score is easy. This is the tougher part. This requires more hard work because in here, you will be up against the best in the country. Most of the people attending the interviews will come prepared, so here your odds will be higher. So, please work hard for this. GDPI prep as such should be dealt with in a different question. So, won’t go into the details here, but just an over view of what is expected of you. If you had done the GK and current affairs part as mentioned above, you will be easily able to manage the WAT. You will also have ample of points for speaking in a GD. Similarly questions on current affairs in a PI will also be a piece of cake for you. What remains is the HR part. In here, you have to understand that you can guide the interview and you can force them to ask exactly what you have prepared. But that requires a little thinking. Tell me about yourself is a standard question which is used to initiate an interview. It is mostly followed by your strengths and weaknesses. The main thing here is that you have to try to make a story and link everything that you have done in your life till now with why you want to do an MBA. The interviewers are smart people, they have been doing this for years. They are extremely good at catching liars. So think this through well. This part of your prep needs your utmost dedication and hard work. Prepare your answers properly. It is really tough to explain how to prepare for GD-PI. You will be better off at some institute where someone can guide you individually. However, what I can still do is upload all the GDPI material that I have and share it with you. But do keep one thing in mind, this contains some files on the current affairs of 2015, so that will be of no use for you. The other stuff is pretty much relevant. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...I hope you convert your dream college. May the force be with you!","How ‘NOT’ To prepare for CAT/GMATOne of the most important strategy in CAT/GMAT is to find out the wrong choices to identify the right one. This post is dedicated to “Avoiding Mistakes” strategy.Myth & Mistake-1: Following the Herd. Choosing a help or any coaching because others are choosing itHumans belongs to Animal kingdom. If you have studied Biology, then this point will be easier to understand. In animal kingdom. Weak animals are always in herd but the strong one is solitary or always having small groups. Ever wondered Why??The answer lies in the mentality. A strong animal judges the situation and leads its life based on its experience but a weak animal actions are based upon others. If others are doing it, then it’s wise to do it. You can choose to be a Herd follower or to make your own paths.Never follow the group. A leader never follows. If you will move with a group, you will always be with them. If you will create your paths, then only you can beat others. Adding following lines from Robert Frost to add a dramatic touch:“Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”Myth & Mistake-2: Focusing on absolute number of Successful Candidates rather than Percentage.Most of the Institutes talks about the number of success stories but are silent on how many of their students were unsuccessful. Even their Advertisements talks about total number of students getting Interview call or final admits. But the real numbers are shocking, most of the Institutes have 2-3 % students getting expected result.But the magic is in numbers. Make people follow a Herd and even if 2-3% students are successful, the success numbers become substantial. The problem is that your chances of landing in the unsuccessful students group is 98%, but this data does not bother them because they know how to work upon the “Herd Mentality” of the population. Show them 2% success stories and make them follow a herd.Myth & Mistake-3: The Bigger the Better.I am referring to Class Strength. No teacher can teach a herd. If your batch size is more than 10-12 students, then you are not getting proper attention from a teacher. If the education company is claiming “Customized or Personalized” services, then the class size must be less than 10-12 students.Myth & Mistake-4: Going after a Brand or No.1 education companyAll Branded books are easily available in the market at very low-cost. A student joins any help or coaching to get a personalized teaching experience. A Teacher-Student relation is analogous to a Mother-Child relation. There is nothing called “No. 1 Mother”. Every mother is No. 1 for her Kids and the reason is her personalized attention.Rather than sitting in a large group with “No. 1”, you should aim for a personalized attention (We join any help for their teachers or their course offering).Myth & Mistake-5: Deciding after taking DemosAll Institutes stage their Demos. They are very carefully planned. The teacher is usually the teacher, who will not teach regularly. If anyone says “Book your demo” or guide you to a specific time, then it is staged. The best way is to ask them about their class timings and insist on sitting in the ongoing class. If you feel the focus is on you, then you are at the wrong place.Try to identify honest institutes. Honesty should be a very important deciding factor.Myth & Mistake-6: Choosing Institute which makes “Toppers” or just focuses on “Past Records”Never choose any institute if its marketing is focused on this fundamental. Keep your basics simple. Think what you want from it and focus on its delivery. You are there for education, not to hear its past stories.Institutes focus on this factor to take your attention away from their product. Your focus should only be on their product, their teachers, their teaching methodologies, their course structures, etc.Myth & Mistake-7: Jo Dikhta hai, Wo (Nahi) Bikta haiA good product needs no marketing. Weak products need marketing. Whenever you see lots of marketing effort, Google ads, ATL or BTL, it proves that the product is weak. Strong product does not need for all these advertisements. In the marketing world, out of 4Ps, the product is supreme. Focus on “Product”.Myth & Mistake-8: Marketing Gimmick-CAT/GMAT Toppers as TeachersThis is the most commonly used marketing tool, which has a flawed assumption. Now I am talking more of “Critical Reasoning” language. The flawed assumption is “All Toppers are good Teachers”. Teaching needs a very different skill set. The teaching is to impart knowledge; all toppers cannot be good teachers and all good teachers cannot be toppers.Myth & Mistake-9: Institutes offering Patented Techniques or “Tips & Tricks”All tests require “Hard Work”. If someone can patent “Hard-work”, then this “Gimmick” should be accepted. “Tips & Tricks” are developed with your hard-work. Shortcuts should be evolved and should never be learnt from someone else. Particularly for CAT/GMAT, which is more of an IQ test, “Techniques, Tips & Tricks” should be evolved.Myth & Mistake-10: CAT/GMAT will take me to HarvardThis point is more applicable to business schools taking GMAT as a screening tool.The student’s full profile will work. The CAT/GMAT is a one small part of the profile. Look at all business schools as a family, no family will allow you to be their part till the time they see their values or virtues in you. Every Business school has a distinct positioning and your profile should be positioned in the same way. Profile building is the main work and every person should concentrate on.Myth & Mistake-11: Adopting Toppers StrategiesHear everyone, but adopt none. Every person develops his own ways depending upon his Strengths & Weaknesses or as per his conditions. Good for someone may not be good for you. Hear everyone, but adopt only wisely.Myth & Mistake-12: Practice-More the merrierPractice Better, Not More. The practice should have a direction, running in circles will not help. Do Tests and review. Keep error Logs and keep on practicing. Practice wisely, so that every time you move, you should learn from your past mistakes. Do not overdo the tests.Myth & Mistake-13: Teachers will make me a TopperTeachers show us directions. Unless you practice the topics taught in the class, it will not work. I saw many students thinking that if they spend more time in classes, it will help.Myth & Mistake-14: All tests just needs lot of studying, no need to focus on healthHealthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. I see many students not focusing on their health during exams. Many of the studious people have unhealthy bodies. You need to balance life with at least 7-8 hours’ sleep.Myth & Mistake-15: I do not need any peer groupYou learn more from peers than the teachers. The most important factor will be jealousy. Competition in the group brings the best out of you. I was very fortunate that all others in my group were good. They have already scored more than 700 in prep tests. Every test was like a world war where every one of us wanted to beat everyone else in the group.Myth & Mistake-16: I will study and practice from lot of free materials on netBeware of free materials. There is no free lunch. Some free materials are good, but most of it is crap. The real test is different from the Free tests you see on the net. You will be caught off-guard if you are preparing from the net material.Myth & Mistake-17: Beware from 30-day toppers, 15-day toppersThis is the most common way of advertisement. Become a topper in 30 days or 15 days. It’s hilarious. This is a perfect example of fraud marketing. The CAT/GMAT is an IQ test. Only Asterix magic potion can do it and nothing else.Myth & Mistake-18: You can deceive GMAT Computer Adaptive AlgorithmPlease do not try. GMAC has evolved a test which cannot be deceived. Every question can carry you “Up” and throw you “Down”. Each question is important and has the same value as others do.One more myth is when a student believes that difficult questions carry more marks. And easy questions weightage is low. Do not read too much into any strategy. Work hard and it will show.One more mistake is trying to gauge your performance by counting correct questions out of total. This is the reason why the GMAC computer algorithm is difficult to copy.If you see easy questions, you are not doomed. It does not necessarily mean that your test is not going well.Myth & Mistake-19: Quantitative is important, Engineers have an advantageEngineers do not have any advantage in this test. Rather, they are at a disadvantage because their strength (Quant.) does not have substantial weightage. I have seen many students crossing 700 with 40 in quant and Q40 can be achieved by more than 80% of the test givers.Myth & Mistake-20: I am good in English, verbal will be kids playVerbal is not English, verbal is all about IQ. The only portion of the grammar it touches is SC. But the way CAT/GMAT tests your grammar is more based on IQ rather than grammar rules. SC is more about identifying the wrong choices rather than the correct one. It depends upon how easily you can see 2-3 splits and apply logic to find the correct answer.In CAT/GMAT, there is no perfect answer, you must mark the “Most” correct answer. There might not be any perfect answer in the five choices.Your choices should be based on your experience and how a help will help you cover your shortcomings. I found EduShastra customized approach much better than others. I also found their teachers dedicated to their students.","I'll tell you step by step how you should study to get 99.9 percentile in CAT,now you have around say 11 months to prepare. so CAT exam typically comprises of1.

The following explains it clearly.A total score of above 37+ is necessary to make it XLRI, Jamshedpur. Sectional Cut-off should be in the range ofVALR: 8-12DM: 9-10QADI: 10-11XAT 2017 GK focused more on Geography, but to do well in this section be up to date with everything happening around you (last 5-6 months), Economy, Personality and Awards, History etc.Essay Writing requires practice. Language, Grammar, Concept and Structure is very important. Spend about 20 mins on this section and write well.To achieve these sectional cut-offs:1. Be thorough with basics.2. Solve previous years papers to understand the kind of questions that come3. Focus more on the XAT exclusive questions, especially Decision Making. It is perceived as a subjective section and is therefore, tough.4. Take sectional tests. This will help you understand which your strong section is and which area to improve. This will help you know which section gives you a competitive edge.5. Take mocks. Learn to analyse each mock properly. One must know their strong and weak areas and work on them with dedication.http://catking.in/xat-mocks/6. Let’s not make random guesswork. It is only going to reduce your score. If you see a question, and you have no idea at all, LEAVE IT. If you feel you can do it but end up wasting more than 2 minutes then KEEP YOUR EGO ASIDE and move to the next one!7. Towards the end increase the rate of taking mocks.8. For Verbal section, read the Editorials of newspapers. This will help for Essay writing too. The following video will give you a few insights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...9. General Awareness is a scary section for most. Make wise choices.

Clearing Sectional cut-off is mandatory.Staying calm and composed is the most important ingredient to achieve 99%.All the Best!!","I scored 99.7+ three times (XAT 2011-2013). Trust me when I say this -once get a hang of how the test works, you don't need much preparation. However your basics need to be strong, especially in language.Your XAT score is more about how you handle the three hours of the test than how much you have prepared over the last year.I'll try to make this concise. You'll need the following.A good vocabulary & reading comprehension. Learn to read fast. Learn new words every day. This takes time to build, but once you have, half your work  is done. XAT questions(even quant questions) use a lot more 'language'  than the other B-School entrance tests.Speed. One needs to be able to solve 90 problems in 2-2.5 hours. Believe me, each one of those is a ten minute problem. Your best allies in this area are: Confidence, speed reading, and ability to do fast mental math, especially approximations. The second and third are obvious, but where confidence comes in is- you might have the fastest brain in the whole world, but if you keep re-checking your answers to be sure, trust me you're going nowhere with XAT. Plus, confidence helps you take risks. You'll need that too. Make educated guesses. Eliminate options, and if it comes down to one out of two, guess. Odds are still in your favour. Attempt as many as you can. I had over 90% attempts in all the years. Make sure you're attacking the test, not defending yourself in the examination hall. Stay calm. Never panic. A little adrenalin is okay, but stay calm. Breathe, do yoga/pranayam/tai chi or whatever shit you need to do, but get your shit together. Do not fuss too much over one question or section. Manage your time well.Be good. Be honest. Do the right thing. See both sides of any story. Be mature. Remember ""for the greater good"". Aaand you'll be through the dreaded decision making. XAT is tuned towards selecting a certain kind of people(rather, people with certain kind of thinking). And for a bloody good reason. And again, always move fast. That's all I can think of now.I'll update if I can think of anything else.PS: The thing about XAT is that everyone thinks it is difficult. And that's exactly why its easy to crack.","I got 99.18 in XAT 2014. Here are few things I did.My CAT didn't go that great so I was pretty crestfallen before writing XAT that year. However in that duration of two months I gave two mock XATs and went through the solutions of all previous year Decision making questions. Believe me it helps a lot to know the approach for solving DM questions. 90% times the answer to the decision making question is something you feel is ethically correct and is very true in an ideal world. Also for Quant there is no requirement for mugging up of formulas. You need to be fast with putting numbers in the question for hit and trial. Just approach every question in a very elementary fashion. Don't even try to use heavy fundas , just focus on basics. For verbal , practice previous years questions and be very quick in reading passages and other short questions.Furthermore, on the test day I did the following:I was very fast in reading all questions. I have a poor concentration level so i switch sections in every 10-15 mins to optimise my ability. Additionally, I always attempt short questions first. For Decision making i always go for 100%attempt. Believe me it helps a lot, as this section is fun and all you need to do is to just read coolly and tick the answer considering yourself the most moral person on this planet Earth :P . Coming to the Quant part I always attempt short questions with least number of lines first. I sieve out those questions in which I find the scope of replacing options to get the answer. I rarely attempt DI part because they are way too much time taking. Remember in quant even if your going for low attempts but if have high accuracy you are good to go. I generally have 100% accuracy so i don't go for unnecessary attempts. All in all , just stay calm on the test day and don't ever consider the paper as your life. It is just an exam which is a matter of the day.","Thanks A2aIf one follow proper strategy and study material then it is easy to score good percentile in MBA entrance exams. XAT exam is prestigious entrance exam for MBA candidates after CAT.These are important strategies to score the 99 percentile inXAT:1. Take coaching and as well as do the self-study: Take the coaching from the best coaching center and then do the self-study also. Because cracking the XAT/ CAT exam without proper preparation is almost impossible and most of the candidates have cracked the XAT/ CAT examination without the coaching also but the only difference is the dedication and the hard work and the self-study. These three play an important role in cracking the XAT/ CAT examination.Self-study plays an important role to get an edge on others, to self study you need some notes so that you can understand and revise things in short period of time.If you are doing self study only without joining coaching center then you can go for CAT/ XAT exam Study material, this set contains various pdf of some well known books and Notes. But if you didn`t need complete set then you will surely go for Full Mathematics Study Material.2. Never take the negative things into the mind because cracking the CAT/ XAT examination is not that tough but if you start thinking that the examination is tough and is difficult to crack then this will be a big blunder. You cannot go ahead with this thinking. So first make yourself sure that you can crack the examination and then start preparing for the examination at this stage only you can see the speed of solving the questions and the accuracy in you.3. In order to get the 99+ percentile in the CAT/ XAT examination you have to give equal importance to all the sections this is important because if you are scoring 99+ percentage marks in one section and in the another section such as the data interpretation you are scoring 60 percentage marks then this will create a problem for you in scoring the 99+ percentile in the CAT/ XAT examination so just concentrate on each and every section.4. Take mock tests: Based on the mock test result only your performance in the CAT/ XAT examination can be assumed because these mock tests give the accurate result of the level of speed of solving the questions and the accuracy. And your only duty is to analyze yourself and then start finding your weak areas and then start working on it. In this way, you can analyze your preparation and where you are lagging.5. Find tricks to solve questions easily: Even though they are providing the calculators in the CAT/ XAT Exam candidates should not depend on the calculators for each and every question and the calculation part they should learn some shortcut tricks in order improve the speed of solving the questions in many coaching centers they will teach you the important and easy shortcut tricks. So in order to get proper time management and the accuracy these tricks are more important.Finally, follow the above strategies properly in order to get 80+ percentile score in the CAT/ XAT examination. The tricks and the speed of solving the questions in the examination can be obtained just by practicing the more number of question papers and also solving the different models of questions in the important topics.Source- CAT/ MAT/ XAT: Strategy to Score 99 Percentile"
CAT,How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-did-99+-percentilers-prepare-for-CAT,"Prepathon, Exam and Test Results, Common Admission Test Percentiles, Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",100+,"My authority on the subject? I scored a 99.75 percentile in CAT, 99.55 in XAT, 99.45 in SNAP. This is a walkthrough of my preparation/ how you can go about preparing for CAT and other entrance exams.CAT is considered to be one of the most difficult entrance exams in India, but it is isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most of the topics that are tested in CAT are High school level topics. The difficulty lies in the fear of the test. Most CAT aspirants resign to an assumption that they can’t score above a certain percentile without even knowing what the test is made off, half the game is lost at this point.I have been guilty of the same myself. Jan 2016, I remember looking at lists of MBA colleges and immediately rejecting the top 30 odd colleges for the fact that they all required you to score above 97 percentile or so to realistically make into those colleges. It was only when I talked to my father and he explained to me the negativity in my thinking, that I realised, I hadn’t even seen what CAT consisted of. I had no logic in leaving out the possibility of scoring an extremely high percentile.Another reason why I felt that I had to score an extremely high percentile were my 12th class marks. MBA colleges give weightage to academic profile. A self-analysis made me realise that having a low score in my 12th class (69%) was a huge handicap. If I had got a low percentile I would’ve found it extremely difficult to make into the colleges of the relevant level. I would’ve ended up in colleges ranked even lower. I had to score a 99+ percentile. BELIEVE you can Crack the CATHow to go about:I have divided the preparation for CAT into four parts:Pre-preparation, Preparation, Practice, Taking the CATPre-PreparationThere are a few things you’ll want to have in place before you start your preparation for CAT and other exams.Find three hours a day (not in bits and pieces here and there) three continuous hours to prepare. This can be extremely difficult if you are working/ attending college. This might help you to find a few extra hours a day.Get rid of any distractions that you believe affect your concentration or mental state in general. (social media is one of the biggest time-suck and tends to distract you even if you aren’t online)Get in touch with someone who has cracked the entrance exam or has some expertise in the same, you could approach a local coaching centre. (you may not enrol as a full-time student but you would want to be in touch with the faculty there by buying their material or tests etc.) This will be helpful in getting certain finner tips and in case you have difficulties.Get yourself a campaign manager. Cracking the CAT and getting an admission into an MBA college is a long drawn process. You are bound to lose interest or forget important things/ deadlines. Get someone who will keep track of the same. For me, it was my father who helped me keep track of my preparation and all the college applications. Make sure the person you chose exactly understands the process and understands what you want. They will make sure that you are still going even when the motivation starts to run out.Read a lot. This is extremely important when it comes to the verbal ability section of CAT. You will need a lot of broad-based readings and an ability to make sense of what you have read quickly. The passages for reading comprehension in CAT are sometimes extremely abstract and can be extremely difficult to make sense if you aren’t used to reading a lot. Places where you should want to read from: Medium, The guardian, Businessweek Bloomberg, Also read some classic novels that you can lay your hands on, the books talked about on crash course literature are a good place to start.PreparationCAT is divided into 3 sections verbal ability reading comprehension, logical reasoning data interpretation, and quantitative ability. Each of the sections requires equal effort and attention.Time for preparation: There are many people and sites who will tell you that you need 14 hours a day to prepare for CAT. Trust me that doesn’t work. You just need 3 to 4 hours a day consistently over a period of 3- 4 months to crack CAT. Anything more than 5 hours a day can and will burn you out.Source material for preparation: A common mistake that most aspirants will make is relying on just one book/ one source for preparation (particularly anyone who takes coaching). It is recommended that you have access to at least some material from different authors. This will provide you with multiple points of view for the same problems. (same goes for mock tests recommended that take at least 4 to 5 tests from A differen source).Verbal Ability & Reading ComprehensionThis is one of the most frustrating sections in CAT. The question often can seem to have multiple solutions and where options are provided all of them seem correct. Even if you are extremely good with English you can end up messing this section.The key to cracking this section (particularly Verbal ability part) is understanding that this section is more about logic than language. You have to understand the logic as to how the solutions are arrived at (jumbled para is the killer in this section).I initially worked this section by looking at the solutions, that way I was able to see what patterns to look out for and what logic to apply.Work on improving your ability to comprehend complex /long sentences, particularly from topics that you aren’t used to and having complex vocabulary.This section will take a lot of practice to master, more practice than the other two sections. This section has the highest returns for scores. If you get a slightly higher score in this section your percentile can increase drastically. (I scored a 99.98 percentile in this section).Even if you have a good command over the language DO NOT take this section lightly, I know of aspirants who have the CAT along with me having excellent command over the language yet messing up this section completely.Data interpretation and logical reasoningData interpretation is a practice intensive section. There is nothing new that you have to learn in this section. It is just the ability to carry out basic calculations using tools you already have (percentages, averages, summation, division). Practice these basic tools thoroughly so that you are extremely comfortable with them. Also get acquainted with all the various forms of data presentation, such as graphs, pie charts, tables, caselets etc.Logical reasoning is a section which you should and can make the most out of it. The questions are very often similar. While practising logical reasoning the things you would want to learn is gauging the difficulty of the question quickly. If a question is difficult, move on to the next one (time is important).You would want to practice visualising the problem (in mind / on paper ) in the simplest way possible. This will help you breakdown huge paragraphs full of seemingly meaningless words into sensible data.Learn to have an unbiased mind. One of the mistakes you can make in this section is assume somehting that isnt true. Learn to use all the information provided and only than make any conclusion.Read the data carefully a single word can change the whole situation. (for ex. XYZ is not wearing a black pant. can easily be mistaken for XYZ wearing a pant if you miss out on the not.)Quantitative abilityThis is one of the more easier sections to get by, You just have to understand the concepts behind all the topics involved. Again the topics in this section are high school level math. You can over prepare for this section and most aspirants do.There are certain topics in this section that you would want to be extremely thorough with since they appear most frequently (going by the trends of past so many years), such as time speed distance, time work, Geometry, Functions.You would want to also be thorough with averages alligations, percentages ratios since these topics are more helpful in DI section but very rarely make an appearance as stand-alone questions in QA section.Number systems personally I felt for me was an extremely overrated topic ( I spent way more time than required here)PracticeTaking mock tests, I feel mock tests will be the most important part of your preparation as they help you guage exactly where you stand. (another benefit is to know which colleges you should apply to).What is a good number of mock tests to take? There isn’t any concensus on this topic, there are CAT toppers who got by on hardly any mock tests, and than there are people like me who took close 40 mock tests.Personally mock tests where the biggest source of practice for me. I took mock tests from 3 different sources. ( I recommend atleast 2 different sources). Once you have taken a mock test it’s extremely important that you analyse them well, I spent about an hour and half after every mock test to analyse where I have gone wrong and what can be changed. Mock tests are also a good time to test out strategies in handling various sections. (I will try to come with a detailed post about analysing mock tests.)I will boast a little here, but thanks to the trends on my mock tests I was extremely confident of getting the percentile I got on CAT. ( I expected at least a 99.5 %le)I recommend practicing during the time slot you will actually be answering the CAT, I had to take the CAT on a sunday in the morning slot (9.30 to 12.30) at a centre 30 kms away from home. Considering the reporting time of an extra hour, I would have to technically leave my house at 7 in the morning on the day of the test. I usually get hungry within 2 and half hours of eating anything. So in the month before CAT I trained my body, by having breakfast at 6 in the morning and not having anything till 1pm. I also trained myself to sit at one place for 4 hours (830 to 1230). This may seem funny/ unnecessary but on the day of the test you dont want to have any other factors troubling you.Taking the CATTry to stop preparation for CAT at least 3 days before CAT (there are people who will disagree and reccommend you remain in the mood and keep preparing) anything you try to “prepare” during these last days often will be of very little help. Don’t wander away from the CAT mood though, read or at least make sure you are sitting 3 hours at a place for these last few days ( to stay in the CAT mood).Do not take a mock test in the few days before CAT, If you mess the mock it is likely that you will panic on the day of the CAT.Do not keep any expectations as to the number of questions you want to complete in each section.All the best for your preparation for CAT.P.S. CAT isn’t everything, CAT is hardly a learning experience, you won’t learn anything new as such (well other than how to prepare hard) it’s mostly about things you already know, taking the CAT can hence be a very frustrating experience. I recommend that you learn something else too on the side lines, get a hobby or hold a job (again debatable as to how much time you can find etc.) If you are taking drop read a lot, read all the books you can get your hands on. All in all try to do something else too that will help you grow.Belling the CAT and other entrance exams","This answer is fairly long, about 7000 words. So I have divided my answer into 9 parts wherein each part can be read independently. However reading the entire answer in one go will serve as RC practice, so that would be advisable.What I have mentioned below helped me in my journey from 66% -> 99.85% in CAT. I have tried my level best to be as detailed as possible. GK as a section is not there in CAT as of now but is very important in the other papers like XAT, IIFT, SNAP, etc. So, I have included that as well. I have also put in a little bit about how to attempt mocks and then analyse them to improve further. A little bit on GD-PI-WAT as well, so that this answer serves all your needs.I would like to point out that I have been an average student all my life and am a GEM (General Engineer Male), yes pun intended. My 10/12/B.Tech scores are 83/79/66. With that I made it to IIM Calcutta, so the first thing that you should now do is stop worrying about your previous grades. 99% of the people reading this will surely have better grades. So, if I can you obviously can get through and study at an IIM.My CAT 2015 score card:QA: 99.8%LRDI: 99.96%VA: 87.33%OA: 99.85%This answer is divided into the following parts:A.) How to start?B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityC.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningD.) VA -> Verbal AbilityE.) GK -> General KnowledgeF.) How to attempt mocks? (Non-CAT exams at the end)G.) How to analyse mocks?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?I.) GD-PI-WAT prepA.) How to start CAT prep?Register at any site which lets you attempt and review a mock for free. You could try hitbullseye. If you have already enrolled for a test series or for a classroom programme, then attempt one of their mocks. Many of you would be like bhai abhi toh padhai start bhi nahi ki, mock deke kya hoga aur upar se aadhe questions toh samajh bhi nahi aayenge aur maths ke formula bhi yaad nahi hain. Additionally while attempting the mock, there will be multiple instances when you will feel like getting up because you are not used to solving questions for 3 hours at a stretch. Your brain will also try to deceive you into grabbing your smart phone for checking Whatsapp. You will feel like drinking water, you will also be tempted to check FB. The point of this test is to make sure that all this doesn’t happen when you actually attempt CAT. Now you would be thinking what is the point in attempting a mock when I don’t know $hi+.Precisely my point! The main reason for this mock was to identify what you know, what you don’t, where you stand and how much hard work is required.Once you are done with the mock, check the solutions and find the topics which you already know, which you attempted correctly. Some problems would have been there which you would have been sure of but you got them wrong because you were out of touch and forgot the formula or recalled an incorrect formula. You probably forgot the plural of fish. Fish or fishes? Or does it depend on whether I am talking about a species of fish or multiple units of the same species? Then you will realise that a little brush up of a few topics (which you are out of touch with) will dramatically improve your score. Work on these topics first and then move on to topics which you have no clue about. This mock decides your future course of study.Now, on to the preparation phase.B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityStart off with this site. http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/Click on start and then check your score. You know where you stand. Keep practising a few times every day and your score will keep improving. If you can hit 50-55 consistently in the default 120 seconds, you will easily hit 99.5% in CAT in this section. If you are targeting 99.5+ then I would also like you to memorise the following:B1.) Reciprocals, Squares and Cubes up till 30. Pay attention here, some values will get repeated. As for 1/7. Remember that it is .142857. For other go up to 2-3 decimals,whatever you are comfortable with. I would prefer 3 decimals though.B2.) Power of 2 up till 12Power of 3 up till 8Power of 4 up till 6Power of 5-6 up till 5Power of 7-10 up till 4Power of 11-13 up till 3Again same as above. Some values will be the same. 4^6 has already been covered till 2^12 and so on. Don’t just mug up blindly, pay attention to the numbers.B3.) Square Root up till 10B4.) Factorial up till 10B1-B4: Now most of you would be like, dude they give an inbuilt calculator. But then other exams don’t have that calculator. Additionally who do you think will take lesser time in solving a question? A person who uses the calculator for finding 12^3 or someone who just knows it is 1728. Believe me when I say that this is very important for your LRDI section as well. This will decide whether you get stuck at 99.5% or go beyond that. This is the deciding factor. Please memorise these values.B5.) A few important numbers like 999=27*37, 1001=7*11*13, 21^3=9261.B6.) Some numbers have the property wherein the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the no itself. 1, 2, 145 and 40585. Please remember these.B7.) There are 15 primes till 50, 25 till 100, 46 till 200 and 168 till 1000.B8.) How to find the sum of the first n natural nos. Sum of squares of n natural nos. Sum of cubes, sum of 4th powers. Please remember the formulas. Specially the last one (fourth power), most people forget that.B9.) Scale is not allowed in any of the exams. What the CAT authorities mean is that the scale which we used back in school that is not allowed. They never said anything about using your hand as a scale. Check the length of your fingers. Also check the length of the 3 sub division on your fingers. Use your right or left hand, whatever suits you. Please make sure that you remember these values by heart. These values will help you solve 90% of the geometry questions. Also, buy a protractor and make sure you can make the angles 30, 45, 60, 90 properly. First with the protractor and then without it. Based on the question, make a rough figure. Then based on your lengths, find the answer and then scale up to the value given in the question. Geometry has a lot of formulas, memorize them or use this approach. Approximation ftw!B.10.) Unitary Method. Make sure you are good with this, half the QA syllabus can be solved using unitary method. Do you think whatever has been mentioned in B9 is basically Unitary Method at the end for getting the answer?Most of the students go for solving the maximum no of problems. Don’t do that. Focus on the basics, don't go for solving questions directly like most students. Most students don’t score 99+. You are different, work differently. This is how you should be doing it for any given chapter day wise. First day go after the formulas and try to understand why a certain formula is there. Make sure that you have memorised all the formulas for that chapter. If you were to set the paper, what could be a possible question? Read a formula, try to frame questions on that formula and then memorize the formula. Just memorizing all formulas in one go won't help, because you will probably forget. If you can do this, then you would have solved all the questions by the time you finish reading the theory.Example: Let's say you are studying Numbers. You see the formulas for HCF and LCM of 2 nos. Then you see the factors of a number. Now think of possible questions on this. Let's say 72.1.) How many odd factors are there?2.) How many even factors are there?3.) What is the sum of the odd factors?4.) What is the sum of the even factors?5.) What is the product of the odd factors?6.) What is the product of the even factors?7.) How many factors are squares of natural numbers?8.) How many factors are cubes of natural numbers?Good going, you just completed half the chapter! Similarly think of more questions that you can make. The exercise at the end is filled with such questions. It depends on your thinking. Focus on this. If basics are fine,questions won't be a problem.Would you memorize 456*876 and 235*9865 and things like that or learn how multiplication works?If you think that you lack imagination when it comes to maths and can’t do the above, then no problem. As mentioned above, by the end of the first day you would be done with memorising all the formulas. That’s it. Don’t solve anything. Just make sure all the formulas are deeply rooted in your brain and you can recall them anytime you want. Now take a break for a day. On the 3rd day, start solving problems. But remember that you are to solve by recalling the formula not by turning over the pages and looking at the formula. If you cannot recall, then please make sure you memorize the formulas again. Solve a few problems. Take a day’s break and continue solving on the 5th and similarly on the 7th day as well. This way apart from the formula getting imprinted in your brain multiple times, you will also understand which formulas are asked more often than others. Some chapters are connected to one another. Make groups of such chapters. If working on a group, try to complete all the topics in that group. For example:Ratio Proportion, Unitary Method, Percentage, Profit and Loss.Simple equations, Simultaneous equations, Inequalities, Time speed distance and work, Quadratic.Progression.Numbers, Bases, Miscellaneous equations.Surds and Indices, Logarithms.Mensuration.Geometry.Coordinate Geometry.Probability and PnC.Functions and Graphs.For people trying to clear the cut off in this section. The first 3 with mensuration and a bit of geometry/numbers will be enough.C.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningData Interpretation is speed and practise. The site mentioned in the Quant region and B1-B4 there would be of immense help. These will increase your speed. Generally each and every DI set has at least a problem on percentage or ratio.Today when you start, start off with the sole intention of solving all the questions of a given set. When you can do that on a daily basis. Move to 2 sets a day. When you can do that. Move to 3 sets daily and then to 4 sets. Keep solving as many questions as you can. Time taken per question will decrease with practise. A few months after you were born, you started to crawl, then you started walking and finally you started running. Same thing here. Don’t think about speed now. Speed comes gradually. Let nature take its course.Logical Reasoning, as the name suggests is based on how well you can interpret and analyse things. LR checks your thought process, it checks how you tackle problems. Get this book ""Puzzles"" by George J. Summers. When you watch a football match, why do you watch it? Probably because you want your team to win or you want to see a good contest and enjoy. Similarly, once you have bought this book, think about your objective. It’s not about getting the correct solution, it’s about improving your thought process. And additionally the puzzles in this book are tough. You could think of it as the daddy of Irodov. Engineers will get the joke! You won’t be able to solve most of the problems and frankly speaking I don’t expect you to. However, what I do expect from you is to read a question. Try to understand what has been given. Try to understand what is being asked. Think about it for say 10-15 minutes. Write down whatever approach you can think of. If you could not solve it, look at the hints and their solution scheme. Were you thinking in the right direction?Analyse the difference between the method given in the book and your method.Try to understand what you missed because of which you could not solve the puzzle. Try again for 30 minutes. If you can solve it, good enough, if not maybe try again. After a few more tries look at the solution. Remember you bought the book to improve your thought process, not to solve each question in the first attempt. Trying a puzzle for 5 minutes and then looking at the solution will take you nowhere. Solving again and again till the time you get the answer is what the book was bought for. To make sure that you can think and get the answer on your own. The answer at the end is just for verification. 1-2 puzzles a day. 3 at max, not more than that. You have to improve your thought process,not complete the book as fast as possible. Your scores in the LR section will improve in a month’s time and then it will stay at 99%.Another very important point would be to memorize the alphabet-number conversion table. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. You will come across questions on this in your mocks as well as in the exams.D.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI had 69 and 72 in English in 10 and 12 respectively. My verbal score in CAT went up from 43 -> 87%. Whatever I have written below is what I did to make sure that I cleared the verbal cut off comfortably. If you are looking at a 99+verbal score, then you would be better off by reading the other answers to this question for improving your verbal section. This part is not for you kindly move on to the LRDI section. If you however $uck at English just like me, then this just might help you in clearing the sectional cut off. I tried memorizing words from the GRE word list. My language skills were not good enough to use words like persiflage, perspicuous, ubiquitous, scintillating, etc. in sentences. So, I would keep memorizing and then keep forgetting these words. I had never read novels so I had never come across such words as well. So, I came to the conclusion that memorising words won’t help me. But, a decent vocabulary is needed for CAT. So, I bought this book “Word Power Made Easy” by Normal Lewis. Managed to complete the chapters in a few months. I didn’t do the word list at the end. I would request you to buy this book and complete the chapters.Another thing that seemed obvious to me was that whether you look at RCs or Para Jumbles or Para Completion or Para Summary. All these have basically been written by some person who had a very good command over the English language. So all these things should logically have a flow of thought with which the author would have written the entire thing. You just have to understand that flow. If you can understand an RC, then understanding a paragraph from that RC will obviously be very easy for you. Think about it, a PJ or a PC or a PS are basically paragraphs taken from an RC. You just have to understand the flow in which the entire thing was written by some person who had a decent understanding of the English language. But, then I again had a problem. The Verbal section in CAT was supposed to be of 1 hour and as soon as I would start reading an RC, 8-10 minutes down the line I would feel drowsy. I would start thinking about checking FB or Whatsapp or practically doing anything apart from reading that stupid RC. All those Speed reading techniques, skimming, reading the question first and all. None of that mattered. I understood what my problem was. COMPREHENSION and CONCENTRATION. By the time I was in the 2nd para I would have forgotten what was written in the 1st para. It’s called a READING COMPREHENSION for a reason. Never trade comprehension for speed.How to improve comprehension and concentration?Both will improve gradually with time. First step is to make sure that you don’t feel drowsy when reading for an hour. You will be required to do that in the exam. So you need to build your stamina to concentrate. Start off by reading 2-3k word long articles on News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian. Register on the website and you will get a mail every morning at 10am. Read all the articles from there. Make sure you read at a stretch for an hour. Read everything from Culture to Technology to Art to Literature. In the beginning you will feel sleepy within a few minutes of starting. Slowly you will gain rhythm. Within 15 days you will be able to read 1 hour at a stretch. In a month’s time you will start retaining information as well. Then focus on just 1 category every day. Like only Philosophy or only Art or only culture. With that your stamina and concentration will increase further and since you are reading about only 1 thing for 1 hour, your knowledge in that topic will also increase. This can be done at home, but preferably in office to better utilize your time. PJ PC PS are all extensions of an RC. All will seem easy once you are comfortable with RCs. Here News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian you will be reading 2000-3000 word long articles. Once you are used to this, 500-600 word passages in CAT and other exams will be a piece of cake for you!For verbal, always eliminate choices and then mark rather than directly trying to find the correct answer. This section is different from the other sections,so it has to be dealt in a different manner. Please eliminate choices and then answer. If in doubt, leave. As for the grammar section, I have no idea when to use have and when to use has. Same with is/are and things like that. Neither can I spot grammatical errors in sentences. So, I mostly leave such questions.But I always read them. You can always answer a few of them based on instinct. Some sitters are always there in every paper.E.) GK -> General KnowledgeAll the papers except CAT have this section. Some have a sectional cut off,some don’t. This section can be answered in about 5 minutes. It has the highest marks/min for any section. This section is the key to a high percentile. This section will give you the points for speaking in a GD and PI and also for writing in WAT. So, if you plan on getting through to a good B-School don’t ignore it. There would be 2 methods to prepare for this.E1.) Start reading any newspaper. Go through the headlines and all. Make sure you are updated with what is happening in the country. After a week or so, you will realise that it’s mostly the same thing that keeps getting repeated everyday in the paper. Think of it from the point of view of the exam. There will be MCQs. So they won’t ask for your opinion on Kejriwal vs Modi. Leave all the pages on politics. That’s sheer wastage of time. Don’t waste time on that stuff! Make sure you remember the schemes which Mr Modi keeps rolling out. At least remember the important ones. Did any big firm buy another one? Any Indian who won some award abroad. Who won which Grand Slam? Who won the Pulitzer Prize? Who won the Arjuna Khel Ratna Award? India is working on the Chabahar port with which country? Malcom Turnbull is from which country? I think you would have understood what is expected from you. MBA is about business. Focus on economic and business news more than others. Noble Prize in economics fort his year? How many Deputy Governors are there in the Reserve Bank? Make a doc file with these details. You file would look somewhat like this.https://docs.google.com/document...This is what I had made for this year, so no this won’t help you! You will have to make one with the current affairs of this year. Since you will be working the entire year making this, so by the time the exams are a week away, you will have such a file. You might however think that this is too much work. In that case I would suggest you try the second and relatively easier method compared to this.E2.) Whichever is the first exam for you which will have a GK section, keep 4 days before that exam for making this file and memorizing it. Gather all the monthly booklets which are given to Time students. Each book has about 100 questions. Memorize the ones you think are important. CL and Time both will also have a few sheets on GK, current affairs, etc. Get those as well. CL GK compendium. Hitbullseye gk pdfs are also there. You can get most of these online for free or search on Pagalguy, someone would have uploaded it there for sure. Whatever you think is important, please memorize that. 4 days is more than enough to complete all the material I have mentioned above. By going through the monthly magazines you will also be able to keep track of what is happening in India and also round the globe.The regular reading (The first method, reading daily) means that when the exam sare about to start, you would have completed most of the things. The last 4 days will serve as a revision for you. I did both the above things. So if you have time go for it. A close friend of mine, Prateek, he was preparing for UPSC. He was of immense help! Whenever I would meet him, we would talk about how things going on in our country. Served as revision for him and I would stay updated with facts. So, if you can find someone who is preparing for UPSC religiously,i t would be great. You will also have a contact who is an IAS officer. If you want to score even higher in GK get a small yearbook from some shop. Small ones general contain 100 odd pages, going through that will serve as revision as well.F.) How to attempt mocks (Non-CAT exams at the end)The first step here is to make sure that you can sit and concentrate properly for 3 hours at a stretch. FB, Whatsapp, drowsiness, drinking water or the sudden urge to go to the washroom during these 3 hours have to be removed.Kindly take care of such things which might disturb you, especially the last 2 and then start a mock. When you are attempting the mock, the only thing in your mind should be about maximising your score! Another point that you should keep in mind in that no one cares about what you know and what you don’t. The only thing that matters is your score. So please keep your ego aside when attempting the paper. Yeh question kaise nahi bana, kal hi toh banaya tha and then you spend the next 15 mins on it and still end up marking the wrong answer. Please don’t! You have a fight with your girlfriend and then you are like “I am not texting her first”. Yes I was talking about that very ego of yours, please get rid of it when you are attempting a mock. If you can’t solve a question then please move on to the next one. The examination hall is not the place to derive a formula and then solve the concerned problem. Anyways, I could go on but I think I have made my point.Remember that half the paper is very easy, mostly formula based. Your approach should be to attempt these questions first. Make sure that you have touched the 97-98% mark and then move on to the difficult questions for improving your score.F1.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityYou are not supposed to start from question no 1 and then continue till 34. Most of the times you will not even be able to look at some of the problems in the end. So we will follow a Round by round approach. About 50% of the problems are direct formula based. When you start this section (Round 1), keep the above point in mind. So, as soon as you look at a question. Can you solve it in a minute by using a formula? If the question with a formula was given to a 5th grader, would he be able to solve it. If yes, then solve this question. Use the values given in the question, get the answer and then move on to the next question. If you see a question and you are like, yaar yeh toh banaya hua hai, 2-3 min lagega, lamba question hai. Or if you are like sirf cases likhne hain, phir count kar lunga, phir answer. Such questions which you know you can solve but are not direct formula based, are to be left out now. These have to be attempted in the 2nd round. Getting my point? If formula based, then attempt else next. Within 30 minutes you should have attempted about 16-17 questions and you would have seen all the questions. That will get you at least 97-98% in this section.Now Round 2, there were a few questions which you had seen earlier and were pretty confident about. This is where your brain will help you. The human mind is so awesome that even though you just looked at it once but solved different questions and totally forgot about it, you brain was working on that question subconsciously without you having any idea about it. Now, when you read the question, you will take a lesser amount of time to solve it compared to what you would have taken had you solved it in the first round itself. You could go for Round 3 as well, your choice! But 2 rounds are needed. Please stop with a single round method which most of you are used to now.Why this approach?Many people are most often not able to see the entire paper,so they miss sitters. This round by round technique helps you go through the entire paper and thereby select the easiest ones which in turn maximises your score. You won’t get a prize if you solve a question that only 10 students out of 2 lac could solve. The marks per question is the same. Since you solve the easier problems first, the chances of your committing mistakes goes down considerably. A question which you have solved but incorrectly is not wasted time and only a -1 for your score. Instead of 3 you get a -1. So such a question effectively hits you with lost time and a -4. This method reduces the no of such questions. Hence, this approach.F2.) DILR -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningIf you have tried solving the book which I had mentioned above, you would by now have a fair idea about how to make a table for solving LR problems. 5 people, 5 countries, 5 cars, 5 pets. All of us have solved such puzzles,haven’t we? You would obviously have 4 columns but which would be the first and which would be the second, etc. That determines how fast you will be able to solve the set. Oh, you thought it didn’t make a difference? It does! Sometimes you are better off soling set theory problems by a table. This is where your practise and experience comes into play. Making the proper table means half the work is done then and there. You just have to put in the values and tick mark the correct answers now.Now about how to attempt. When you start the section, go through the 4 LR sets.1-2 sets will be very easy. Take a couple of minutes and try to identify the easier ones. Look at the questions. Do you see any question wherein it asks how many cases are possible or questions of that sort? Such sets are to be solved at the end. Look for sets wherein directly by looking at the questions, you know that there is one unique solution. Use the answer options to further reduce your time for soling that set. Now start with such sets. First advantage of this method will be that you will feel good, because you will be done with a couple of sets in 10-12 minutes. Additionally you will be in a flow and your chances of cracking a difficult set will go up. Now compare this to the case when you start the section, and think that looking at all the questions means losing a few minutes. I am James Bond, so I will start with the first set. 10 minutes later you haven’t completed a single question and now for the remaining 50 minutes you will keep thinking, yaar 10 min faaltu mein barbaad ho gaye. Good luck solving that section and the next with such a mind-set.Many a time it will happen that the set you picked up, is going nowhere and yet time is passing on. For such sets, wherein you have already spent 4-5 minutes but haven’t been able to mark even a single question. Please leave that set.You might be tempted to think sirf 2 min aur, aur phir 4 questions ban jayenge. Please don’t commit that mistake. 5 minutes is the threshold in which you should have been able to mark at least 2 questions. Worst case scenario 1. If you are at 0. Please move on. You are better off solving that set later on,preferably at home!Same with DI sets, go through the sets, select the easier ones, and complete them. You will be left off with 2 sets. Again with 2 options, it always easy to select the easier one. This way most of the times, you will end up solving the toughest set at the end or you will probably leave it. All questions have the same marks, so isn’t it better to solve easier ones? Additionally tougher problems will also take a toll on your brain, your effectiveness for the next section might go down. Do you want that to happen?Sometimes a set will be easy but a question in there will be extremely tough.Beware of such questions, these are put in place to derail your momentum. 5-7 minutes per set is what you should be looking at. Always look at the questions and attempt. You don’t have to attempt all questions from a set. Even 3 attempts for a set is fine. Again, you know the term that I am talking about!Keep that aside when attempting a mock.F3.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI get tired of reading and lose interest quickly. So RCs at the end seems a bad idea. So, I start off with RCs. Again as soon as you start this section. Glance through all the RCs in a minute and check if any of them is from a subject you like. Your reading speed and comprehension will be higher in this case. Again as mentioned above, just because you read an RC, doesn’t mean you have to attempt all the questions. Even 4 out of 6 questions from an RC is good enough. Just attempting for the sake of increasing attempts is sheer stupidity. Please don’t think ki aree yaar itne marks toh already aa hi rahe hain exam mein. Dusron ko thoda mauka de deta hun -2 leke. Please don’t do that. Eliminate options and then attempt. When in doubt leave. Move on to the single questions after the RCs.Note -> For non-CAT mocks which you attempt online.First and foremost thing is that apart from CAT, most are pen paper based, but at home you attempt online papers for these. Take a few print outs of the OMR sheet and check how many minutes you need for marking the answers. Keep a 5 min buffer for your safety. Let’s say we talk about IIFT. It’s a 2 hour paper in real. However I need 20 minutes just for marking the bubbles. So, there is absolutely no point in attempting the online paper at home for 2 hrs. Submit the test after 100 minutes. Don’t worry if people attempt for 2 hours and your rank is low. Your score in the main exam matters, not in this one. Similarly for SNAP and XAT as well. Form a basic strategy of how you would like to attempt the paper for the 100 minutes(whatever your time is after you have checked marking in the OMR sheet). Like for Snap, I had a strategy of 5-6 minutes for gk then 16-18 minutes for verbal, then 35-40 minutes for LR. Then maths and as soon as it would be 90 minutes after the start, I would mark all the answers. Then solve and again mark in the last 5 minutes. Similarly make your strategy for IIFT, SNAP, XAT, etc. and stick to it.G.) How to analyse mock?The instant you submit a mock, you will have a score in mind, itna toh banta hai. 1 sec later the page reloads and you see your score and you go, are yaar itne toh 2 section milake hi aa jane chahiye the. This is why analysing the mock is important. You knew a certain score was achievable but your score went down drastically because of silly mistakes. Analysing mocks will take care of such mistakes. Once the solutions and result for a mock are out. First of all check up all the problems which you couldn’t solve. That’s what you have to learn.Then look at the time taken by the topper in solving a question. Look at your time. Did you take 200 seconds whereas the topper took 30 seconds? That’s because there is a technique you don’t about. Learn that technique. Write it in your notebook where you write formulas. That was about identifying and learning things which the toppers know. You have to be one of them. Go through the mocks and find such methods. AdditionallyThen there will be a category of questions you were sure of but you somehow used your talent and got it wrong and after looking at the solution you are like aree yaar yeh koi kaise galat kar sakta hai. But as a matter of fact, you did! This will happen mostly in counting problems (Numbers). Even if you had 100 in English in 10 and 12 you will still come to know that you had been using some Grammar rule incorrectly or there is some exception you had no clue about. But, after a -4 you will remember them! You will sometimes come to know that a certain word which you have been using all your life can also be used in a totally different context. Thank You without an exclamation mark? Sarcasm! Oxymoron, alliteration, etc. Learn what these mean. Such mistakes will make sure you remember all these. Sometimes you will take the diameter as the radius and solve. Sometimes 2*3 will become 5 and sometimes 7*19 will become 114. Don’t rush through problems. The paper is set so as to give you enough time. Slow and steady wins the race.Then another section in the results shows the % of people who attempted a question and % of people who got it right. You are supposed to attempt the easy ones first, then the average difficulty questions. Finally attempt a few difficult ones or totally leave them out. Here you can check which questions you were supposed to attempt but didn’t. Also the questions which you were supposed to leave but being the Bond that you are, you nonetheless decided to attempt it thereby losing marks and giving others a chance to overtake you. If your family is worth billions of dollars, you could do that, but given that you are still reading this, I doubt it! So whenever you look at such questions, try to think about what was in your mind during the mock which made you do such a thing. Try not to commit the same mistake again.Yes, I agree all this will take more than 3 hours. Who told you getting into a good B-school was easy?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?The study material from the top 3 institutes namely Time, CL and IMS is mostly the same. I have seen and used it, so use whichever you want, it won’t make a big difference. A few new ones like Hitbullseye and test funda are also coming up. Haven’t used the material by these 2 so can’t comment. In terms of content the level of questions is higher in Time. I mean tougher questions here, so you are better prepared for CAT, but then you could also argue about why put in more effort than required. In CL, the theory and explanations for quant is way better that that in others. Theory for quant is literally non-existent in Time. IMS is good for verbal. As mentioned above, please use that book for LR and also that book for Verbal. I have not mentioned the names of the books, because if you scroll up and check you will then remember the name when you have to tell it to the shopkeeper! That LR book will help make a strong base for you and then completing the LR material from these institutes will give you practise and improve your skills further. For those who keep talking about Arun Sharma, please please please use proper material. Do you really think 1 book is good enough for your CAT preparation and others are stupid who go through all that? If you think you are smart enough and don’t need all that and 1 book is enough. Good Luck with CAT!Mocks basically tell you where you stand when compared to the toppers in the country. Time has the most no of people attempting its Aimcats. So having that is a must. Next in line, with the maximum no of people attempting the mocks would be CL. After that you have IMS, test funda and all. Aimcats are pretty tough when compared to actual CAT but are extremely important because it gives you a true picture of where you stand and how much more effort you need to put in. CL mocks are close to the CAT level especially in terms of quant. IMS mocks are close to CAT level in verbal. I would suggest Time + CL/IMS. You can however take all the 3 if you want. Or maybe some other institute’s mock series. It’s mostly about practise.The mock questions are mostly the same. It’s just the values that they keep changing every year. Same with the material. Whether you look at the material of this year or that of 5 years ago, you will realise that it’s mostly the same. So, you are better off buying old material from someone or from a secondhand book store. I have uploaded some mocks and some prep material. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...https://drive.google.com/open?id...I also found some useful material from total gadha. Here’s the link for thathttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...I.) GD-PI-WAT prepFrankly speaking, getting a score is easy. This is the tougher part. This requires more hard work because in here, you will be up against the best in the country. Most of the people attending the interviews will come prepared, so here your odds will be higher. So, please work hard for this. GDPI prep as such should be dealt with in a different question. So, won’t go into the details here, but just an over view of what is expected of you. If you had done the GK and current affairs part as mentioned above, you will be easily able to manage the WAT. You will also have ample of points for speaking in a GD. Similarly questions on current affairs in a PI will also be a piece of cake for you. What remains is the HR part. In here, you have to understand that you can guide the interview and you can force them to ask exactly what you have prepared. But that requires a little thinking. Tell me about yourself is a standard question which is used to initiate an interview. It is mostly followed by your strengths and weaknesses. The main thing here is that you have to try to make a story and link everything that you have done in your life till now with why you want to do an MBA. The interviewers are smart people, they have been doing this for years. They are extremely good at catching liars. So think this through well. This part of your prep needs your utmost dedication and hard work. Prepare your answers properly. It is really tough to explain how to prepare for GD-PI. You will be better off at some institute where someone can guide you individually. However, what I can still do is upload all the GDPI material that I have and share it with you. But do keep one thing in mind, this contains some files on the current affairs of 2015, so that will be of no use for you. The other stuff is pretty much relevant. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...I hope you convert your dream college. May the force be with you!","How ‘NOT’ To prepare for CAT/GMATOne of the most important strategy in CAT/GMAT is to find out the wrong choices to identify the right one. This post is dedicated to “Avoiding Mistakes” strategy.Myth & Mistake-1: Following the Herd. Choosing a help or any coaching because others are choosing itHumans belongs to Animal kingdom. If you have studied Biology, then this point will be easier to understand. In animal kingdom. Weak animals are always in herd but the strong one is solitary or always having small groups. Ever wondered Why??The answer lies in the mentality. A strong animal judges the situation and leads its life based on its experience but a weak animal actions are based upon others. If others are doing it, then it’s wise to do it. You can choose to be a Herd follower or to make your own paths.Never follow the group. A leader never follows. If you will move with a group, you will always be with them. If you will create your paths, then only you can beat others. Adding following lines from Robert Frost to add a dramatic touch:“Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”Myth & Mistake-2: Focusing on absolute number of Successful Candidates rather than Percentage.Most of the Institutes talks about the number of success stories but are silent on how many of their students were unsuccessful. Even their Advertisements talks about total number of students getting Interview call or final admits. But the real numbers are shocking, most of the Institutes have 2-3 % students getting expected result.But the magic is in numbers. Make people follow a Herd and even if 2-3% students are successful, the success numbers become substantial. The problem is that your chances of landing in the unsuccessful students group is 98%, but this data does not bother them because they know how to work upon the “Herd Mentality” of the population. Show them 2% success stories and make them follow a herd.Myth & Mistake-3: The Bigger the Better.I am referring to Class Strength. No teacher can teach a herd. If your batch size is more than 10-12 students, then you are not getting proper attention from a teacher. If the education company is claiming “Customized or Personalized” services, then the class size must be less than 10-12 students.Myth & Mistake-4: Going after a Brand or No.1 education companyAll Branded books are easily available in the market at very low-cost. A student joins any help or coaching to get a personalized teaching experience. A Teacher-Student relation is analogous to a Mother-Child relation. There is nothing called “No. 1 Mother”. Every mother is No. 1 for her Kids and the reason is her personalized attention.Rather than sitting in a large group with “No. 1”, you should aim for a personalized attention (We join any help for their teachers or their course offering).Myth & Mistake-5: Deciding after taking DemosAll Institutes stage their Demos. They are very carefully planned. The teacher is usually the teacher, who will not teach regularly. If anyone says “Book your demo” or guide you to a specific time, then it is staged. The best way is to ask them about their class timings and insist on sitting in the ongoing class. If you feel the focus is on you, then you are at the wrong place.Try to identify honest institutes. Honesty should be a very important deciding factor.Myth & Mistake-6: Choosing Institute which makes “Toppers” or just focuses on “Past Records”Never choose any institute if its marketing is focused on this fundamental. Keep your basics simple. Think what you want from it and focus on its delivery. You are there for education, not to hear its past stories.Institutes focus on this factor to take your attention away from their product. Your focus should only be on their product, their teachers, their teaching methodologies, their course structures, etc.Myth & Mistake-7: Jo Dikhta hai, Wo (Nahi) Bikta haiA good product needs no marketing. Weak products need marketing. Whenever you see lots of marketing effort, Google ads, ATL or BTL, it proves that the product is weak. Strong product does not need for all these advertisements. In the marketing world, out of 4Ps, the product is supreme. Focus on “Product”.Myth & Mistake-8: Marketing Gimmick-CAT/GMAT Toppers as TeachersThis is the most commonly used marketing tool, which has a flawed assumption. Now I am talking more of “Critical Reasoning” language. The flawed assumption is “All Toppers are good Teachers”. Teaching needs a very different skill set. The teaching is to impart knowledge; all toppers cannot be good teachers and all good teachers cannot be toppers.Myth & Mistake-9: Institutes offering Patented Techniques or “Tips & Tricks”All tests require “Hard Work”. If someone can patent “Hard-work”, then this “Gimmick” should be accepted. “Tips & Tricks” are developed with your hard-work. Shortcuts should be evolved and should never be learnt from someone else. Particularly for CAT/GMAT, which is more of an IQ test, “Techniques, Tips & Tricks” should be evolved.Myth & Mistake-10: CAT/GMAT will take me to HarvardThis point is more applicable to business schools taking GMAT as a screening tool.The student’s full profile will work. The CAT/GMAT is a one small part of the profile. Look at all business schools as a family, no family will allow you to be their part till the time they see their values or virtues in you. Every Business school has a distinct positioning and your profile should be positioned in the same way. Profile building is the main work and every person should concentrate on.Myth & Mistake-11: Adopting Toppers StrategiesHear everyone, but adopt none. Every person develops his own ways depending upon his Strengths & Weaknesses or as per his conditions. Good for someone may not be good for you. Hear everyone, but adopt only wisely.Myth & Mistake-12: Practice-More the merrierPractice Better, Not More. The practice should have a direction, running in circles will not help. Do Tests and review. Keep error Logs and keep on practicing. Practice wisely, so that every time you move, you should learn from your past mistakes. Do not overdo the tests.Myth & Mistake-13: Teachers will make me a TopperTeachers show us directions. Unless you practice the topics taught in the class, it will not work. I saw many students thinking that if they spend more time in classes, it will help.Myth & Mistake-14: All tests just needs lot of studying, no need to focus on healthHealthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. I see many students not focusing on their health during exams. Many of the studious people have unhealthy bodies. You need to balance life with at least 7-8 hours’ sleep.Myth & Mistake-15: I do not need any peer groupYou learn more from peers than the teachers. The most important factor will be jealousy. Competition in the group brings the best out of you. I was very fortunate that all others in my group were good. They have already scored more than 700 in prep tests. Every test was like a world war where every one of us wanted to beat everyone else in the group.Myth & Mistake-16: I will study and practice from lot of free materials on netBeware of free materials. There is no free lunch. Some free materials are good, but most of it is crap. The real test is different from the Free tests you see on the net. You will be caught off-guard if you are preparing from the net material.Myth & Mistake-17: Beware from 30-day toppers, 15-day toppersThis is the most common way of advertisement. Become a topper in 30 days or 15 days. It’s hilarious. This is a perfect example of fraud marketing. The CAT/GMAT is an IQ test. Only Asterix magic potion can do it and nothing else.Myth & Mistake-18: You can deceive GMAT Computer Adaptive AlgorithmPlease do not try. GMAC has evolved a test which cannot be deceived. Every question can carry you “Up” and throw you “Down”. Each question is important and has the same value as others do.One more myth is when a student believes that difficult questions carry more marks. And easy questions weightage is low. Do not read too much into any strategy. Work hard and it will show.One more mistake is trying to gauge your performance by counting correct questions out of total. This is the reason why the GMAC computer algorithm is difficult to copy.If you see easy questions, you are not doomed. It does not necessarily mean that your test is not going well.Myth & Mistake-19: Quantitative is important, Engineers have an advantageEngineers do not have any advantage in this test. Rather, they are at a disadvantage because their strength (Quant.) does not have substantial weightage. I have seen many students crossing 700 with 40 in quant and Q40 can be achieved by more than 80% of the test givers.Myth & Mistake-20: I am good in English, verbal will be kids playVerbal is not English, verbal is all about IQ. The only portion of the grammar it touches is SC. But the way CAT/GMAT tests your grammar is more based on IQ rather than grammar rules. SC is more about identifying the wrong choices rather than the correct one. It depends upon how easily you can see 2-3 splits and apply logic to find the correct answer.In CAT/GMAT, there is no perfect answer, you must mark the “Most” correct answer. There might not be any perfect answer in the five choices.Your choices should be based on your experience and how a help will help you cover your shortcomings. I found EduShastra customized approach much better than others. I also found their teachers dedicated to their students.","I'll tell you step by step how you should study to get 99.9 percentile in CAT,now you have around say 11 months to prepare. so CAT exam typically comprises of1.

CAT,Is cetking a good institute for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//Is-cetking-a-good-institute-for-CAT,"CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching",10,"I got AIR 1 in CMAT ( Score 350/400) and I have seen lot of bootlickers after that.What I am writing is on the basis of my own experience with two cheats from cetking — rav singh and ketan kg.CETKING is Full of cheats. I tell you my experience with them. I have never been student of that institute but they are so shameless that used my name to make others fool. They need only one thing — money by displaying fake result.Kindly read below how I exposed CETKING'S fraud.******** Exposed Cetking*******I could have opted to remain silent and it would have made me rich too, but my values don't allow me to do this.I want to bring out the truth in front of you so that you don’t waste your parent’s hard earned money and your precious time… and may be your entire life…I know the consequences too that might happen to me after I post this and you guys will be able to figure out who will be behind all this.What I am going to talk about, needs a lot of courage. This post will shock you, as it shocked me when I heard that Rav Singh CETKING is using my name to misguide students.I got AIR 1 in CMAT 2017 and was fortunate enough to get into JBIMS, Mumbai. Before joining this prestigious institute, I DIDN'T TAKE ANY COACHING to prepare for my mba entrance examinations. All I did was burning the mid night oil. Those sleepless nights and I believe that the god has been kind to me to get AIR 1 in my first attempt.After CMAT result I came to know Rav Singh.He invited me to his 1 day workshop in pune. I went there for a day. Just for a day.(And I HAD HAD NO HELP FROM THAT ONE DAY WORKSHOP) and Now Rav Singh says that he will get the affidavit from court and prove I am his student. what All I have to say is that if you go there for 1 day then another person uses your name to run his business not because of the reason he helped me but because of the reason he couldn't give that result what he supposed to give. What an achiever !!And it didn't happen for the first time. I have visited say no to cetking facebook page which says it has happened earlier as well.On the very first day I met RAV Singh, I told him that I was not “Saleable”. When I came to know that he had been misguiding students saying that I was his student, I thought to share this with all the aspirants.I took NO HELP FROM HIM IN ANY WAY TO PREPARE for CMAT, I haven't even heard about it before.It is just a beginning of story. When I retrospect I realize what all had happened behind me. He is using my photo and writing name as Suhas instead of Saras so that anyone could not claim it that Saras didn’t take coaching. Moreover we were in touch through whatsapp but he blocked me from his facebook group name – target jbims dream team, so that I couldn't come to know how was he using my name.Yesterday when I talked to him about all of it he told he had no idea that he used my name and it was a printing mistake. A big liar. I found it in one of his posters too where my name and photo was there… Wow! Great..Another person Ketan from cetking kept on texting me on whatsapp to share my scorecard so that he could make students fool that I was CETKING students.Folks, there is big game going on by cetking to trap you in. If you join them once they think you are under them.He has blocked me from everywhere after this post and a lot of manipulation will be made to prove they were right.They are many and I am alone. Why am I exposing him- I don't want any one to spoil his career in false hopes.I have all the screenshots which I would have posted but those coward people blocked me from everywherr.Cowards block people.When I exposed him on social media He also made a fake receipt on which my name is there to misguide you all again. The coaching which begs outsiders to use their name to ruin career of students, can not be the one to select.It is all upto you guys. All is in front of you and you are brave and wise enough to take the decision what to choose and what not. I wish you all the best for the upcoming exams you are going to take. May your result make your parents feel proud of you. Stay healthy, stay happy and most importantly be yourself.In my opinion IF YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF THE COACHING WHICH STANDS ON FAKE AND PURCHASED RESULT, you can join cetking. You are in a better position to see what happens to your career then.","No. They are much into NMAT rather than CAT. Also the real thing is they have a facebook group by Rav or Raghav guy who shares question in the facebook as per their window. In this way they create a good result for NMAT which is truly unethical. Neither NMAT cares for such activities. They even changed their testing company but still the practice remains the same. Unfortunately Narsee Monjee is yet again creating another scam which they did few years back. It's true they will again say they have no hand in this. Now imagine if a teacher gives impetus to such activity, how great he is into his teaching practices. I am just being truthful here. Regards,Online Preparation Platform","I had 2 classes, both from Mr.Ketan, the one and only. First class, he talked for some 10 minutes about himself, his attitude towards the approach to exam, how we should think like him etc. He went for a phone call after 10 minutes. And the moment he went out, i was like wtf? True, he was in IIM trinity, he got amazing marks in verbal. But he is no tutor. The best thing he taught us is to never sit in his class.Anyway, i decided i’ll give him a shot, go with the flow and see if i should withdraw or not. The guy keeps saying f*ck, shit like that always as if he is teaching in a low standard local college. Anyway, i bypassed that too. I went with it. But there is a limit. The guy keeps slobbering about how he is the best in teaching what he teaches blah blah blah. My patience was starting to run out. He never stopped his show off attitude like ever. I have never seen a stupider class before. I kept thinking about what to do after the class ends-which coaching institute should i shift to? til the class ended. Right after the class ended i asked 2 completely stranger class mates what they felt. They said they are going to apply to some other institution on the way. I also thought I would do the same. Then i thought-this was the first class,maybe he was trying to break the ice. I’ll give one more shot. I did and i regretted in the first 5 minutes of his class. His classes ruined our mood so bad most of us lost mood in the other classes. I withdrew that day itself and told the admission office that his classes suck. They didn’t even flinch. Like they are used to this.Anyway the last part is the refund. They made me call several people on their management to get it back. When i said the reason, they were like “its your problem you can’t follow his class, you shouldn’t blame him”. Fine, its my fault, just give my money back. One week passed, no response. I went there again, called the management in front of them, still no response. I gave the 2 people at admissions a fair warning that i would take this up a notch. They were like “yeah sure go for it”.They will drag you and make you kiss their boots to get your own money back. I’m not sure if this is for entire management, but i would suggest everyone to join CETking if you have too much money with you and you want some of it to go away for nothing.P.S- I used to watch the YouTube videos by Rav sir and i never had a bad opinion about it.","Absolutely not! In fact, if you are in middle of listing down your options to consider, erase them out completely.You’ll know why in reading the experience down below. Of course, this is my experience and I am providing my viewpoint on basis of their content, authenticity and my perspective as a student.My list of options to consider in Mumbai Suburbs was:TIME - but the reviews had gone terribly bad for them in terms of teaching and holding classes. Plus, there was no communication with the centre head in terms of explaining their process. Since their staff wasn’t interested I just could not see how well it would even be with them later.IMS - Well, their batch was full and no batch was to begin within next 1.5 months.CET King - I happen to see their advertisement and went in to inquire. I met with a centre co-ordinator who conveyed himself as an ex-student there. He painted this rosy picture and their sample lecture was just nice. I decided to take the admission and went ahead on the part. Communication with him until then was prompt, nice and elaborate on all the questions and his personal experience.But everything changed right after the admission. The classes did not start on the mentioned date and I was regularly following up on when they will. Along with that, the first lecture was suppose to be my Mr. Rao, who happens to be head of the institute, which never happened when the classes began a week later.That day, the lecture time being 7.30am, I could see no soul - either from CETKing staff or any other student. All calls to the area head were in vain so I decided to call the admin I was in communication with and as I was doing, he suggested I wait. As conclusion, I waited and later in time the classes were cancelled.This again happened during the next scheduled lecture, where the professor did show up, late in time but the keys to the classroom were locked up in office which the prof. had no access to.Again, when the first lecture did happen, way ahead in days, the verbal ability lecture was conducted by a professor newly instated by CETKing and whose efficiency weren’t very proficient in English language. He suggested us to use notes of IMS, since they were much better that this classes.It was their policy that students could withdraw within 3 attending 3 classes. But by the first class itself, I was terribly upset and decided to withdraw my admission.I still feel so angry while narrating what happen afters. CETKing officials had no idea about the refund process and decided to speak me into staying put with them. After a BIG and FIRM “NO” they put me in touch with this official from Thane branch and I mention her because she has given me a hardtime like no other.During my whole discussion of refund, there was no communication from their end, “let me keep calling and once in a while CETKing will grace me with an answer” was their response. I thought taking up the communication with Institute’s head would be more professional but rather he turned out to be spineless and without any answer.Moral of the whole 2 months of refund communication being that they deducted Rs. 10k on pretext of generating login for online course (which I never received until very late in the refund process, when I asked them to submit an email or a letterhead message stating that they have deducted the said amount for enrolling into online course they never gave me that. This only reaffirmed by doubt of them conning me. But, I was drained in efforts and had to focus back to preparing for CET and CAT if I had to stay on the course and could not pursue the lethargic process of Consumer Redressal.I share this with you as a lesson learnt out of this loss. I had a bad way out, I hope you don’t. This can be tragic to the focus on preparing for a challenging exam and thus, please make a wise decision before moving ahead.As a tip from this lesson,a. Hold on to the admission fee until the first class, atleast.b. Ask recently passed out students about their experiences with some classes in your area. This is the best review available.c. Ask questions to the officials at class and the teachers.And,All the best!"
CAT,How should I start my preparations for the CAT 2019 if I am weak in maths?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-start-my-preparations-for-the-CAT-2019-if-I-am-weak-in-maths,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",8,"As a rule, there is no distinction in the procedure and on the center territory between such competitors and others. There is a high number of such understudies each year who figure out how to split the CAT, notwithstanding not being from a designing/measurements/maths/scientific science foundation. In 2017, three non-building understudies got 100 percentile score in CAT. From here, it is very obvious that on the off chance that you plan hard, you additionally have a reasonable opportunity to get 99 or more percentile score in CAT.One should draw a limit among QA and maths. CAT requests just fundamental numerical aptitudes that we have learnt till class 10. CAT does not center around hypothetical thoughts but rather the use of essential ideas. This basically implies your insight into essential number-crunching and proportionality apparatuses, numbers, time speed remove, basic combinatorics, variable based math and geometry is all that could possibly be needed to enable you to split the test. The greater part of the issues present a dimension ground for everybody so there isn't a lot of leverage that engineers or other 'maths individuals' have. Most understudies escape and spotlight on 'exciting' ideas while dismissing more straightforward ones.Fundamental scientific expertise is only one component of the QA segment and alternate measurements are more vital. These are the capacity to perform in a weight circumstance, perception expertise, basic leadership, versatility/adaptability lastly a capacity to understand the inquiries.Tackling a CAT quant issue is a stepwise procedure and the fundamental calculation isStep-I: Comprehension of an inquiry,Step-II: Interpretation, that is, what is given and what is required et al.Step-III: Problem-unraveling (whenever required).Prior to moving to step-III, one ought to investigate every one of the conceivable outcomes of answer alternative disposal through different methodologies like perception or through discovering the scope of guesstimate esteems in the wake of dissecting the extraordinary cases. To teach the above arrangement of aptitudes, one needs to rehearse well. Time-bound practice will assist the understudies with understanding what ideas they require to return to. Set up a summary of equations subject insightful in a legitimate request. You have to likewise comprehend the confinements, conditions, under which these are substantial.","Hey Shubham Gupta !Thanks for A2A.CAT exam have not only maths (Quantitative Aptitude) but also have two more sections and we can divides this syllabus into 5 areas-Quantitative Aptitude (QA)Data Interpretation (DI)Logical Reasoning (LR)Reading Comprehension (RC)Verbal Ability (VA)Go through below given link where you will get topic wise syllabus of each area- CAT Syllabus 2018 - Complete Details of Topics required for CAT ExamIf we are talking about Quantitative Aptitude section, this section can be classified as follows-This section is widest area of CAT but You have studied all these topics of QA section in school time.

CAT demands only basic mathematical skills that we have learnt till class 10. CAT does not focus on theoretical ideas but the application of basic concepts.This essentially means that your knowledge of basic arithmetic and proportionality tools, numbers, time speed distance, elementary combinatorics, algebra and geometry is more than enough to help you crack the test.Most of the problems present a level ground for everyone so there isn’t much of an advantage that engineers or other ‘maths people’ have. Most students get carried away and focus on ‘glamorous’ concepts while neglecting simpler ones.Basic mathematical skill is just one dimension of the QA section and the other dimensions are more important. These are the ability to perform in a pressure situation, observation skill, decision making, adaptability/flexibility and finally an ability to comprehend the questions.Solving a CAT Quant problem is a step wise process and the basic algorithm isStep-I: Comprehension of a question,Step-II: Interpretation, that is, what is given and what is required.Step-III: Problem-solving (if required).Before moving to step-III, one should explore all the possibilities of answer option elimination through various approaches like observation or through finding out the range of guesstimate values after analyzing the extreme cases. To inculcate the above set of skills, one needs to practice well.Time-bound practice will help the students to understand what concepts they require to revisit. Prepare a compendium of formulas topic-wise in a logical order. You need to also understand the restrictions, conditions, under which these are valid.Preparation tips :1. Learn the theory from first principles :Make a conscious effort to learn theory from basic ideas. We have a tendency to 'jump' steps when we get familiar with a topic. Resist the temptation to use plug-and-play formulae and learn the theory with an open mind.2. Do 'the grind' :Do lots of practice. Intuition is important, but the ability to power through lots of questions is extremely vital. Major portions of the processes should be on 'autopilot'. Fatigue is an important factor in CAT and it is nearly impossible to be switched on for 140 minutes continuously. When confronted with a tricky question, if you pick the right approach after may be 60 seconds of thinking, the remaining 100 seconds of actually solving the question should be done in mechanical fashion; in a manner that does not take much out of you.More the processes on autopilot, the less tired you get, and therefore better the odds of 'cracking' the key idea behind the next question. To give a parallel, think about the time you tried to learn to drive a car (or ride a bike). In the first few instances, when the gear-clutch-brake mechanisms were still new, the experience would have been very tiring. Driving for even 30 minutes would have been exhausting. When the mind is processing that level of data, fatigue creeps in rapidly. But once you have done 200 kms on a vehicle, muscle-memory kicks in, the left hand and left leg move automatically, without having to be 'told'. Now, there is even bandwidth to speak on the phone while driving! Hands Free Please!3. Handle tougher questions by revisiting theory:Once you have learnt from first principles and done the grind, you would have learnt all standard templates. Now the knowledge base is set, it is time build the ability to 'discover' newer frameworks. Ask more fundamental questions and work with proofs and properties.","Hi Shubham GuptaYou have ample amount of time and hence my advise would be to start from the very basic level.Use R.S.Aggarwal books for learning basic formulas and solving easy aptitude questions. After finishing this book, refer “Handa Ka Funda” online course to smoothly sail through this CAT preparation journey. This course will help you rewind to any topic anytime which in turn will be a great boon for you to recollect any concept whenever needed. It also teaches each and every topic right from the primary level which is a great boon for beginners and non-math students.Focus on your English and fundamental aptitude skills. The following are the primary actions you will have to take and work on religiously:Polish primary Grammar rules (Refer “High School Grammar by Wren and Martin” for practice)The Articles – A, An, TheParts of SpeechSentence ConstructionModifiersSubject-Verb AgreementVerbs TensesMake reading newspaper and novels part of your daily routine.Spend 40 mins for reading articles and editorials from newspapers like ‘The Hindu’, Economic Times, Mint, etc.Read a novel for an hour, refer to -Recommended Books and Novels List that every MBA / CAT Aspirant Should Read. While reading, make notes of important/difficult words with its meaning, synonyms antonyms. This will further build vocabulary extensively useful in solving RCs.Use the books by Nishit Sinha and CL for practice.Spend 2 hours daily and by the end of June you should have completed the learning and practice part sincerely.Later start taking sectional mocks by TIME. Identify the weaker areas and practice rigorously. After you feel content, switch to taking full-length mocks. After taking a mock, scrutinize it carefully to find the reasons behind your mistakes. This method is largely useful in preparing yourself for the best.Tips:At the beginning of preparation, solve 2 RC passages every day without fail.After completing the whole syllabus of CAT start solving 5 DI questions and 3–4 RC passages every day. Keep taking sectional mocks daily until you attain the confidence with respect to each section.Spend at least 2 hours for preparation even if you are occupied for the day.Make notes along with practicing questions daily. Any sort of idea or new shortcut should be part of these notes.A quick revision in the early morning of the previous day preparation. This works wonders!Make use of each and every day with sincerity and devotion, success will be definitely yours.Hope this helps you. All the best!"
CAT,What is more important in the CAT mocks: percentile or actual score? What should be taken as a parameter for judging the performance?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-more-important-in-the-CAT-mocks-percentile-or-actual-score-What-should-be-taken-as-a-parameter-for-judging-the-performance,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",5,"It depends.Percentile and actual score both are important in case of CAT mocks.If number of mock takers are more and the difficulty level of mock is upto actual CAT paper than both percentile and actual score is important. If number of test takers are less than actual score is only important.A lots of mock test series available in market and all aspirants not enrolled with same test series so we can not give more importance to percentile. So finally i can say “Actual score is more important in CAT mocks”.Analysis yourself by mock test is the most important thing. You can identify your weak and strong area by these mocks. There are many Mock test series available now the days who give the complete analysis of your mock like weak area, strong area. Click on the give link- Mock Test Series for CAT, XAT, NMAT, SNAP, IBPS PO and SBI PO . This mock will provide a complete analysis after every mock.Analysis every mock on your side also and Keep following points in your mind during this-Focus on the number of errors made. Try to minimize errors, they don’t have more than 2 in QA section, not more than 2 in LRDI section, not more than 20% in VARC section. If you are doing more error than this number means you are also attempting those question also whom your are not 100% sure.Look beyond scores and percentiles. Score and percentile is just a number, they might make you feel good or bad but you have to look beyond this.Attempt the entire paper again. An average CAT aspirant attempts 50–60 question in mock mean they have miss out a large number of good questions. Re-attempt it again without time pressure.Analyze your question, set, passage selection. After re-attempt the mock evaluate yourself on those parameters- Did I attempt the correct questions in Quant?, Did I pick the right sets in LR/DI?, Did I pick the right passages in RC? etc in my first attempt.Identify the strategy that works best for you. Follow a strategy that will help you to solve more question. According to me attempt every section in two phases. In phase 1 attempt all easy question that you can solve easily in less time and mark those question that can be solved by you but they take more time. In phase 2 attempt all marked question. This strategy will sure you that you don’t leave any easy question.Figure out the number of mocks you need. Attempt at-least 10 mocks before CAT exam.Do not attempt section wise mock. Always attempt full length mocks. Because full length mocks will feel you actual exam not section wise mock.Identify your weak areas. After analysis 2–3 mocks, you will identify your weak areas and than work out on that before attempting next mock.Check if you are slipping in your strong areas. Some time this happen when you are over confident on your strong area and don’t give enough time to this. You can identify this during identify weak area. This should not be happen, if this is happen than work out on it also.Plan your next mock. After a mock analysis you can allot time for your weak area, other thing etc than schedule next mock.If you are looking Online Course for CAT preparation than go through this link- Online CAT Coaching Course for CAT 2018 Exam PreparationGood luck for your bright future.Jai Hind!","A2AStandalone, neither is of absolute importance in my opinion.As is the case with CAT, the mocks also tell you where you stand with regard to the test taking population. However, the sample set is so concentrated that it is impossible to draw valid conclusions from your mock percentiles alone. The number of serious takers forms a big percentage of the total number of people taking mocks (roughly 50% or even more if fewer people are taking a test). In case of the CAT however, there will be around 75–80 percent of the population that doesn’t prepare seriously in any capacity. So, while you might start from a 50 percentile level in your mock, you effectively start at a 75 percentile level at the CAT.With regard to absolute scores, it completely depends on the level of difficulty of each section and while most of the mocks tend to be close to the previous CAT, or slightly tougher, there would generally be a few mocks that try to sensitize you to uncommon scenarios (which, is of course a good practice because you never know what the CAT would look like that year). So, again we cannot really say that if you get X marks in a mock, it would translate into a Y at the CAT.The takeaway in my opinion is more of decision making than anything else. Throughout the mock taking phase, your focus should be on identifying easy and difficult questions as quickly as possible thereby optimizing the time you would have. The content part plays a support role in making sure that you solve the easy and moderate questions using the shortest possible method. The best candidates out there are the ones who can decide extremely quickly if a question deserves their attention or not (in fact that was exactly the theme of CAT 2018 in case you haven’t seen the analysis yet).So, to sum it up, try to build at least basic content before the mock season starts (you might want to attempt a handful of past CAT papers to understand what all topics are frequently tested) and test your decision making in the actual mocks. As you progress, you can improve your preparation from a section level (for example: VA/QA/LR is my strongest/weakest section) to a topic level (for example: PnC/Geometry/Numbers is my strongest/weakest topic) to a question level (for example: replacement in a mixtures question is something I am not comfortable with).Hope that helps.","Hi SamridhiI believe two things that matter the most in tracking one’s performance are:PercentileAccuracyScore can fluctuate based on the level of the paper but the percentile should remain consistently at the required mark as per your preparation and expectations or go higher as per plans. Similarly, number of attempts can go up or down depending on the level of the paper, but what matters most is your accuracy. Not saying these parameters are the only ones that matter: speed, selection, number of attempts etc. are also important; but my top two picks to monitor one’s performance are percentile and accuracy.Best wishesIf you want to attend a CAT 19–20 strategy meet in Delhi, you can join this event: Invitations, Free eCards and Party Planning Ideas from Evite","The score matters more than the percentile. The percentile is based on what others do. And, the students who take mocks of a certain institute can not accurately reflect the those who are going to take the actual CAT.And, when you look at the score , you realize that there is always a scope for improvement. It always keeps on your toes. It makes you strive harder and harder.So the score matters more…But ultimately the analysis of your performance matters more than the score. Knowing the mistakes that you have done in mocks will help you do better in the actual CAT."

We always joke that he will charm her away from me one day.Picture of Eden being a traitor mao with the BFONOn the contrary, she bit someone I knew, who turned out to be manipulative and controlling.Also, my mother recently threw a dinner party for her birthday, in which people were being noisy, rude, and disrespectful (refused to take off their shoes, even after I explained that we mop the floor regularly and that they could potentially really hurt my cat, who likes to sit behind people.) Ms. Eden sulked under the table for almost the entire duration the guests were at my house.Ms. Eden and her grumpy face.In essence, much like what other people have been saying- cats will like whomever they choose to like, and -at least for my cat- they often have good reasons for doing so.*A mao is a Chinese cat.","First of all you cannot “make” your cat do anything. Cats are cats and need to be respected as such.I recently wrote an article on training your cat to be a Therapy Cat and this goes in to great detail on how to “socialize” your cat as this is a skill required of all therapy cats.My cat and I are a registered therapy animal team. I would suggest you read this article and follow the guidelines to see IF your cat is willing to socialize with others. Notice I say “IF”.https://www.tailsofkalima.com/ca...If you follow the guidelines and your cat is not sociable with anyone but you then you will have to accept that. Each cat and their history is a unique being, must be respected as such. All animals deserve our love, kindness and patience.All the best to you and your kitty! Happy tails to you…. :)","Most cats like people, unless they were not handled by humans when they were kittens. Just tell your friends or guests not to interact with your cat, let your cat come to them and make sure to tell them to hold their hand out so your cat can sniff them, if they are receptive your cat will most likely rub their head against their hand, which is your cats way of saying it's all good.","I would suggest treats. Have your friend sit quietly on the floor & place the treat where your cat can find it. Might have to make it a special treat. It should now have your friend's scent on it. Then your friend can offer her hand to the cat. Not to touch the cat but to let it sniff her hand. A lot depends on chemistry and personality. My three legged rescue adores my son. When he's near her she rears up & offers her one front leg to him. As is she's saying to him, “Carry me. I just have three legs.” To other people she is aloof.

It is in mastering basics that the key to CAT prep lies.So, how to prepare?Before starting your preparation, go through the syllabus and exam pattern once. The syllabus is divided into three sections-Verbal Ability and reading comprehensionData Interpretation and Logical ReasoningQuantitative AbilityRevising your basics well is the most important part of your preparation. Only after you clear your concepts, you can do well in CAT. Complete the basics(chapter wise). Most CAT chapters are from your high school syllabus(class 8–9–10). Revise them all properly. Additionally, do lots of CAT relevant reading; daily newspaper(The Hindu, Economic Times, NYT etc.), magazines or any random articles on philosophy and psychology from wikipedia. You can also read non fiction novels and follow management blogs to nourish your reading habit. This will help you a lot in building higher speed and comprehension for CAT. You should also build good puzzle habits! Solve crossword and sudoku from a good English daily on a regular basis. This will sharpen your mind for CAT.Your motive should be to revise the concepts and to overcome the fear of certain topics if you had them during your school days. Some students never liked Geometry in school; some were never good in reading; some had issues with permutation combination - These issues need to be tackled first. Get over your fears in the first 4–5 months of your CAT 2019 preparation. This is the key to gaining confidence and also to perfect competition. A good CAT learning module with CAT experts can help here.Post covering your basics, your focus should shift on learning the best methods to solving CAT level questions. At my coaching (Bfactory), we focus on these major aspects:1. Value putting2. Option elimination3. Speed reading4.Structuring of information5.Shortcut methodsYou should try to think faster and sharper than before.6–7 months before CAT, start giving topic and sectional tests and solve advance level questions as many as you can. Be disciplined in your efforts and you will feel the change in your aptitude levels by this time!Give your last few months in giving full mocks and do complete analysis of your mocks. Analysis of mocks will help you point out your weaker sections and the areas where you do silly mistakes. Once you know your weak areas your task is to work upon them to convert them into your strong areas. Practice more questions until you excel in those topics. Testing makes perfect in a competition.CAT preparation is like a Marathon; start well and keep moving!

Then it's all about practice and practice.Also , cat is not about giving a fixed set of hours. It's about practicing something daily and consistently.What temperament should i have:You need to get passionate about quants, lrdi and english, so passionate that you see questions around you , from adding up your grocery bill to calculating the percentage of your attendance.Considering specific sections:English: Divided into two halves RC and VA and comprising of 34 questions (24 in RC and 10 in VA ). The RC questions have negative marking while the VA section is non negative.RC's are all about elimination. You eliminate the three choices and get the correct one. Make sure you practice variety of passages and at least 5 passages daily. VA Section , it is non-negative , but that's​the catch. People get lured by it and end up wasting a lot of time and energy.Advise: Do check what your accuracy is in VA section , if it is less than 50% , it is advisable not to spend much time in VA or attempt selective questions only .QA: Comprises of 34 questions ( Integer type as well non integer types ). Quants section is getting easier each year since CAT wants to reduce engineers ( quants has been the strength of engineers).For preparation, these are the topics : Percentage, Ratio and Proportion , TSD , Number system , Geometry , Algebra , P&C. Put extra effort on percentage and ratio and proportion because they form the backbone for quants as well as lrdi. Make sure you do all the questions with a timer.LRDI: Comprises of 32 questions divided into 8 sets of 4 questions each. Getting proficient in percentage and ratio and proportion does half the job.Out of the 8 sets , five sets are easy and your work is to find out those sets. Furthermore , you need to practice diverse sets and make sure you are accurate.Books for each section :Cat is not about going through lots of materials, it's more about practice.Either buy correspondence material from CL or Time ( Cl preferred because they have more precise and better explained material ). That costs around 6k. You can buy books by Arun Sharma , he has compiled for all three sections. That would cost you around 1500 bucks.Best test series :I feel Time’s test series are the best series . They bring in a lot of variety , as well as their solutions are very elaborate and comprehensive in nature.In addition, they give you all the stats including how many students gave the tests which no other coaching gives. Also, they have the advantage of large user base.What should be done now:Be calculative, calculate every second , like a baniya ( it's a caste ).Calculate manually on every occasion you have , whether adding up your grocery bills to calculation of taxes at hotel bills to random numbers addition. Make yourself extremely good with numbers.Try doing puzzle solving and develop reading as a hobby ( they will help you forever.)Cheers!!","CAT is not only about giving entrance exam, you need 2 years to prepare yourself for MBA.

The strength of the building depends on its foundation. Similarly, a candidate through with their basics would face less difficulty than the candidates who are not sure about basics of each section in CAT.MocksCandidates should give a mock or two to understand where they stand and what are their weak or strong areas in the CAT Exam.

Candidate should give major attention to this data. Since real CAT Papers are not present online candidates can download the CAT Past Papers that are similar to the CAT Previous year Papers. This will not only help because 20% paper is repeated but the candidate will get an idea of what will the rest 80% of the paper consist.Things that the candidate should avoid doing during their CAT Preparation.All kinds of Study Material-Refer to a particular study material. Candidates often buy all the study material available in the market which leads to panic and demotivates them to a great extent. So stick to one set of study material and complete it thoroughly then if needed shift to a different set of study materialOnly Collecting Information-Most of the candidates search on the net for various tips and strategies to Crack CAT. But piling up the information from various platforms and zero application would be of no use. Candidates can spend one particular day and search all the strategies and shortcuts on the internet but after that stop searching and start applying it in the mocks and understand whether they are helpful or not.Panic Mode-Don’t freak out and press the panic button just because the preparation days are getting lesser day by day. Every person is different and has different strength and weakness. The preparation level of every candidate is different so follow your own plan and stick to it.Influence and EnvironmentHowever simple or stupid this sounds a candidate’s surroundings, environment and their company play a major role in their level of preparation. Surround yourself with people who are willing to fight and have a positive attitude. This will boost your energy and motivational level which will also push the candidate to put their 110% in the CAT Preparation.Things that the Candidate should consider during their CAT Preparation-Analyse Mocks-Candidate should not give the mock test and analyze the mock on the same day. Take one full day to analyze the mock given and understand the weak and the strong areas.Strategies and ShortcutsCandidates should try different types of shortcuts and strategies in the practice mocks and decide one strategy to be used in the CAT Preparation. Trying out a new strategy on the day of the exam is a strict no the tried and tested strategy which is in favor of the candidate should be executed in the exam.Number of MocksThe number of mocks in total given by the student should be at least 40-50 Analysed Mocks. Initially, a candidate should start with giving one mock in a week and after a month when he/she is clear with their basics and know their level of preparation start off with giving 2-3 mocks in a week."
CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,"How ethical is it that CAT trainers appear for the CAT exam year after year and score exceptionally high? Don't they realize that to improve their vanity quotient, they're influencing the scores of thousands of aspirants negatively?",https://www.quora.com//How-ethical-is-it-that-CAT-trainers-appear-for-the-CAT-exam-year-after-year-and-score-exceptionally-high-Dont-they-realize-that-to-improve-their-vanity-quotient-theyre-influencing-the-scores-of-thousands-of-1,"CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching",9,"The answer to this is actually two folds. There are actually two types of test takers among the CAT gurus that I have seen.Faculties and Teachers : Basically the faculties of different institutes who teach Quants or DILR or English, generally mark the answers for their respective sections and in one or two sections they don't mark any answer, but rather try and memorise the type of questions. This ensures that they don't clear sectional cut-offs for IIM calls. So it is not much of a problem.CAT fanatics or Enthusiasts : These group of people tend to attend CAT every year and maximize their score untill they get a perfect score and so on. They definitely get multiple IIM calls, but that doesn't effect the regular Candidates because they don't go for any of the interviews and given that the B-Schools already call atleast 10 times the seats available, the other students who get a call don't generally have to compete with such people.Morever, CAT, once you get hang of it, is something that can go along with you a long time. It is a puzzle waiting to be cracked and each year many of the CAT Enthusiasts seat for it, just to see whether they have bettered themselves in any way.So personally I don't mind CAT Gurus taking the exam and it also pushes us to compete on a much higher level. :)","I have taken 5 of the last 7 CATs and I run an institute, so I finally have a question on Quora that I am particularly well-suited to answer. I do not apply to any of the colleges, so I can sleep easy. I dont think I affect the chances of someone getting a call. If IIMA has 198 general category seats and wants to call 598 people for interviews, they will still be able to call the top 598 based on their scoring mechanism. The presence of some scores that have not applied to IIMA should not matter to them.In fact, if IIMA notices that a bunch of people who scored 99.xx did not even bother applying to their college, it might knock them back and push them into working harder. This might do the rest of the applicants a lot of good. :-)","It's simple for me.I don't apply to any college. Don't tick college names in the CAT form. So, not hurting anyone's chance for a call.So when I am not in the race, the shortlisting doesn't get affected by me.Giving the exam helps me be upbeat with the pattern and help students better the next year. It is a duty for me.It's like being a football coach who is there with the team alongside the ground. The coach ain't there to hit a goal :-)","Straight line answer to your question : It’s completely ethical of CAT trainers to appear in CAT examination year after year, because then they are doing justice to themselves, their profession and their thousands of students. How ? By keeping themselves updated with the paper pattern (Paper pattern doesn’t mean marking scheme instead the topic wise weightage, difficulty level, etc.) Why do they need to do this? So that they can tweak their teaching style accordingly to squeeze out the best next year!Next point : Percentile score of these trainers doesn’t impact your chances at a B-school majorly (unless, if you are on the edge of clearing OA or sectional cutoff for a college. Yes, they might have impacted that cutoff) because they don’t apply for seats at these colleges.P.S. : I am one of the aspirants :)"

You have more than one year for CAT 2019. The speed can be built as you have ample of time. Believe in yourself and start preparing.You can join any online or classroom course for preparation. Both are equally good in terms of content. You can choose any mode of learning from these two depending upon some factors like distance of the coaching institute from your place, speed of internet etc. Following are the pros and cons of online and offline course:Online courses:Flexible.24*7 access to the courses.No travel involved.Teaches self discipline.Very helpful for working professionals and undergraduates preparing for CAT.Lack of interaction with fellows.Preparation interrupts in case of technical problems.Classroom course:Guidance and mentorship is not a problem as students meet their mentor regularly..Physical study material.More access to class activities.Can interact with fellows.Involves time of traveling.Expensive.Less flexibility in class scheduling.You have around 14 months which are more than enough to prepare for CAT exam. You can peacefully complete the syllabus, practice questions, write mocks and revise the concepts in these months even if study slowly. The best way to prepare for CAT is going by the plan of action or a strategy of preparation. Before starting the preparation, make a study plan and follow it religiously till the exam.It is required to study 300–500 hours to score a decent percentile. Set some targets like:Syllabus completion including practice by May 2019Revision - June 2019 to July 2019Test series - August 2019 to October 2019Keep November 2019 for 3–4 mock tests and complete revision. This revision should include your notes and the important questions from mocks.To make your preparation strategy, you can take help of toppers’ interviews or you can take my inputs:Understand the Syllabus and Exam pattern:The duration of CAT exam is 3 hours(180 minutes). Number of questions is 100 for 300 marks.There will be 34 questions from Quantitative Ability (QA), 34 from Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), and 32 from Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR).There will be both Multiple Choice Questions and Numerical Answer Type Questions in the exam.Learn the Basic concepts:Everyone asks us to focus on basics but there is one question which always strikes our mind - Why are basics so important?Now think about building a house. If we had all four walls already measured out and put them together against each other. We could make other people think that our house was secure. But once that first strong wind comes, suddenly the house is blown down and nothing is left.What do we do now? Obviously we will try to rebuild the house. But still the house is secure until the strong wind comes.This whole scenario is much like a CAT aspirant who ignores basics and thinks he/she knows it all. They stay with one topic for a while and then they move on to another topic without learning the basics of the last topics.So now the question arises that what was wrong with the house? We measured the walls properly and built the house in the correct ratio but what should we have done with our house to make it actually secure? First of all it is essential to lay the foundations. Then we build the walls, we add the roof, then we paint it, furnish it, make the outside look good and then live in it.In the same way your CAT preparation must begin with the basics.Practice, Practice and Practice:Our mind becomes good at the things if we do them repeatedly. Practice a set of question after learning its basics. It will give you a better understanding of the topic. With practice you will gain, accuracy, speed and confidence. Here is a list of recommended books: Recommended and Best Books for CAT Exam Preparation.Revise periodically:Human mind has a tendency to forget things in some time. But the good part is that it remembers the things if it sees / hears the things again and again. So to keep the things in mind that you have studied, revise them periodically. Make sure that you revise everything at least 3 times before appearing in the exam.Write mock tests:After completing around 75% syllabus, start attempting full length tests. After completing a test, analyse it carefully. You will know your weak areas by doing this. Now you have to work more on these areas. Note down your mistakes in a separate notebook so that you do not repeat them again.Read, read and read to improve your English part:Reading books / novels / magazines of your choice will help you in performing better in VARC section. Spare at least 1 hour in reading books. It will build a good vocabulary and enhance grammar skills which will also be helpful in Group Discussion and Personal Interview at the time of college conversion. If you are wondering which books to read, go here: Recommended Books and Novels List that every MBA / CAT Aspirant Should Read.Hope I helped you. All the best !!","You have more than a year time and utilising it religiously will surely help you to crack CAT. Depending solely on books and self-practice wont help you in a productive way, hence relying on an online course will be largely useful.A YEAR PLAN:Everyday Tasks:Spend 30 minutes reading editorials every day from newspapers like The Hindu, Economist, Mint, etc. This will help you in polishing your skills in VA & RC.Novels help you a lot in honing your verbal ability. Read a novel for an hour before the bedtime. Start with fiction novels of your own interest genre or else you can prefer authors like Khaled Hosseini, Sidney Sheldon, Jeffrey Archer, etc.Make notes of the new words’ meanings, synonyms, and antonyms as well as idioms as you read the editorials and newspapers. Use apps to make notes; this will be beneficial as it will always be with you anytime and anywhere for a revision or reference.Polish your basic English Grammar skills. Refer “High School English Grammar and Composition by Wren and Martin.”SEPTEMBER 2018 – JANUARY 2019:Start preparing for Quant, DI & LR. Learn basic concepts, and practice basic questions.I would suggest enrolling in “Handa Ka Funda” online course to ace in all the sections with ease. Refer to the video tutorials for learning the basic concepts as you start picking new topics. The structured method of the course will help you cover all the topics gradually as well as help you learn tips and tricks with respect to them.The following timetable will help you complete all the video tutorials of ‘Handa Ka Funda’ within 2–3 months.Along with the learning through the course spend another 1 hour for practicing questions from books of TMH/Pearson publications with respect to each section.On weekends spend as much as time you can for all the sections including VA & RC. Take RC tests for an hour on weekends.FEBRUARY 2019 – APRIL 2019:Start taking sectional mocksMAY 2019 - SEPTEMBER 2019:Take two mocks per week and analyse them to identify your strengths and weaknesses.Strive for the best.Thanks for A2A Md Wasif Alamgir. Hope I helped I you.Good Luck!","Hello studentWhat comes out from your question is the fact that you are not into the habit of reading. You need to build efficiency in reading and all three sections will appear better than before.Read these topics from wikipedia/google:PhilosophyPsychologyArtsScienceLiteratureSociologyCultureEconomicsFictionWhile reading, make sure you keep a track of “What” are you reading. This is called central idea based reading. Also note down contextual meaning of words which trap you. Guess the meaning as per context and then check the real meaning from the dictionary.You can also read some non-fiction and motivation/career oriented novels to begin with - foreign authors. Build volume of reading through novels. You can also refer to daily newspaper editorials for reading points mentioned above.Reading improves your interpretation abilities. This is the first step to structuring information. Then, the methods that you learn, section wise and topic wise come to your help in getting to the correct answer.Hope the idea is clear!

CAT,How can I prepare for the CAT 2019?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-prepare-for-the-CAT-2019,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",13,"Well, it is a very commonly asked question by most aspirants. Before answering this question I would like to applaud you. Since, you have planned to write CAT in 2019 and start thinking and making plans right from now to crack it. Though 7-8 is an ideal time to prepare for CAT. But you have about 28 months from now, you can do it very very efficiently. You can be at the par level of some of the best CAT trainers in India. Yes no mocking, seriously you can be at par!Considering the fact that IIM can’t change the sections at which they test the students, you have to prepare for four sections. Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation (DI), Logical Reasoning (LR), Quantitative Aptitude (QA).Since you have 28 months of time from now, you can explore and learn plenty of it. Starting from VARC section, start learning 4 words from today daily upto 25 months. Yes you don’t need to learn more than 4 words. They are enough for the day. So total words you can learn in 25 months period is 25*30*4=3000 words!!! Taking the assumption of 30 days a month. Phew!!! They are more than enough to decode the tough RC’s, whatever level of it could be. Do 1 reading (article or editorial from newspaper, I would suggest to read The Hindu) a day. You will complete about 750 readings and these will cover various topics like Philosophy, History, Finance, Politics, Psychology, Science and Technology, History, Current affairs, International News, etc. This will help you to understand the main idea of the passage and you will also learn about the various writing styles of authors. This will act as the main factor in decoding RC’s. Also, apart from readings solve 1 RC a day. And the rest remains Verbal Ability. Paragraph Jumbles, Summary of the passage, Critical Reasoning, Odd sentence out, Fill in the blanks, Last line of the paragraph, Facts Inference and Judgement, Paragraph Completion etc are some frequent topics that are tested in recent years. You can solve plenty of questions and will have enough grip on them. This is all about the VARC section.2) DI-LRNow coming to DI-LR part, which is the toughest section in the paper and the test takers give up while solving the sets. The best way is to crack this section is to start practicing solve from level 1 or even level 0 questions. Make up your speed and solve with 100% accuracy. Caution: Don’t look at the previous CAT question in the start of your preparation if you are not good at it initially. Seriously you lose hope and give up and keep this in mind that scoring 50% of marks in this section will surely fetch you 99+ percentile or even 99.5+ Because questions are lengthy and bit tough it it difficult for the students to solve the all the questions in the given time frame. That is the main reason why low scores will fetch you higher percentile.2a) DISo in Data Interpretation mainly question on Tables, Column Graphs, Pie Charts, Bar Graphs, Frequency Graph, Line Charts, Venn Diagrams, Caselets and various combinations of these are asked. This section is calculation intensive and you have to work on mental calculation to increase your speed to give an edge over others. Learn Vedic Maths, Approximation techniques, Percentage calculation, Certain common fractions, Squares and Cubes of numbers to make your calculation faster. If you are slow in calculation then you will take up huge time to come at the final answer. So start focusing on calculations right from now and you will see that your speed will increase drastically. But you must have patience to arrive at the results.2b) LRIn Logical Reasoning, questions from Linear arrangements, Circular Arrangements, Arrangements based on Rankings, Games and Tournaments, Venn Diagrams, Cubes and Cuboids, Network Diagrams, Quantitative Reasoning mainly are asked. Other topics like Syllogism, Blood Relations, Binary Logic, Logic Connectives , Clocks and Calenders, Number and Alphabetic Series are also asked in other MBA exams but they are usually not asked in CAT. Though you should have a fair ideas of these topics too. You can solve 1 DI and 1 LR set a day and at later stage you can solve 2 sets from each topic in a day as well. They will be enough for you to come across at different models of the question.3) QANow coming to the final section that is Quantitative Aptitude. If you will look at any book you will see that this section has a vast syllabus. But it is not true, This section test you in mathematical topics that you have studied in class 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th. No Calculus, 3D geometry, Conic sections, Trigonometry in it, which makes this section easier if you compare it with JEE levelTopics from which the questions asked are Number Systems, Progressions, Algebra, Percentages, Profit and Loss, Time and Work, Ratio Proportion and Variations, Time and Work, Races, Inequalities, Logarithms, Quadratic Equations, Boats and Streams, Speed Time Distance, Mixtures and Alligations, Simple Interest and Compound Interest, Functions, Geometry and Mensuration, Permutations and Combinations, Probability and Set Theory. These are approximately 20 topics and you can definitely give an average of one month to each. Solve 10–15 questions a day, means you will be solving about 400 questions in a particular topic. That is a huge number and one can stop you in doing that. You will be the master if you are solving 400 questions from a particular topic. Divide 10 days each in solving question of Level 1,2,3 difficulty.All the plans that I have discussed till now will not take more than 90 minutes a day (30 minutes for each section) and most importantly without the load of any time pressure beacause you have plenty of days from today. And 90 minutes a day to prepare for the national level exam like CAT is quite manageable and you can work out without finding any excuses. I am sure enough if you will work accordingly you will get 99.5+ percentile. No ifs and buts in it.Now the question arises from where to prepare from?I would suggest you to start doing preparation from you own side and skim through all topics. After a year you can join any coaching institute in India. Classroom Program will be the best. All coaching institutes are almostsame when it comes to study material, the only difference comes in the quality of trainers. If any coaching pays a high salary then you can assume that trainers will be well experienced. And fees of all coaching institutes is more or less the same. you will not find the difference of more than 5k.First of all, you purchase Arun Sharma Books. It will help you in building the base. I am mentioning the complete name of book and publication for your reference here.How to Prepare for Quantitative Aptitude for the CAT by Arun Sharma, 7th edition, Mc Graw Hill Publications.How to Prepare for Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension for CAT by Arun Sharma Meenakshi Upadhyay, 7th edition, Mc Graw Hill PublicationsHow to Prepare for Logical Reasoning for CAT by Arun Sharma, 4th edition, Mc Graw Hill PublicationsHow to Prepare for Data Interpretation for CAT by Arun Sharma, 4th edition, Mc Graw Hill Publications.I hope I have answered it clearly and all the best for your preparation!!Cheers!!","Thank you for asking.Answer might be bit long but it will be helpful for you. So use smartphone feature name scrolling and keep reading :pSo CAT 2019 is after 14 month and you still have enough amount of time to prepare for it.First CAT is divided into three parts namely Verbal ability, Logical reasoning and Quantitative aptitude.So lets talk about how to prepare for CAT 19 each section wise.*Verbal Ability*1.Start reading newspaper not only with the point of reading or increasing your verbal marks but also with the aim of increasing your General knowledge power and current affairs. By reading news paper you are doing those two things together. But reading newspaper wont be sufficient as it does not contain any questions and you might understand something but there are chance you might miss out something that author wants to tell shile reading article. So apart from this,i would suggest you to solve RC..Solve RC not from books but from Online platform,as most of the exams are Online exams and there is huge difference when you give same exam with pen paper rather Online. So practice from online material. For that i would suggest you to join iquanta facebook group CAT Preparation - iQuanta where you will find atleast 5–6 RC daily posted by other aspirants and try to solve them. Apart from this there are website like rcprep or you can find RC100 pdf online. Start solving rc from there. As out of 34 questions,24 questions are of RC and 2–3 are of para summary which is also somewhere small RC. so i would suggest you to focus on RC the most.If you are good with parajumbles then would suggest you to do it else just skip it like i always do.*DI*This one is one of the stressful section for students fron last couple of years. Not only because it is tough but it also checks how quick your senses are and how you are in selecting the sets.There will be couple of sets,which even they know that it is close to impossible for student to complete in the speed base exam like CAT and if you trap yourself in such sets,you might end up with disaster.So the best thing to score in LR-DI is to practice more questions on daily basis so you understand which sets you shoukd leave and before attempting the sets what are the things you should look for.Here i would suggest you to join iquanta facebook groupCAT Preparation - iQuanta where you will find one event dedicated to LR-DI, where daily 3–4 sets are being posted with its solution. Try it on daily basis without time limit at this point and you will be good to go.*Quant*This section is one of the most scoring section for student and you too should try to get maximum mark in this section.Try to clear you basics about each topic before attempting mocks or sectional. would recommend you to Join which is India's largest online prepartion group for CAT. CAT Preparation - iQuanta with more than 2.7 lakh people in it. You will find 400–500 doubts on daily basis posted by fellow aspirants and other aspirants are trying to solve it with different approaches and thats where the peer learning starts and which is very helpful.Stay in that group for couple of month and try to solve the questions and once they start their batch for CAT-19 student in January,you can join them too.Best thing about this group and there course is that they provide several shortcuts with method and in speed base exams,Short cuts are very handy.If you just want to see some of their short cuts you can visit (website link),you will find several quant short cuts in faculty gyan section,i was actually amazed by those shortcuts as those were never taught to us in any other classes and thats the reason iquanta is having maximum number of 99%ilers in CAT. You can check it from CAT Preparation online - IQuantaIn case of any doubt regarding iquanta course you can get in touch with them on i hope it is helpful for you and best of luck for your prepration :)","If you have decided upon preparing for CAT 2019, then the first and theforemost thing is to understand the dynamics of this exam. It is a 3 hourscomputer based exam which is going to test your aptitude and language skillsand eventually will decide your future as to which B school you will pursueyour MBA from. If you really aspire to go into an elite Business School, thenmake up your mind that you need to score a very good percentile which is not acakewalk. Slogging for hours will not do the job. There has to be meticulousplanning and optimization of resources. There are three sections in this exam-Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VaRC), Data Interpretation andLogical Reasoning (DILR) and Quantitative Aptitude (QA).All the threesections require a different skill set and their preparation requires a differentstrategy.VARC checks upon the language skills of the candidate. The different modulesin this section are grammar, reading comprehension, critical reasoning, parajumbles and para completion and odd one out. But, if one considers the mostscoring module, then reading comprehension holds the most prominent position.From the last few years there have been 24 questions (5 passages) out of 34questions coming from this module. The best thing about it is that you don’tneed to have any prior knowledge. Simply one needs to understand the passagesand solve the questions based upon your understanding of the passage. Forsome, reading comes naturally as they have been reading novels andnewspapers since their childhood. So, they won’t face major problems in thismodule. But there are many who may struggle with comprehensions as they arenot in the habit of reading. So, the first step is to start reading a lot onscreen.Read novels, e-books, newspapers, articles to develop the habit of reading.Make a habit of reading The Hindu daily especially the editorial section. Also,start practicing passages from GMAT club. It is an extensive store house ofgood passages. All the passages are time based here, so it will help you inimproving your speed as well. Pick up good novels and when I am saying goodit means novels of prominent authors where you can find enriched language. Itwill help you to improve your grammar, to understand the structure of passagesand more importantly will improve your stamina of reading.DILR- This is the most dreaded section of all the three. Every year the level ofdifficulty has been constantly increasing and it has become a nightmare formany. But this section requires a different strategy to ace. For LogicalReasoning, you need to solve puzzles. Make a habit of solving sudoku on adaily basis. Start solving two to three sets daily. Data Interpretation involvescalculations. So, squares of numbers, their cubes and conversion of percentagesinto their equivalent fractions must be on your finger- tips. Pick up resources topractice and start solving them. Start from the basics and once you have gainedsome confidence, then try to move to the difficult sets. Solve previous years’DILR sets. They are a brilliant resource to build your understanding and clarityof this section. Full length mock tests and the sectional tests will also give you aplethora of good quality sets.QA- This section is the most scoring of all the three and perhaps require most ofyour energies and time to ace it. It has a proper syllabus and you need topractice each and every chapter. The major modules are- Geometry, Arithmetic,Algebra, Number System and Modern Math. It is basically the math that youhave studied till tenth standard. But having said that, the questions are not reallyeasy. For example when you studied geometry in your school, most of us wouldmug up the theorems and their proofs. But here one needs to apply thesetheorems in solving a problem. So, getting an exposure to diverse models and ahell lot of practice will go a long way. Keep in mind that Arithmetic andAlgebra are the two most important modules. So, focus a lot on these twomodules. If mathematics scares you and your basics are shaky, then start withNCERT books to get a feel of the topics and gradually move to harderproblems.Now, there is one important aspect in the preparation. Whether to join aclassroom program or self-study will be enough. In my case I had joinedclassroom program by Kitabee Education Services. I personally feel thatcoaching helps you to trespass the restrictive boundaries set by our minds. Agood coaching guides you during the entire duration of your preparation,motivates you to perform to your optimum and more importantly helps u indesigning strategies other than the knowledge it imparts. It actually streamlinesyour preparation. But, simply a coaching cannot guarantee you results. Youhave to go the extra mile. You need to put in your best efforts to get the desiredpercentile. Also, join a good mock test series.I hope my answer helped u. All the best for your preparation.","CAT 2019 will most probably be conducted in the month of November 2019, so there is plenty of time for you to master the concepts included in CAT exam syllabus. Ideally, a year is more than enough to crack this national level admission test. If you’re really passionate about pursuing a career in the field of management then you must be familiar with the rising competition level of this exam. Therefore, you must prepare for the exam whole-heatedly to crack it so that you can get admission in top management colleges in the country.Performance in the exam is one of the main components for the selection of candidates in IIMs and other management institutes. IIMs also consider the academic performance and work experience of the candidates apart from the CAT score. Let’s go through the exam pattern of the CAT 2019 to get a brief insight into the structure of the whole exam-Exam mode: Online (computer based test)Duration: 3 hours (1 hour for each section)Total number of sections: There are a total of 3 sections in the CAT exam- Section-I: Verbal ability and reading comprehension, Section-II: Data interpretation and logical reasoning, Section-III: Quantitative ability.Type of Questions: Objective type (MCQ based)Marking Scheme: 1 mark will be awarded for right answerNegative Marking: 0.33 marks will be deducted for wrong answerThe registration process for CAT 2019 will begin tentatively from the 2nd week of August 2019. Students should finish 80% of the syllabus by that time. Now let’s figure out the key to score good marks in the exam. Here are some useful preparation tips for CAT 2019 that will certainly help you fetching good marks in the admission test-Don’t neglect your graduation: If you’re in the final year of your graduation, then the first thing you need to keep in mind is to focus on maintaining good academic performance. College students most of time ignore this fact and dedicate all their energy in preparing for CAT which affect their overall performance of the graduation. Now this doesn’t mean that you don’t have to prepare for the CAT, you can prepare for the common admission test provided that you maintain good academic record.Don’t only focus on IIMs: It is commonly perceived notion that getting a good percentile in CAT will get you admission in top IIMs in the country which is partially true. You need to look beyond the IIM as there are other good B-schools that offer the same quality of education that the IIMs offer. Candidates focus solely on IIM and when they don’t get the result they’ve expected they go into depression. Therefore, prepare for the exam with a positive attitude that you have to give your best no matter what the cutoff will be. You must however prepare as per the level of IIM then only you can be sure of your performance.CAT is not only about the scores: There is a misconception among the candidates that scoring good marks in the CAT exam will set their life for good. The fact is that CAT score is just one of the many parameters used by the B-Schools to shortlist the candidates for interview process. You must not think about the scores while preparing for the exam otherwise this will impact your performance. Simply put your best foot forward and jump straight to the topics giving no regards to the scores whatsoever.The key to success is practice: Practicing the mock test/test series on a regular basis is the only way to ensure success in the exam. A lot of students initially join a test series but as the time goes by they lose their study momentum and deviate from their schedule. This is the reason why some students clear the exam in their first attempt whereas some fail to clear even after giving multiple attempts.Current Affairs and joining the dots: To improve you English and reading comprehension, you must develop a habit of reading an English newspaper. Getting in touch with the current events affecting the world, business, and nation lets you form an opinion on the subject. This certainly helps you a lot in the interview. You should find the way to connect the dots leading to an event to get a clear picture. You may also watch English TV series/movies to improve your English Vocabulary.Use reliable books for CAT preparation: There are tons of CAT preparation books available in the market that can confuse the students. In such a case, students should only go for the books that give them the correct and reliable information. Here are some of the leading reference books which are famous among the aspirants for CAT preparation-Verbal ability and reading comprehension by Arun Sharma and Meenakshi UpadhayaWord power made easy by Norman LewisHigh school grammar by Wren and MartinData interpretation by Arun SharmaLogical reasoning and DI for CAT by Pearson publicationsQuantitative aptitude for CAT by Arun SharmaStudy materials by TIME, Career Launcher, and IMS.Shoot the depression: The preparation for CAT exam can be quite exhausting to some aspirants. But they don’t need to consider the exam as a situation of life and death. They should always bear in mind that it’s just another exam in life that you will take. The most important thing is that you learn from these experiences. So instead of losing hope you should stay positive and motivate yourself by reading the experiences of the previous year toppers who have faced the similar struggle when they were preparing for the CAT.Stay positive and never lose hope!All the Best!"

This is a walkthrough of my preparation/ how you can go about preparing for CAT and other entrance exams.CAT is considered to be one of the most difficult entrance exams in India, but it is isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most of the topics that are tested in CAT are High school level topics. The difficulty lies in the fear of the test. Most CAT aspirants resign to an assumption that they can’t score above a certain percentile without even knowing what the test is made off, half the game is lost at this point.I have been guilty of the same myself. Jan 2016, I remember looking at lists of MBA colleges and immediately rejecting the top 30 odd colleges for the fact that they all required you to score above 97 percentile or so to realistically make into those colleges. It was only when I talked to my father and he explained to me the negativity in my thinking, that I realised, I hadn’t even seen what CAT consisted of. I had no logic in leaving out the possibility of scoring an extremely high percentile.Another reason why I felt that I had to score an extremely high percentile were my 12th class marks. MBA colleges give weightage to academic profile. A self-analysis made me realise that having a low score in my 12th class (69%) was a huge handicap. If I had got a low percentile I would’ve found it extremely difficult to make into the colleges of the relevant level. I would’ve ended up in colleges ranked even lower. I had to score a 99+ percentile. BELIEVE you can Crack the CATHow to go about:I have divided the preparation for CAT into four parts:Pre-preparation, Preparation, Practice, Taking the CATPre-PreparationThere are a few things you’ll want to have in place before you start your preparation for CAT and other exams.Find three hours a day (not in bits and pieces here and there) three continuous hours to prepare. This can be extremely difficult if you are working/ attending college. This might help you to find a few extra hours a day.Get rid of any distractions that you believe affect your concentration or mental state in general. (social media is one of the biggest time-suck and tends to distract you even if you aren’t online)Get in touch with someone who has cracked the entrance exam or has some expertise in the same, you could approach a local coaching centre. (you may not enrol as a full-time student but you would want to be in touch with the faculty there by buying their material or tests etc.) This will be helpful in getting certain finner tips and in case you have difficulties.Get yourself a campaign manager. Cracking the CAT and getting an admission into an MBA college is a long drawn process. You are bound to lose interest or forget important things/ deadlines. Get someone who will keep track of the same. For me, it was my father who helped me keep track of my preparation and all the college applications. Make sure the person you chose exactly understands the process and understands what you want. They will make sure that you are still going even when the motivation starts to run out.Read a lot. This is extremely important when it comes to the verbal ability section of CAT. You will need a lot of broad-based readings and an ability to make sense of what you have read quickly. The passages for reading comprehension in CAT are sometimes extremely abstract and can be extremely difficult to make sense if you aren’t used to reading a lot. Places where you should want to read from: Medium, The guardian, Businessweek Bloomberg, Also read some classic novels that you can lay your hands on, the books talked about on crash course literature are a good place to start.PreparationCAT is divided into 3 sections verbal ability reading comprehension, logical reasoning data interpretation, and quantitative ability. Each of the sections requires equal effort and attention.Time for preparation: There are many people and sites who will tell you that you need 14 hours a day to prepare for CAT. Trust me that doesn’t work. You just need 3 to 4 hours a day consistently over a period of 3- 4 months to crack CAT. Anything more than 5 hours a day can and will burn you out.Source material for preparation: A common mistake that most aspirants will make is relying on just one book/ one source for preparation (particularly anyone who takes coaching). It is recommended that you have access to at least some material from different authors. This will provide you with multiple points of view for the same problems. (same goes for mock tests recommended that take at least 4 to 5 tests from A differen source).Verbal Ability & Reading ComprehensionThis is one of the most frustrating sections in CAT. The question often can seem to have multiple solutions and where options are provided all of them seem correct. Even if you are extremely good with English you can end up messing this section.The key to cracking this section (particularly Verbal ability part) is understanding that this section is more about logic than language. You have to understand the logic as to how the solutions are arrived at (jumbled para is the killer in this section).I initially worked this section by looking at the solutions, that way I was able to see what patterns to look out for and what logic to apply.Work on improving your ability to comprehend complex /long sentences, particularly from topics that you aren’t used to and having complex vocabulary.This section will take a lot of practice to master, more practice than the other two sections. This section has the highest returns for scores. If you get a slightly higher score in this section your percentile can increase drastically. (I scored a 99.98 percentile in this section).Even if you have a good command over the language DO NOT take this section lightly, I know of aspirants who have the CAT along with me having excellent command over the language yet messing up this section completely.Data interpretation and logical reasoningData interpretation is a practice intensive section. There is nothing new that you have to learn in this section. It is just the ability to carry out basic calculations using tools you already have (percentages, averages, summation, division). Practice these basic tools thoroughly so that you are extremely comfortable with them. Also get acquainted with all the various forms of data presentation, such as graphs, pie charts, tables, caselets etc.Logical reasoning is a section which you should and can make the most out of it. The questions are very often similar. While practising logical reasoning the things you would want to learn is gauging the difficulty of the question quickly. If a question is difficult, move on to the next one (time is important).You would want to practice visualising the problem (in mind / on paper ) in the simplest way possible. This will help you breakdown huge paragraphs full of seemingly meaningless words into sensible data.Learn to have an unbiased mind. One of the mistakes you can make in this section is assume somehting that isnt true. Learn to use all the information provided and only than make any conclusion.Read the data carefully a single word can change the whole situation. (for ex. XYZ is not wearing a black pant. can easily be mistaken for XYZ wearing a pant if you miss out on the not.)Quantitative abilityThis is one of the more easier sections to get by, You just have to understand the concepts behind all the topics involved. Again the topics in this section are high school level math. You can over prepare for this section and most aspirants do.There are certain topics in this section that you would want to be extremely thorough with since they appear most frequently (going by the trends of past so many years), such as time speed distance, time work, Geometry, Functions.You would want to also be thorough with averages alligations, percentages ratios since these topics are more helpful in DI section but very rarely make an appearance as stand-alone questions in QA section.Number systems personally I felt for me was an extremely overrated topic ( I spent way more time than required here)PracticeTaking mock tests, I feel mock tests will be the most important part of your preparation as they help you guage exactly where you stand. (another benefit is to know which colleges you should apply to).What is a good number of mock tests to take? There isn’t any concensus on this topic, there are CAT toppers who got by on hardly any mock tests, and than there are people like me who took close 40 mock tests.Personally mock tests where the biggest source of practice for me. I took mock tests from 3 different sources. ( I recommend atleast 2 different sources). Once you have taken a mock test it’s extremely important that you analyse them well, I spent about an hour and half after every mock test to analyse where I have gone wrong and what can be changed. Mock tests are also a good time to test out strategies in handling various sections. (I will try to come with a detailed post about analysing mock tests.)I will boast a little here, but thanks to the trends on my mock tests I was extremely confident of getting the percentile I got on CAT. ( I expected at least a 99.5 %le)I recommend practicing during the time slot you will actually be answering the CAT, I had to take the CAT on a sunday in the morning slot (9.30 to 12.30) at a centre 30 kms away from home. Considering the reporting time of an extra hour, I would have to technically leave my house at 7 in the morning on the day of the test. I usually get hungry within 2 and half hours of eating anything. So in the month before CAT I trained my body, by having breakfast at 6 in the morning and not having anything till 1pm. I also trained myself to sit at one place for 4 hours (830 to 1230). This may seem funny/ unnecessary but on the day of the test you dont want to have any other factors troubling you.Taking the CATTry to stop preparation for CAT at least 3 days before CAT (there are people who will disagree and reccommend you remain in the mood and keep preparing) anything you try to “prepare” during these last days often will be of very little help. Don’t wander away from the CAT mood though, read or at least make sure you are sitting 3 hours at a place for these last few days ( to stay in the CAT mood).Do not take a mock test in the few days before CAT, If you mess the mock it is likely that you will panic on the day of the CAT.Do not keep any expectations as to the number of questions you want to complete in each section.All the best for your preparation for CAT.P.S. CAT isn’t everything, CAT is hardly a learning experience, you won’t learn anything new as such (well other than how to prepare hard) it’s mostly about things you already know, taking the CAT can hence be a very frustrating experience. I recommend that you learn something else too on the side lines, get a hobby or hold a job (again debatable as to how much time you can find etc.) If you are taking drop read a lot, read all the books you can get your hands on. All in all try to do something else too that will help you grow.Belling the CAT and other entrance exams","This answer is fairly long, about 7000 words. So I have divided my answer into 9 parts wherein each part can be read independently. However reading the entire answer in one go will serve as RC practice, so that would be advisable.What I have mentioned below helped me in my journey from 66% -> 99.85% in CAT. I have tried my level best to be as detailed as possible. GK as a section is not there in CAT as of now but is very important in the other papers like XAT, IIFT, SNAP, etc. So, I have included that as well. I have also put in a little bit about how to attempt mocks and then analyse them to improve further. A little bit on GD-PI-WAT as well, so that this answer serves all your needs.I would like to point out that I have been an average student all my life and am a GEM (General Engineer Male), yes pun intended. My 10/12/B.Tech scores are 83/79/66. With that I made it to IIM Calcutta, so the first thing that you should now do is stop worrying about your previous grades. 99% of the people reading this will surely have better grades. So, if I can you obviously can get through and study at an IIM.My CAT 2015 score card:QA: 99.8%LRDI: 99.96%VA: 87.33%OA: 99.85%This answer is divided into the following parts:A.) How to start?B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityC.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningD.) VA -> Verbal AbilityE.) GK -> General KnowledgeF.) How to attempt mocks? (Non-CAT exams at the end)G.) How to analyse mocks?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?I.) GD-PI-WAT prepA.) How to start CAT prep?Register at any site which lets you attempt and review a mock for free. You could try hitbullseye. If you have already enrolled for a test series or for a classroom programme, then attempt one of their mocks. Many of you would be like bhai abhi toh padhai start bhi nahi ki, mock deke kya hoga aur upar se aadhe questions toh samajh bhi nahi aayenge aur maths ke formula bhi yaad nahi hain. Additionally while attempting the mock, there will be multiple instances when you will feel like getting up because you are not used to solving questions for 3 hours at a stretch. Your brain will also try to deceive you into grabbing your smart phone for checking Whatsapp. You will feel like drinking water, you will also be tempted to check FB. The point of this test is to make sure that all this doesn’t happen when you actually attempt CAT. Now you would be thinking what is the point in attempting a mock when I don’t know $hi+.Precisely my point! The main reason for this mock was to identify what you know, what you don’t, where you stand and how much hard work is required.Once you are done with the mock, check the solutions and find the topics which you already know, which you attempted correctly. Some problems would have been there which you would have been sure of but you got them wrong because you were out of touch and forgot the formula or recalled an incorrect formula. You probably forgot the plural of fish. Fish or fishes? Or does it depend on whether I am talking about a species of fish or multiple units of the same species? Then you will realise that a little brush up of a few topics (which you are out of touch with) will dramatically improve your score. Work on these topics first and then move on to topics which you have no clue about. This mock decides your future course of study.Now, on to the preparation phase.B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityStart off with this site. http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/Click on start and then check your score. You know where you stand. Keep practising a few times every day and your score will keep improving. If you can hit 50-55 consistently in the default 120 seconds, you will easily hit 99.5% in CAT in this section. If you are targeting 99.5+ then I would also like you to memorise the following:B1.) Reciprocals, Squares and Cubes up till 30. Pay attention here, some values will get repeated. As for 1/7. Remember that it is .142857. For other go up to 2-3 decimals,whatever you are comfortable with. I would prefer 3 decimals though.B2.) Power of 2 up till 12Power of 3 up till 8Power of 4 up till 6Power of 5-6 up till 5Power of 7-10 up till 4Power of 11-13 up till 3Again same as above. Some values will be the same. 4^6 has already been covered till 2^12 and so on. Don’t just mug up blindly, pay attention to the numbers.B3.) Square Root up till 10B4.) Factorial up till 10B1-B4: Now most of you would be like, dude they give an inbuilt calculator. But then other exams don’t have that calculator. Additionally who do you think will take lesser time in solving a question? A person who uses the calculator for finding 12^3 or someone who just knows it is 1728. Believe me when I say that this is very important for your LRDI section as well. This will decide whether you get stuck at 99.5% or go beyond that. This is the deciding factor. Please memorise these values.B5.) A few important numbers like 999=27*37, 1001=7*11*13, 21^3=9261.B6.) Some numbers have the property wherein the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the no itself. 1, 2, 145 and 40585. Please remember these.B7.) There are 15 primes till 50, 25 till 100, 46 till 200 and 168 till 1000.B8.) How to find the sum of the first n natural nos. Sum of squares of n natural nos. Sum of cubes, sum of 4th powers. Please remember the formulas. Specially the last one (fourth power), most people forget that.B9.) Scale is not allowed in any of the exams. What the CAT authorities mean is that the scale which we used back in school that is not allowed. They never said anything about using your hand as a scale. Check the length of your fingers. Also check the length of the 3 sub division on your fingers. Use your right or left hand, whatever suits you. Please make sure that you remember these values by heart. These values will help you solve 90% of the geometry questions. Also, buy a protractor and make sure you can make the angles 30, 45, 60, 90 properly. First with the protractor and then without it. Based on the question, make a rough figure. Then based on your lengths, find the answer and then scale up to the value given in the question. Geometry has a lot of formulas, memorize them or use this approach. Approximation ftw!B.10.) Unitary Method. Make sure you are good with this, half the QA syllabus can be solved using unitary method. Do you think whatever has been mentioned in B9 is basically Unitary Method at the end for getting the answer?Most of the students go for solving the maximum no of problems. Don’t do that. Focus on the basics, don't go for solving questions directly like most students. Most students don’t score 99+. You are different, work differently. This is how you should be doing it for any given chapter day wise. First day go after the formulas and try to understand why a certain formula is there. Make sure that you have memorised all the formulas for that chapter. If you were to set the paper, what could be a possible question? Read a formula, try to frame questions on that formula and then memorize the formula. Just memorizing all formulas in one go won't help, because you will probably forget. If you can do this, then you would have solved all the questions by the time you finish reading the theory.Example: Let's say you are studying Numbers. You see the formulas for HCF and LCM of 2 nos. Then you see the factors of a number. Now think of possible questions on this. Let's say 72.1.) How many odd factors are there?2.) How many even factors are there?3.) What is the sum of the odd factors?4.) What is the sum of the even factors?5.) What is the product of the odd factors?6.) What is the product of the even factors?7.) How many factors are squares of natural numbers?8.) How many factors are cubes of natural numbers?Good going, you just completed half the chapter! Similarly think of more questions that you can make. The exercise at the end is filled with such questions. It depends on your thinking. Focus on this. If basics are fine,questions won't be a problem.Would you memorize 456*876 and 235*9865 and things like that or learn how multiplication works?If you think that you lack imagination when it comes to maths and can’t do the above, then no problem. As mentioned above, by the end of the first day you would be done with memorising all the formulas. That’s it. Don’t solve anything. Just make sure all the formulas are deeply rooted in your brain and you can recall them anytime you want. Now take a break for a day. On the 3rd day, start solving problems. But remember that you are to solve by recalling the formula not by turning over the pages and looking at the formula. If you cannot recall, then please make sure you memorize the formulas again. Solve a few problems. Take a day’s break and continue solving on the 5th and similarly on the 7th day as well. This way apart from the formula getting imprinted in your brain multiple times, you will also understand which formulas are asked more often than others. Some chapters are connected to one another. Make groups of such chapters. If working on a group, try to complete all the topics in that group. For example:Ratio Proportion, Unitary Method, Percentage, Profit and Loss.Simple equations, Simultaneous equations, Inequalities, Time speed distance and work, Quadratic.Progression.Numbers, Bases, Miscellaneous equations.Surds and Indices, Logarithms.Mensuration.Geometry.Coordinate Geometry.Probability and PnC.Functions and Graphs.For people trying to clear the cut off in this section. The first 3 with mensuration and a bit of geometry/numbers will be enough.C.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningData Interpretation is speed and practise. The site mentioned in the Quant region and B1-B4 there would be of immense help. These will increase your speed. Generally each and every DI set has at least a problem on percentage or ratio.Today when you start, start off with the sole intention of solving all the questions of a given set. When you can do that on a daily basis. Move to 2 sets a day. When you can do that. Move to 3 sets daily and then to 4 sets. Keep solving as many questions as you can. Time taken per question will decrease with practise. A few months after you were born, you started to crawl, then you started walking and finally you started running. Same thing here. Don’t think about speed now. Speed comes gradually. Let nature take its course.Logical Reasoning, as the name suggests is based on how well you can interpret and analyse things. LR checks your thought process, it checks how you tackle problems. Get this book ""Puzzles"" by George J. Summers. When you watch a football match, why do you watch it? Probably because you want your team to win or you want to see a good contest and enjoy. Similarly, once you have bought this book, think about your objective. It’s not about getting the correct solution, it’s about improving your thought process. And additionally the puzzles in this book are tough. You could think of it as the daddy of Irodov. Engineers will get the joke! You won’t be able to solve most of the problems and frankly speaking I don’t expect you to. However, what I do expect from you is to read a question. Try to understand what has been given. Try to understand what is being asked. Think about it for say 10-15 minutes. Write down whatever approach you can think of. If you could not solve it, look at the hints and their solution scheme. Were you thinking in the right direction?Analyse the difference between the method given in the book and your method.Try to understand what you missed because of which you could not solve the puzzle. Try again for 30 minutes. If you can solve it, good enough, if not maybe try again. After a few more tries look at the solution. Remember you bought the book to improve your thought process, not to solve each question in the first attempt. Trying a puzzle for 5 minutes and then looking at the solution will take you nowhere. Solving again and again till the time you get the answer is what the book was bought for. To make sure that you can think and get the answer on your own. The answer at the end is just for verification. 1-2 puzzles a day. 3 at max, not more than that. You have to improve your thought process,not complete the book as fast as possible. Your scores in the LR section will improve in a month’s time and then it will stay at 99%.Another very important point would be to memorize the alphabet-number conversion table. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. You will come across questions on this in your mocks as well as in the exams.D.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI had 69 and 72 in English in 10 and 12 respectively. My verbal score in CAT went up from 43 -> 87%. Whatever I have written below is what I did to make sure that I cleared the verbal cut off comfortably. If you are looking at a 99+verbal score, then you would be better off by reading the other answers to this question for improving your verbal section. This part is not for you kindly move on to the LRDI section. If you however $uck at English just like me, then this just might help you in clearing the sectional cut off. I tried memorizing words from the GRE word list. My language skills were not good enough to use words like persiflage, perspicuous, ubiquitous, scintillating, etc. in sentences. So, I would keep memorizing and then keep forgetting these words. I had never read novels so I had never come across such words as well. So, I came to the conclusion that memorising words won’t help me. But, a decent vocabulary is needed for CAT. So, I bought this book “Word Power Made Easy” by Normal Lewis. Managed to complete the chapters in a few months. I didn’t do the word list at the end. I would request you to buy this book and complete the chapters.Another thing that seemed obvious to me was that whether you look at RCs or Para Jumbles or Para Completion or Para Summary. All these have basically been written by some person who had a very good command over the English language. So all these things should logically have a flow of thought with which the author would have written the entire thing. You just have to understand that flow. If you can understand an RC, then understanding a paragraph from that RC will obviously be very easy for you. Think about it, a PJ or a PC or a PS are basically paragraphs taken from an RC. You just have to understand the flow in which the entire thing was written by some person who had a decent understanding of the English language. But, then I again had a problem. The Verbal section in CAT was supposed to be of 1 hour and as soon as I would start reading an RC, 8-10 minutes down the line I would feel drowsy. I would start thinking about checking FB or Whatsapp or practically doing anything apart from reading that stupid RC. All those Speed reading techniques, skimming, reading the question first and all. None of that mattered. I understood what my problem was. COMPREHENSION and CONCENTRATION. By the time I was in the 2nd para I would have forgotten what was written in the 1st para. It’s called a READING COMPREHENSION for a reason. Never trade comprehension for speed.How to improve comprehension and concentration?Both will improve gradually with time. First step is to make sure that you don’t feel drowsy when reading for an hour. You will be required to do that in the exam. So you need to build your stamina to concentrate. Start off by reading 2-3k word long articles on News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian. Register on the website and you will get a mail every morning at 10am. Read all the articles from there. Make sure you read at a stretch for an hour. Read everything from Culture to Technology to Art to Literature. In the beginning you will feel sleepy within a few minutes of starting. Slowly you will gain rhythm. Within 15 days you will be able to read 1 hour at a stretch. In a month’s time you will start retaining information as well. Then focus on just 1 category every day. Like only Philosophy or only Art or only culture. With that your stamina and concentration will increase further and since you are reading about only 1 thing for 1 hour, your knowledge in that topic will also increase. This can be done at home, but preferably in office to better utilize your time. PJ PC PS are all extensions of an RC. All will seem easy once you are comfortable with RCs. Here News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian you will be reading 2000-3000 word long articles. Once you are used to this, 500-600 word passages in CAT and other exams will be a piece of cake for you!For verbal, always eliminate choices and then mark rather than directly trying to find the correct answer. This section is different from the other sections,so it has to be dealt in a different manner. Please eliminate choices and then answer. If in doubt, leave. As for the grammar section, I have no idea when to use have and when to use has. Same with is/are and things like that. Neither can I spot grammatical errors in sentences. So, I mostly leave such questions.But I always read them. You can always answer a few of them based on instinct. Some sitters are always there in every paper.E.) GK -> General KnowledgeAll the papers except CAT have this section. Some have a sectional cut off,some don’t. This section can be answered in about 5 minutes. It has the highest marks/min for any section. This section is the key to a high percentile. This section will give you the points for speaking in a GD and PI and also for writing in WAT. So, if you plan on getting through to a good B-School don’t ignore it. There would be 2 methods to prepare for this.E1.) Start reading any newspaper. Go through the headlines and all. Make sure you are updated with what is happening in the country. After a week or so, you will realise that it’s mostly the same thing that keeps getting repeated everyday in the paper. Think of it from the point of view of the exam. There will be MCQs. So they won’t ask for your opinion on Kejriwal vs Modi. Leave all the pages on politics. That’s sheer wastage of time. Don’t waste time on that stuff! Make sure you remember the schemes which Mr Modi keeps rolling out. At least remember the important ones. Did any big firm buy another one? Any Indian who won some award abroad. Who won which Grand Slam? Who won the Pulitzer Prize? Who won the Arjuna Khel Ratna Award? India is working on the Chabahar port with which country? Malcom Turnbull is from which country? I think you would have understood what is expected from you. MBA is about business. Focus on economic and business news more than others. Noble Prize in economics fort his year? How many Deputy Governors are there in the Reserve Bank? Make a doc file with these details. You file would look somewhat like this.https://docs.google.com/document...This is what I had made for this year, so no this won’t help you! You will have to make one with the current affairs of this year. Since you will be working the entire year making this, so by the time the exams are a week away, you will have such a file. You might however think that this is too much work. In that case I would suggest you try the second and relatively easier method compared to this.E2.) Whichever is the first exam for you which will have a GK section, keep 4 days before that exam for making this file and memorizing it. Gather all the monthly booklets which are given to Time students. Each book has about 100 questions. Memorize the ones you think are important. CL and Time both will also have a few sheets on GK, current affairs, etc. Get those as well. CL GK compendium. Hitbullseye gk pdfs are also there. You can get most of these online for free or search on Pagalguy, someone would have uploaded it there for sure. Whatever you think is important, please memorize that. 4 days is more than enough to complete all the material I have mentioned above. By going through the monthly magazines you will also be able to keep track of what is happening in India and also round the globe.The regular reading (The first method, reading daily) means that when the exam sare about to start, you would have completed most of the things. The last 4 days will serve as a revision for you. I did both the above things. So if you have time go for it. A close friend of mine, Prateek, he was preparing for UPSC. He was of immense help! Whenever I would meet him, we would talk about how things going on in our country. Served as revision for him and I would stay updated with facts. So, if you can find someone who is preparing for UPSC religiously,i t would be great. You will also have a contact who is an IAS officer. If you want to score even higher in GK get a small yearbook from some shop. Small ones general contain 100 odd pages, going through that will serve as revision as well.F.) How to attempt mocks (Non-CAT exams at the end)The first step here is to make sure that you can sit and concentrate properly for 3 hours at a stretch. FB, Whatsapp, drowsiness, drinking water or the sudden urge to go to the washroom during these 3 hours have to be removed.Kindly take care of such things which might disturb you, especially the last 2 and then start a mock. When you are attempting the mock, the only thing in your mind should be about maximising your score! Another point that you should keep in mind in that no one cares about what you know and what you don’t. The only thing that matters is your score. So please keep your ego aside when attempting the paper. Yeh question kaise nahi bana, kal hi toh banaya tha and then you spend the next 15 mins on it and still end up marking the wrong answer. Please don’t! You have a fight with your girlfriend and then you are like “I am not texting her first”. Yes I was talking about that very ego of yours, please get rid of it when you are attempting a mock. If you can’t solve a question then please move on to the next one. The examination hall is not the place to derive a formula and then solve the concerned problem. Anyways, I could go on but I think I have made my point.Remember that half the paper is very easy, mostly formula based. Your approach should be to attempt these questions first. Make sure that you have touched the 97-98% mark and then move on to the difficult questions for improving your score.F1.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityYou are not supposed to start from question no 1 and then continue till 34. Most of the times you will not even be able to look at some of the problems in the end. So we will follow a Round by round approach. About 50% of the problems are direct formula based. When you start this section (Round 1), keep the above point in mind. So, as soon as you look at a question. Can you solve it in a minute by using a formula? If the question with a formula was given to a 5th grader, would he be able to solve it. If yes, then solve this question. Use the values given in the question, get the answer and then move on to the next question. If you see a question and you are like, yaar yeh toh banaya hua hai, 2-3 min lagega, lamba question hai. Or if you are like sirf cases likhne hain, phir count kar lunga, phir answer. Such questions which you know you can solve but are not direct formula based, are to be left out now. These have to be attempted in the 2nd round. Getting my point? If formula based, then attempt else next. Within 30 minutes you should have attempted about 16-17 questions and you would have seen all the questions. That will get you at least 97-98% in this section.Now Round 2, there were a few questions which you had seen earlier and were pretty confident about. This is where your brain will help you. The human mind is so awesome that even though you just looked at it once but solved different questions and totally forgot about it, you brain was working on that question subconsciously without you having any idea about it. Now, when you read the question, you will take a lesser amount of time to solve it compared to what you would have taken had you solved it in the first round itself. You could go for Round 3 as well, your choice! But 2 rounds are needed. Please stop with a single round method which most of you are used to now.Why this approach?Many people are most often not able to see the entire paper,so they miss sitters. This round by round technique helps you go through the entire paper and thereby select the easiest ones which in turn maximises your score. You won’t get a prize if you solve a question that only 10 students out of 2 lac could solve. The marks per question is the same. Since you solve the easier problems first, the chances of your committing mistakes goes down considerably. A question which you have solved but incorrectly is not wasted time and only a -1 for your score. Instead of 3 you get a -1. So such a question effectively hits you with lost time and a -4. This method reduces the no of such questions. Hence, this approach.F2.) DILR -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningIf you have tried solving the book which I had mentioned above, you would by now have a fair idea about how to make a table for solving LR problems. 5 people, 5 countries, 5 cars, 5 pets. All of us have solved such puzzles,haven’t we? You would obviously have 4 columns but which would be the first and which would be the second, etc. That determines how fast you will be able to solve the set. Oh, you thought it didn’t make a difference? It does! Sometimes you are better off soling set theory problems by a table. This is where your practise and experience comes into play. Making the proper table means half the work is done then and there. You just have to put in the values and tick mark the correct answers now.Now about how to attempt. When you start the section, go through the 4 LR sets.1-2 sets will be very easy. Take a couple of minutes and try to identify the easier ones. Look at the questions. Do you see any question wherein it asks how many cases are possible or questions of that sort? Such sets are to be solved at the end. Look for sets wherein directly by looking at the questions, you know that there is one unique solution. Use the answer options to further reduce your time for soling that set. Now start with such sets. First advantage of this method will be that you will feel good, because you will be done with a couple of sets in 10-12 minutes. Additionally you will be in a flow and your chances of cracking a difficult set will go up. Now compare this to the case when you start the section, and think that looking at all the questions means losing a few minutes. I am James Bond, so I will start with the first set. 10 minutes later you haven’t completed a single question and now for the remaining 50 minutes you will keep thinking, yaar 10 min faaltu mein barbaad ho gaye. Good luck solving that section and the next with such a mind-set.Many a time it will happen that the set you picked up, is going nowhere and yet time is passing on. For such sets, wherein you have already spent 4-5 minutes but haven’t been able to mark even a single question. Please leave that set.You might be tempted to think sirf 2 min aur, aur phir 4 questions ban jayenge. Please don’t commit that mistake. 5 minutes is the threshold in which you should have been able to mark at least 2 questions. Worst case scenario 1. If you are at 0. Please move on. You are better off solving that set later on,preferably at home!Same with DI sets, go through the sets, select the easier ones, and complete them. You will be left off with 2 sets. Again with 2 options, it always easy to select the easier one. This way most of the times, you will end up solving the toughest set at the end or you will probably leave it. All questions have the same marks, so isn’t it better to solve easier ones? Additionally tougher problems will also take a toll on your brain, your effectiveness for the next section might go down. Do you want that to happen?Sometimes a set will be easy but a question in there will be extremely tough.Beware of such questions, these are put in place to derail your momentum. 5-7 minutes per set is what you should be looking at. Always look at the questions and attempt. You don’t have to attempt all questions from a set. Even 3 attempts for a set is fine. Again, you know the term that I am talking about!Keep that aside when attempting a mock.F3.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI get tired of reading and lose interest quickly. So RCs at the end seems a bad idea. So, I start off with RCs. Again as soon as you start this section. Glance through all the RCs in a minute and check if any of them is from a subject you like. Your reading speed and comprehension will be higher in this case. Again as mentioned above, just because you read an RC, doesn’t mean you have to attempt all the questions. Even 4 out of 6 questions from an RC is good enough. Just attempting for the sake of increasing attempts is sheer stupidity. Please don’t think ki aree yaar itne marks toh already aa hi rahe hain exam mein. Dusron ko thoda mauka de deta hun -2 leke. Please don’t do that. Eliminate options and then attempt. When in doubt leave. Move on to the single questions after the RCs.Note -> For non-CAT mocks which you attempt online.First and foremost thing is that apart from CAT, most are pen paper based, but at home you attempt online papers for these. Take a few print outs of the OMR sheet and check how many minutes you need for marking the answers. Keep a 5 min buffer for your safety. Let’s say we talk about IIFT. It’s a 2 hour paper in real. However I need 20 minutes just for marking the bubbles. So, there is absolutely no point in attempting the online paper at home for 2 hrs. Submit the test after 100 minutes. Don’t worry if people attempt for 2 hours and your rank is low. Your score in the main exam matters, not in this one. Similarly for SNAP and XAT as well. Form a basic strategy of how you would like to attempt the paper for the 100 minutes(whatever your time is after you have checked marking in the OMR sheet). Like for Snap, I had a strategy of 5-6 minutes for gk then 16-18 minutes for verbal, then 35-40 minutes for LR. Then maths and as soon as it would be 90 minutes after the start, I would mark all the answers. Then solve and again mark in the last 5 minutes. Similarly make your strategy for IIFT, SNAP, XAT, etc. and stick to it.G.) How to analyse mock?The instant you submit a mock, you will have a score in mind, itna toh banta hai. 1 sec later the page reloads and you see your score and you go, are yaar itne toh 2 section milake hi aa jane chahiye the. This is why analysing the mock is important. You knew a certain score was achievable but your score went down drastically because of silly mistakes. Analysing mocks will take care of such mistakes. Once the solutions and result for a mock are out. First of all check up all the problems which you couldn’t solve. That’s what you have to learn.Then look at the time taken by the topper in solving a question. Look at your time. Did you take 200 seconds whereas the topper took 30 seconds? That’s because there is a technique you don’t about. Learn that technique. Write it in your notebook where you write formulas. That was about identifying and learning things which the toppers know. You have to be one of them. Go through the mocks and find such methods. AdditionallyThen there will be a category of questions you were sure of but you somehow used your talent and got it wrong and after looking at the solution you are like aree yaar yeh koi kaise galat kar sakta hai. But as a matter of fact, you did! This will happen mostly in counting problems (Numbers). Even if you had 100 in English in 10 and 12 you will still come to know that you had been using some Grammar rule incorrectly or there is some exception you had no clue about. But, after a -4 you will remember them! You will sometimes come to know that a certain word which you have been using all your life can also be used in a totally different context. Thank You without an exclamation mark? Sarcasm! Oxymoron, alliteration, etc. Learn what these mean. Such mistakes will make sure you remember all these. Sometimes you will take the diameter as the radius and solve. Sometimes 2*3 will become 5 and sometimes 7*19 will become 114. Don’t rush through problems. The paper is set so as to give you enough time. Slow and steady wins the race.Then another section in the results shows the % of people who attempted a question and % of people who got it right. You are supposed to attempt the easy ones first, then the average difficulty questions. Finally attempt a few difficult ones or totally leave them out. Here you can check which questions you were supposed to attempt but didn’t. Also the questions which you were supposed to leave but being the Bond that you are, you nonetheless decided to attempt it thereby losing marks and giving others a chance to overtake you. If your family is worth billions of dollars, you could do that, but given that you are still reading this, I doubt it! So whenever you look at such questions, try to think about what was in your mind during the mock which made you do such a thing. Try not to commit the same mistake again.Yes, I agree all this will take more than 3 hours. Who told you getting into a good B-school was easy?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?The study material from the top 3 institutes namely Time, CL and IMS is mostly the same. I have seen and used it, so use whichever you want, it won’t make a big difference. A few new ones like Hitbullseye and test funda are also coming up. Haven’t used the material by these 2 so can’t comment. In terms of content the level of questions is higher in Time. I mean tougher questions here, so you are better prepared for CAT, but then you could also argue about why put in more effort than required. In CL, the theory and explanations for quant is way better that that in others. Theory for quant is literally non-existent in Time. IMS is good for verbal. As mentioned above, please use that book for LR and also that book for Verbal. I have not mentioned the names of the books, because if you scroll up and check you will then remember the name when you have to tell it to the shopkeeper! That LR book will help make a strong base for you and then completing the LR material from these institutes will give you practise and improve your skills further. For those who keep talking about Arun Sharma, please please please use proper material. Do you really think 1 book is good enough for your CAT preparation and others are stupid who go through all that? If you think you are smart enough and don’t need all that and 1 book is enough. Good Luck with CAT!Mocks basically tell you where you stand when compared to the toppers in the country. Time has the most no of people attempting its Aimcats. So having that is a must. Next in line, with the maximum no of people attempting the mocks would be CL. After that you have IMS, test funda and all. Aimcats are pretty tough when compared to actual CAT but are extremely important because it gives you a true picture of where you stand and how much more effort you need to put in. CL mocks are close to the CAT level especially in terms of quant. IMS mocks are close to CAT level in verbal. I would suggest Time + CL/IMS. You can however take all the 3 if you want. Or maybe some other institute’s mock series. It’s mostly about practise.The mock questions are mostly the same. It’s just the values that they keep changing every year. Same with the material. Whether you look at the material of this year or that of 5 years ago, you will realise that it’s mostly the same. So, you are better off buying old material from someone or from a secondhand book store. I have uploaded some mocks and some prep material. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...https://drive.google.com/open?id...I also found some useful material from total gadha. Here’s the link for thathttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...I.) GD-PI-WAT prepFrankly speaking, getting a score is easy. This is the tougher part. This requires more hard work because in here, you will be up against the best in the country. Most of the people attending the interviews will come prepared, so here your odds will be higher. So, please work hard for this. GDPI prep as such should be dealt with in a different question. So, won’t go into the details here, but just an over view of what is expected of you. If you had done the GK and current affairs part as mentioned above, you will be easily able to manage the WAT. You will also have ample of points for speaking in a GD. Similarly questions on current affairs in a PI will also be a piece of cake for you. What remains is the HR part. In here, you have to understand that you can guide the interview and you can force them to ask exactly what you have prepared. But that requires a little thinking. Tell me about yourself is a standard question which is used to initiate an interview. It is mostly followed by your strengths and weaknesses. The main thing here is that you have to try to make a story and link everything that you have done in your life till now with why you want to do an MBA. The interviewers are smart people, they have been doing this for years. They are extremely good at catching liars. So think this through well. This part of your prep needs your utmost dedication and hard work. Prepare your answers properly. It is really tough to explain how to prepare for GD-PI. You will be better off at some institute where someone can guide you individually. However, what I can still do is upload all the GDPI material that I have and share it with you. But do keep one thing in mind, this contains some files on the current affairs of 2015, so that will be of no use for you. The other stuff is pretty much relevant. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...I hope you convert your dream college. May the force be with you!","How ‘NOT’ To prepare for CAT/GMATOne of the most important strategy in CAT/GMAT is to find out the wrong choices to identify the right one. This post is dedicated to “Avoiding Mistakes” strategy.Myth & Mistake-1: Following the Herd. Choosing a help or any coaching because others are choosing itHumans belongs to Animal kingdom. If you have studied Biology, then this point will be easier to understand. In animal kingdom. Weak animals are always in herd but the strong one is solitary or always having small groups. Ever wondered Why??The answer lies in the mentality. A strong animal judges the situation and leads its life based on its experience but a weak animal actions are based upon others. If others are doing it, then it’s wise to do it. You can choose to be a Herd follower or to make your own paths.Never follow the group. A leader never follows. If you will move with a group, you will always be with them. If you will create your paths, then only you can beat others. Adding following lines from Robert Frost to add a dramatic touch:“Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”Myth & Mistake-2: Focusing on absolute number of Successful Candidates rather than Percentage.Most of the Institutes talks about the number of success stories but are silent on how many of their students were unsuccessful. Even their Advertisements talks about total number of students getting Interview call or final admits. But the real numbers are shocking, most of the Institutes have 2-3 % students getting expected result.But the magic is in numbers. Make people follow a Herd and even if 2-3% students are successful, the success numbers become substantial. The problem is that your chances of landing in the unsuccessful students group is 98%, but this data does not bother them because they know how to work upon the “Herd Mentality” of the population. Show them 2% success stories and make them follow a herd.Myth & Mistake-3: The Bigger the Better.I am referring to Class Strength. No teacher can teach a herd. If your batch size is more than 10-12 students, then you are not getting proper attention from a teacher. If the education company is claiming “Customized or Personalized” services, then the class size must be less than 10-12 students.Myth & Mistake-4: Going after a Brand or No.1 education companyAll Branded books are easily available in the market at very low-cost. A student joins any help or coaching to get a personalized teaching experience. A Teacher-Student relation is analogous to a Mother-Child relation. There is nothing called “No. 1 Mother”. Every mother is No. 1 for her Kids and the reason is her personalized attention.Rather than sitting in a large group with “No. 1”, you should aim for a personalized attention (We join any help for their teachers or their course offering).Myth & Mistake-5: Deciding after taking DemosAll Institutes stage their Demos. They are very carefully planned. The teacher is usually the teacher, who will not teach regularly. If anyone says “Book your demo” or guide you to a specific time, then it is staged. The best way is to ask them about their class timings and insist on sitting in the ongoing class. If you feel the focus is on you, then you are at the wrong place.Try to identify honest institutes. Honesty should be a very important deciding factor.Myth & Mistake-6: Choosing Institute which makes “Toppers” or just focuses on “Past Records”Never choose any institute if its marketing is focused on this fundamental. Keep your basics simple. Think what you want from it and focus on its delivery. You are there for education, not to hear its past stories.Institutes focus on this factor to take your attention away from their product. Your focus should only be on their product, their teachers, their teaching methodologies, their course structures, etc.Myth & Mistake-7: Jo Dikhta hai, Wo (Nahi) Bikta haiA good product needs no marketing. Weak products need marketing. Whenever you see lots of marketing effort, Google ads, ATL or BTL, it proves that the product is weak. Strong product does not need for all these advertisements. In the marketing world, out of 4Ps, the product is supreme. Focus on “Product”.Myth & Mistake-8: Marketing Gimmick-CAT/GMAT Toppers as TeachersThis is the most commonly used marketing tool, which has a flawed assumption. Now I am talking more of “Critical Reasoning” language. The flawed assumption is “All Toppers are good Teachers”. Teaching needs a very different skill set. The teaching is to impart knowledge; all toppers cannot be good teachers and all good teachers cannot be toppers.Myth & Mistake-9: Institutes offering Patented Techniques or “Tips & Tricks”All tests require “Hard Work”. If someone can patent “Hard-work”, then this “Gimmick” should be accepted. “Tips & Tricks” are developed with your hard-work. Shortcuts should be evolved and should never be learnt from someone else. Particularly for CAT/GMAT, which is more of an IQ test, “Techniques, Tips & Tricks” should be evolved.Myth & Mistake-10: CAT/GMAT will take me to HarvardThis point is more applicable to business schools taking GMAT as a screening tool.The student’s full profile will work. The CAT/GMAT is a one small part of the profile. Look at all business schools as a family, no family will allow you to be their part till the time they see their values or virtues in you. Every Business school has a distinct positioning and your profile should be positioned in the same way. Profile building is the main work and every person should concentrate on.Myth & Mistake-11: Adopting Toppers StrategiesHear everyone, but adopt none. Every person develops his own ways depending upon his Strengths & Weaknesses or as per his conditions. Good for someone may not be good for you. Hear everyone, but adopt only wisely.Myth & Mistake-12: Practice-More the merrierPractice Better, Not More. The practice should have a direction, running in circles will not help. Do Tests and review. Keep error Logs and keep on practicing. Practice wisely, so that every time you move, you should learn from your past mistakes. Do not overdo the tests.Myth & Mistake-13: Teachers will make me a TopperTeachers show us directions. Unless you practice the topics taught in the class, it will not work. I saw many students thinking that if they spend more time in classes, it will help.Myth & Mistake-14: All tests just needs lot of studying, no need to focus on healthHealthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. I see many students not focusing on their health during exams. Many of the studious people have unhealthy bodies. You need to balance life with at least 7-8 hours’ sleep.Myth & Mistake-15: I do not need any peer groupYou learn more from peers than the teachers. The most important factor will be jealousy. Competition in the group brings the best out of you. I was very fortunate that all others in my group were good. They have already scored more than 700 in prep tests. Every test was like a world war where every one of us wanted to beat everyone else in the group.Myth & Mistake-16: I will study and practice from lot of free materials on netBeware of free materials. There is no free lunch. Some free materials are good, but most of it is crap. The real test is different from the Free tests you see on the net. You will be caught off-guard if you are preparing from the net material.Myth & Mistake-17: Beware from 30-day toppers, 15-day toppersThis is the most common way of advertisement. Become a topper in 30 days or 15 days. It’s hilarious. This is a perfect example of fraud marketing. The CAT/GMAT is an IQ test. Only Asterix magic potion can do it and nothing else.Myth & Mistake-18: You can deceive GMAT Computer Adaptive AlgorithmPlease do not try. GMAC has evolved a test which cannot be deceived. Every question can carry you “Up” and throw you “Down”. Each question is important and has the same value as others do.One more myth is when a student believes that difficult questions carry more marks. And easy questions weightage is low. Do not read too much into any strategy. Work hard and it will show.One more mistake is trying to gauge your performance by counting correct questions out of total. This is the reason why the GMAC computer algorithm is difficult to copy.If you see easy questions, you are not doomed. It does not necessarily mean that your test is not going well.Myth & Mistake-19: Quantitative is important, Engineers have an advantageEngineers do not have any advantage in this test. Rather, they are at a disadvantage because their strength (Quant.) does not have substantial weightage. I have seen many students crossing 700 with 40 in quant and Q40 can be achieved by more than 80% of the test givers.Myth & Mistake-20: I am good in English, verbal will be kids playVerbal is not English, verbal is all about IQ. The only portion of the grammar it touches is SC. But the way CAT/GMAT tests your grammar is more based on IQ rather than grammar rules. SC is more about identifying the wrong choices rather than the correct one. It depends upon how easily you can see 2-3 splits and apply logic to find the correct answer.In CAT/GMAT, there is no perfect answer, you must mark the “Most” correct answer. There might not be any perfect answer in the five choices.Your choices should be based on your experience and how a help will help you cover your shortcomings. I found EduShastra customized approach much better than others. I also found their teachers dedicated to their students.","I'll tell you step by step how you should study to get 99.9 percentile in CAT,now you have around say 11 months to prepare. so CAT exam typically comprises of1.

CAT,Is the CAT a tough exam?,https://www.quora.com//Is-the-CAT-a-tough-exam,Common Admission Test (CAT),58,"Okay. I am going to post a different reply here. By ‘different’ I mean its not the usual success story that you commonly see from CAT toppers where they have cracked the exam within 2 attempts with just under 6 months of preparation.You have many websites for those success stories - GPkafunda.com, Careers 360 and MBA UNiverse. Websites like these post only the story of the toppers. You hardly get to hear the other side of the story if you follow only what they have to say. And why not?. If they start doing so, then their market would vanish overnight.I am going to follow the words of our late President APJ Abdul Kalam-“Dont read success stories, you get only the message. Read failure stories, you get ideas to success”and going to give a more realistic picture of this exam.As a person who has been bitten by this exam 4 times- I feel I have to give out my opinion when I saw this question come up in my feed.The straight answer to this question is- YES. CAT is tough. But the word ‘tough’ has got nothing to do with the content or the syllabus or the preparation.CAT- being a competitive exam, suffers from the same three shortcomings that almost all other competitive exams in India( like GATE, IBPS, IITJEE, AIEEE, UPSC) suffer from- competition, reservation and irrational admission criteria.Its important to know about these three things before you attempt this test.Heavy competition: About 2 lakh people on an average give CAT every year. And guess how many seats are there in all IIMs put together?. Just 4000. Is it not fair to say that the odds are always stacked up against you?. This is one factor which will always bring you down. You can think that you are well prepared. But there will be atleast 20 people who are probably more well prepared than you. This is not unique to CAT, but its unique to any government level entrance exam in India.Reservation: Now, dont get me wrong. I know its there because of social justice and all. And I am not asking anyone to cite reservation as an excuse in case you fail. But, even an SC student will find it difficult to an extent as the cut-off for the top IIMs would still be >90 percentile. You can check it here- http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/users....Admission criteria: A lot of B-schools look at your 10th , 12th scores as a pre-requisite. This is very unfair- IMO. Because you may not have performed well in your 10th Boards due to a variety of reasons. For example- my grand-dad died just 2 days before my 12th Board exams were to start. It was a painful experience for me as he was quite close. As a result- I could not concentrate much. Luckily I managed to score 93% overall aggregate. And my brother had developed a sudden viral fever during his 10th Boards. He could not concentrate for the first few days.Apart from these three factors, there is one which is unique to CAT- the normalization process. This used to be a big deal till CAT 2013. Since there are multiple slots, there is a possibility that one slot might have had a relatively easier question set compared to others. Thus the scores of the easier slots are normalized to a scaled standardized score out of 450 and then you are ranked based on that. And how this normalization is done- remains a million dollar question.And none of these factors are under your control. How is your 10th performance supposed to be a deciding factor in your selection?. Your social circumstances could have been different. Your level of schooling would have been different, your guidance and financial status would have been different. All these are NOT taken into account by the top IIMs.Point is- to eliminate the heavy competition, B- schools use these tricks as a means of filtering out students.Now coming to the much hyped ‘difficulty level’ of CAT. I think that this is probably where most success stories you hear from toppers are centered around. The actual syllabus is just elementary maths and English. And its not that difficult to solve these questions once you remove the three factors I mentioned above.I tried a simple experiment. I gave some 10 questions from one of the previous AIMCAT papers to the son of my next-door-neighbour, who is studying in Class 11. He solved all 10 of them correctly within 15 mins!!.And AIMCAT is regarded as one of the toughest CAT prep series conducted by TIME.Why was he able to solve when most of us cant?. Because he is in touch with the syllabus, when most of us are not. Thats the key ingredient you must know.There are three sections in CAT according to the latest 2015 pattern.SECTION- 1: VERBAL ABILITY and READING COMPREHENSIONThis contains a lot of commie level type of passages. The kind you commonly find in editorials of newspapers like the Economic Times, NYT and the Hindu. Most of them would be centered around some topics like - economics, art history, Greek literature, language and semantics, ancient civilizations etc… Atmost 70- 80% of the passages are from these areas. You can read newspapers editorials to get the hang of it. Or else you can try Arts & Letters Daily .SECTION- 2: LOGICAL REASONING and DATA INTERPRETATIONI just hate this section- to tell you the truth. I mean all these complex kinds of bar-graphs and pie-charts , the amount of mind-boggling data you have to process manually. I find this section the most irrelevant. In my experience of the real world- there are scientific calculators and any chart can be easily computed today using Microsoft Excel formulae. Thats how its being done in most organizations. I really feel that this section should be done away with- or atleast we can give a reduced weightage.But what I really like about this section is that its fun. Total fun when you remove the time constraint. And the next best thing is that you need not require any knowledge on complex formula- like you have to remember for Quant related topics. All you have to do is to understand the data given and correlate the various graphs. Most of the questions in this section could be solved when you tabulate all the data in a single table or a single graph.SECTION-3: QUANTITATIVE ABILITY:Probably the most easiest of all. Some may be surprised at this, because they are most likely to have forgotten what they have learnt in their 10th and 12th Maths. But the NCERT books can really be a good foundation with which you can attempt this section. Questions asked are from the following areas.Geometry and Mensuration- Questions on circles, triangles, polygons and properties.Permutation and Probability- Selection, arrangements.Number Theory- Remainder Theorem, Factor theorem.Progressions- AP, GP, HP, Number series.Algebra- equations, functions and graphs.Business Maths- Profit and Loss, SI& CI, RPVs etc…Most of these topics can be found in NCERT text books or you can even refer your old Maths book- if you still have it. Once you have written all the basic formula in a paper, you can easily tabulate them accordingly as to when you should apply which formula.Once this is done- you can solve a lot of sectional tests Probably the most important step. Most are available for free- if you are going with self-study.Or you can enroll in one the coaching centers and take them too- this is the best course for first-timers.But even after doing all this- you have to be prepared for the worst. Like I said before- if you think you are prepared, there are atleast 20 more people who are more well-prepared than you.The difference between the absolute raw scores( not scaled scores) of a 90 percentiler and a 100 percentiler might not be much( most probably a difference of 50–70 marks, going by what I used to analyze with my mock scores). And percentile ranking is flawed to an extent. Its a ranking system - just a relative score and not an absolute way to judge your talent.In summary: Yes, CAT is tough and unique- in its own respect. It has got its own share of flaws too. Its foolish to compare it with JEE/GATE and say that its easier. Its like comparing apples with oranges.","CAT isn’t difficult at all . It is an exam which tests your coolness and decision making power. CAT is all about choosing the right question and leaving a question if it takes much time of yours(Only by constant practice,u can increase the speed and choose the right question).And you should also understand that the colleges doesn’t consider your score and they consider your percentile only. The main reason for failure in cat is the “aspirants ego”(Don’t mistake me guys).Because we test takers, when we did not get the solution for an easy question, we get tensed and try to solve that question, which may eat up our valuable minutes.Strategy to be followed acc. to my point of view:If u r strong in basics then ok; else clear your basics of q,v,r in a month or two(one month is actually enough).Then start solving aimcat test series(Note: Need not solve all qns in ur course books; start aimcat asap)Understand the concepts from course books and then start solving the aimcat series from January itself(THIS IS IMPORTANT: pls pls start aimcat from jan itself; even if u dint complete ur course books).And don’t ever skip any aimcat. Taking aimcat is important but the more imp. thing is reviewing your aimcat papers thoroughly before giving your next aimcat .Reviewing is not all about understanding the “no idea” qns alone. It’s about finding the shortcuts for each qns and sticking to the fastest way of solving the qns. And it’s also important to read the newspapers daily in order to improve ur vocabulary, reading speed(words per min needs to be increased drastically).It helps a lot in GD too.","No.Cracking CAT is not tough. CAT is an aptitude test. You need to be in high spirits built with good practice. That is the key.Lots of people take the CAT prep too hard on themselves, this ain’t fair. Reason: CAT is an aptitude exam, you can do awesome on your day! It is not a syllabus coverage based exam. It is about solving the questions you know well -an exam of calm mind - selection of easy to moderate questions and solving them!But, the other side is also not cool - you should not just do nothing or do bits and pieces.What I advice my students is to practice hard till a month before CAT and then relax a month before CAT - only do basic revision and give a few mocks. Keep your calm in the final month. Aptitude, once built, stays for long. So practice and then relax and enter CAT.Load nahi lene ka guys!Best wishesRahul SirFollow my CAT prep group on: CAT Prep with IIM A alumni","Is CAT exam really tough? It just might be and at the same time, it might not be. How? Simple, not all humans are same and not everyone have same logical and metal aptitude. Not everyone is preparing the same way you are, Not everyone have been disciplined enough to prepare, Not everyone have their basics clear or have a good vocabulary skills.It is up to you to decide where to land and where do you want to see yourself. Lets take a quick peek at what CAT is,Quant 1.Basic Quant: 12 to 14 questions, This section accounts for Maths that we learn in our 6–9th grades. These contain basic topics like percentages Profit/Loss and what not. Now it depends for person to person on how much time allocation needs to be. Books like Rd Sharma are enough for this section.2.Data Interpretation: 15 to 17 questions, This section is all about reading charts and graphs and analysing the data given , and hence it does not require much practisce until you are like a year to give your exam3.Data Sufficiency : 2 to 3 questions4.Geometry and Algebra : 17 to 18 questions: This is a slightly more tougher topic and you will need some certain professional help in order to master this part of the paper. I would highly recommend you buy correspondence packs of institutions like TIME etc.Verbal 1.Reading Comprehensions: 15 to 17 questions: To improve this part one must read read an dread. There is no shortcut to master RC’s. It is preferable that you read 500–600 passages as part of the preparation as that is the idle size of an RC expected in the paper itself. As you will read for days you will notice that your reading time per passage is decreasing and you will slowly learn the way of speed reading.2. Logical Reasoning: 15 to 17 Questions: These questions are very basic conceptual based algorithms which you have already prbably done in many Olympiads and stuff, no extra practice must go into it if you have a high aptitude.3. Paragraph Completion/Sentence Rearrangement/ Sentence elimination: 3 questions: This involves deep knowledge of grammar and hence I would recommend you to go through the book called Wren and Martin. Grammar will take time to improve and dont stop your practice once you think that you are thorough enough instead keep practicing this till the last day.4.Text Completion/Word Usage:3 questions: For this high vocab skill set is required and I would recommend you to use Word Power Made easy by Norman Lewis, which has application and roots of many words which will not only help you in your CAT but also in GRE GMAT and what not. An app called VoLT (Vocabulary Learning Technique) is also there which is really helpful as it has pictorial representation of words and really large word list for that matter . Do check it out I found it very helpful.Follow the lead given up here and you be just fine, again all I can comment upon is based on what an average person and candidate would prepare for. Maybe you have a very good base of Maths have been speaking English for the most part of your life, then its a complete different scenario.So keep calm and prepare, No need to be scared. Trust on yourself that YES, you have prepared the best way possible and you will be just fine."
CAT,What is a very rare motivational story that you know that I don't?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-a-very-rare-motivational-story-that-you-know-that-I-dont,"Motivational Stories, Common Admission Test (CAT)",23,"Well, there are millions of motivational stories in the world. Many out there on the internet, but a person can only come across so many in a lifetime.My personal favorite is of two people, Elon Musk and Alan Turing. I’d like to tell the former. For Alan Turing, you can watch the movie “The Imitation Game”, or maybe i’ll come back to this question someday and write the bits of his life not widely known.What would you do if you are in your early 30s and have over $150 million in your bank account? I don’t know about you, but i’d probably buy an island, couple of big mansions, never work again, might do some investments but probably spend the rest of my life resting and travelling.Elon was different. For him, money was nothing more than a source of creating a better future for humanity. We all know what SpaceX has achieved but not a lot of people know why it was started in the first place.Elon was always fascinated by the space exploration and the idea of making life multi planetary. Back in 2002, after the paypal was sold to ebay for $1.5 billion, Elon being the biggest share holder, ended up with $165 million in addition to $22 million from his first venture, Zip2 . He went to the website of NASA, looking for future plans that NASA has for Mars. Turns out there were none.He thought there isn’t enough will left in people for space exploration anymore. He decided to do something to get people excited about the space, which might even result in increase in NASA budget. So, he decided to send a greenhouse to Mars, hydrate it upon landing. So, it would be like “this is the farthest life has ever traveled.” He thought it would get people excited for space again. He didn’t have his own rockets at that time, so he had no choice but to buy them. American rockets were too expensive to afford, so he went to Russia three times to buy Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). He even closed a deal of three rockets for $10 million each.Later, he realized, it’s not that there isn’t enough will, the reason we stopped was because it was too expensive to go to space. And the only way to solve this issue is by starting his own space company. He knew the odds of success of SpaceX was less than 10% cause going to orbit is a tricky thing and hence not many countries are capable of sending people or satellite to orbit. He only had enough money to create and launch three rockets. And guess what, SpaceX had three failures in a row. It was 2008, tesla, SpaceX and Solar City, all three companies of Elon was at the edge of failure. It was the year of financial crisis, it was impossible to find investor, especially for a company that had 3 rocket failures in a row. Tesla was also trying to raise the financing round but it fell apart cause people didn’t have money.Elon only had two choices, either to invest whatever he has left into SpaceX and Tesla and save them for a little bit or let them die. He poured all of his money into them. If there was another rocket failure, the SpaceX would’ve died. As for Tesla, they closed the financing deal with Daimler on last hour of last day possible (Eve of 25th December, 2008). Tesla would’ve gone bankrupt a couple days later if it weren’t for that deal.It’s not his companies that excites me, it’s his determination, his will to improve. No one thought that resusability of rockets is even feasible. But while others were busy giving reasons why it can’t be done, Elon was busy finding ways of how possibly it can be done. That’s what i find inspiring about him. We find excuses, while he finds ways. He works over 80 hours a week. Being CEO of two big companies is not easy. Any day he could wake up and decide “i don’t want to deal with this stress. I will hire a CEO to run this for me.” He doesn’t have to work 80 hours but he does. At SpaceX and Tesla, he doesn’t even have his own office. He has a cubicle, just like others. There are million more things about his life that i could list, but it’s already too long for an answer. Here are links to two interviews of him that you should definitely watch. If his life doesn’t inspire you, i don’t know what will.","This is a Real Story: Facebook3 year ago, Zuckerberg got disappointed at the current justice system. so he decided to do something to change it for the better, his research lead him to the San Quentin program, This program aimed at educating prisoners so they have shot at a better life when they get out.Zuckerberg did not waste a moment to become a part of it so, he supported and funded that program. He even visited the San Quentin prison to see the differences it hade made.To his surprise, It was success with many of the prisoners and one of them named “Aly Tamboura” stood out from the rest. He was sentenced 14 years in prison and he thought that all hope was lost for future but feeling of Motivation arose in him when Mark Zuckerberg came on a tour of the prison.Zukerberg personally met and told Tamboura how impressed he was by his efforts.and even encouraged him to apply at facebook. that feeling of approval from Zuckerberg stayed with him long after.He worked day and night to learn how to code and become as good at it, as possibly could.When aly got released, he got a job at Facebook. he even met Mark after joining the facebook.To Tamboura’s shock, Mark remembered him and congratulated him on making it this far.Today, Tamboura is Manager of Technology for Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.“Second chances are given to prove that we could be better even after we fall.”Everyone deserves a second chance to Clean Up their Mistakes.","“I made up my mind as a young guy, I want to become world class at something. I just had to find out what that something is going to be”. Well, when Christopher Paul Gardner found out that “something”, he went on to become a millionaire and the CEO of his own stockbrokerage firm, Gardner Rich and Co. from nearly nothing.Although not rare, Gardner’s motivational story has touched the life of millions and inspired so many young professionals and entrepreneurs.The person who cut grass, rubbed floors, cleaned trash, did roofing and painted walls strived to earn a repute and become a successful trader in the Wall Street.Gardner had also promised to himself that he would never let his child go through that same pain and suffering that he endured when he was a fatherless child. Gardner had a troubled childhood where he and his mother alongwith his sisters were physically abused by his stepfather. The wounds inflicted by those abuse and domestic violence stayed with Gardner forever. But he became a successful and caring parent by keeping the promise of loving and nurturing his child even during his bad days.Speaking of his bad days, Chris Gardner was homeless for a year. To make matter worse, his son Chris Jr. was left with him by his estranged wife who had some months back moved to some other US city with their child because she was unhappy with Gardner’s unemployment (“Unemployment brings trouble in married life”)Gardner left his job as a medical equipment salesman to get into a full time training program at E.F Hutton. But Gardner was running on bad luck those days, as the hiring manager, who had promised a seat to him, was just fired a week before from the firm. This practically rendered Gardner jobless!It was during this time, Gardner took to cutting grass, moping floors or painting walls to earn a livelihood and support his family that was falling apart. For every dollar he earned, he had to make a wise decision to spend that dollar. From running daily errands to keep food on the table, to paying house rent and buy this and that, he did all that he could to keep his family bonded with the meagre income he made.Gardner had met a man on a red ferrari someday while he was still working as a medical equipment salesman. This man confided him that he was a stockbroker and roughly earned $80,000 a month. It was from here Gardner’s thirst for stockbrokerage had developed. This man later introduced Gardner to many managers of stock brokerage firms. The fired manager from E.F Hutton was one of them.While he was still cleaning floors, roofing and cutting grass, he took appointments with these managers and tried to convince them in every meeting to grant him a seat in their training programs.His continuous efforts had paid off when he was considered for a training program at Dean Witter Reynolds’ stock brokerage firm. But his stars were so playing against him, that he got jailed for 10 days for accumulating parking tickets worth $1200 in a high security prison for criminals. With a phone call from prison, he had managed to convince some big guy at Dean Witters that he would be joining two days later as he got entangled with some urgent work.As the training program at DWR didn’t offered any salary, he was depleted of livelihood. He lost his abode. His wife had left him with his son, only to return after 4 months to keep his son with him. Homeless, devastated with lack of financial resources, and with the burden of responsibility of his child, Gardner and his son ate whatever they could, wherever they could. They ate in soup kitchens and charity halls. They took shelter in church, slept in parks and flophouses(generally the size of office cubicle rooms), hid under his desk after office and also shut themselves in railway bathroom. With whatever money he saved(he sold his medical equipments), he paid for his son’s daycare.Gardner, after all this, passed the training with flying colours and also got a job at Bear Stearns and Company in San Francisco. A turning point in his life.He had made it through!The coming years saw Gardner rose to great heights . He bought his own house and own Ferrari. His career rapidly ascending into the stratosphere, in 1987 he opened his own investment firm, Gardner Rich.Today Mr Gardner, 64, is worth an estimated $60m (£48m), travels the world as a motivational speaker, and sponsors a number of homeless charities and organisations that combat violence against women.Will Smith played Chris Gardner in Gardner’s biopic “The pursuit of happyness”Mr. Gardner you are a living legend and your journey is a motivation. Its an honour to write an article on you!What lesson his journey teaches:-Success comes to those who dare and act.Happiness is not cheap and affordable. One has to pursue happiness.Thanks for reading","I would like to share the story of one such interesting personality, He even plays an role in the upcoming movie Avengers:Infinity War, his life set a great example for all us.Wait here is the proof of the cast list from avengers.His life story…Last but not the least…Footnotes:Must watch motivational speech by Peter Dinklage.Don't wait for the world to tell you that you are ready, show it , do it.Thank you"
CAT,CAT or GMAT which one is tougher?,https://www.quora.com//CAT-or-GMAT-which-one-is-tougher,"Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",56,"Do you have domestic plans or international plans?Do you carry actual work experience?Can you spare your time for T.I.M.E?How do I score 750+ on GMAT?Ans: GMAT is super easy. You can take the GMAT exam max 5 times in 1 year. You can take each exam after every 16 days as per GMAC's new policy. I know it does take $250 (~Rs.16000) for each exam you take. Just remember that this exam is gonna decide your career and a very high GMAT score will fetch you a guaranteed 30%-50% scholarship as an international student. Top B-schools can track your record of each attempt you made to pick up the best score you earned. I'd suggest not more than 3 scored attempts and the score remains volatile for 3 years. Try to get at least 3 years of work experience (actually speaking, you need 5 years of Work Ex to become a very strong contender) and since you've got a lot of time, why not prepare from Day 1 instead? This is how a normal guy would think right? However, to prepare and crack a super competitive exam like GMAT there is no need for a tuition class and you don't need to prepare heavily for 3-5 years for this exam.You just need to subscribe for an online course (gmat.magoosh.com or gmatprepnow.com)and try to solve 40-50 Questions everyday for a period of 75 days for Math and Verbal lessons with 109 secs on stopwatch for each Qsn. Try 50 Qsns x 100 Secs = 5000 secs everyday's mental pressure i.e. 90 mins of mental football everyday for the next 75 days w/o half-time.Analyze your score.Improvize on the weak areas. It will take a month's time to refresh your Math and Verbal skills via tutorials.Plus, you do not want to waste and wait for 1 year for the CAT exam.GMAT is accepted in most B-Schools in India (even IIM-A/B/C/.......but only for top 1%-2% candidates).If you are currently pursuing your Bachelors degree i.e. if you are in 2nd or 3rd or 4th year engg., you must take a look at ISB's YLP program. Talk to the AdComs i.e. Admissions Committee for the median cut-off for undergrads. A score of 700 on GMAT would do the trick in Stage2.IIM-A/B/C median GMAT score is 750+ (but the FPM doctoral program has 680+ ->  48Q and 39V minimum for FPM admission i.e. >87th %ile).If you are an Indian, you must have at least 4 years of work ex and 730+ on GMAT for IIM-Bangalore (check this coz the competition here is too stiff).Go for EPGP and save your 1 year (-: It is a 720 hrs intensive program as against 960 hrs of its flagship PGP program.If you are an offshore candidate and did your MS abroad (>= 18 months program), you can send your GMAT score of 710+ for IIM-Bangalore (as of 2015) for 2 years PGP program (very good for networking).XLRI's median GMAT score is 680-690 i.e. >85th %ile.No shortcuts to XAT for BM via GMAT.If you have 2+ years of Work Ex, wait for 1 more year and aim for Global MBA  orIf you have 4+ years of Work ex, wait for 1 more year and go for GMP.Be ready with your GMAT score by 15th December for XLRI.ISB Hyderabad GMAT median score is 700+ i.e. >89th %ile.It is a 700 hrs intensive 1 year PGP program.Again, minimum 2 years of Work ex would suffice for ISB.(people generally have 4-5 yrs of work ex here.....So, if you have just 2-3 yrs of work ex, you need to earn a very high score on GMAT for sure).For ISB, be ready with your GMAT score by 15th October for Round1 or 15th Jan for Round2.If you are from Mumbai:SP Jain (650+)SJMSOM - IIT Bombay (700+)NMIMS (600+)Welinkar (600+).....All accept GMAT and will fetch you â‚¹.100k/month package for sure (-:but IIM Bangalore's package would be â‚¹.200k/month. So, rethink again!!!The beauty of GMAT is that you can mentally prepare yourself with 1 month's preparation and crack the exam with 700+ score. I'm talking about 150,000+  out of 1.29 million people cracking the 700+ score (equivalent to 89th percentile score) in the past 5 years:http://magoosh.com/gmat/2014/wha...Now, imagine if you want to crack the score of 700+ and hope for an admit to top 10 universities in USA, you'll have to go beyond 710-720 score to get a Wharton/MIT/Stanford/Yale call .....depends upon your MBA aspirations. Yes if you have a vast amount of Work ex, you can score low on GMAT i.e. 680-720.Remember, I said that it is much easier to study with your own pace and crack the GMAT in 2 months time and get a 750 score....every student competes with nearly 5000 applications in a university (Top15 B-schools) for getting an admission according to the specialization.....again depends.CAT needs 5-6 months of preparation (but you have to wait for 1 whole year for this exam) and if you aspire to have an IIM tag on your belt just to show the world that you are the Man, you can choose to give your CAT, get mentally set for the 99th percentile score and in the meantime you can easily give GMAT a try for 1 or 2 attempts :)Likewise, GMAT is awesome. Verbal has SC-CR-RC with 13-14/14-15/19-22 marks respectively. So, anyone who scores 13-14-19 on Verbal SC-CR-RC, will be on a high scorer bracket. Quant goes with 40% DS and 60% PS i.e. 15 and 22 Qsns approx. respectively. Math has no Graphs/Calendar/patterns logic/hard Functions....no Calculus and DI(except for 12 IR Qsns). It's purely logical.GMAT can be cracked with your own pace. CAT needs a lot of time. A lot of patience!GMAT Verbal will kill you for sure. But it gets more interesting when you try to solve a couple of hundred Qsns from each section :)There are 8 x 3 topics for Quant, SC and CR.See the pic below:â€‹So, there are around 30 topics in total that you need to master in 100 days right?For Quant, OG content + Magoosh + Manhattan is enough.If you are really really weak on the Verbal part, start with the foundations -Nautical Miles by IMSorWord Power Made Easy by Norman&LewisorManhattan MGMAT Foundations of Verbal book.You have tons of Apps in the App Store for pocket prep.Try these:Official GMAT app by gWhiz (in-built Timer + Reset button),Prep4 GMAT app by MIT guys (a very comprehensive app),Veritas Question Bank app (has 250 quiz qsns...50 for each),Complete GMAT Video Course app by Veritas prep,GMAT ToolKit 2 app for flash cards,Magoosh GMAT Math app, GMAT idioms app for flash cards,Pocket GMAT app by Manhattan for flashcards(For more flashcards, go to beatthegmat.com website),Pranayama app (for 5 mins mind yoga) andTimer+ app (stopwatch).The GMAT online forum community helps you a lot. Only 2 main active GMAT best forums in the market with over 10 years of expertise are gmatclub.com and beatthegmat.comDon't even think to go beyond that (-:So, log in and skim through the entire website rightaway.Become a silent observer of top main moderators (e.g. Bunuel and bb on gmatclub.com) and top members and followers on both the forums (-:Try to solve at least 10 mocks that are available for free for the 1st attempt (from Manhattan MGMAT, Veritas Prep, The Economist, Kaplan, 800score, Platinum GMAT, http://litesee.com/gmat.htm for verbal, Princeton Review, gmatclub.com and the actual GMATPrep s/w that includes 4 actual simulation tests of the GMAT exam ) and try to supplement it with an online course such as magoosh.com or gmatprepnow.com (hardly takes $99 for Magoosh and $0 for gmatprepnow).Buy the actual Quant Review and Verbal Review from GMAC.(buy it from amazon.in ;) save â‚¹300)Wiley, the publisher, provides you an online access to solve the same Qsns which allows you to simulate real GMAT exam mode online (-:Buy Question Pack1 from the mba.com (takes $30).Now, see the pic below:Total = around 3000 Qsns here.If you follow my chart shown below, you'll get your dream score for sure.Byheart this chart and solve these Qsns 2-3 times.Maintain your Error Log:GMAT Error Logs - Free Tools for your GMAT StudySo, say if you want to crack GMAT in 100 days, take out the entire column and divide it by 100 i.e. try to solve 6 DS 9 PS 5 SC 4 CR 1 RC passage per day. Try to go step by step. 1st complete Magoosh in 20-25 days and then touch the OG content and then touch your laptop with GMATPrep QsnPack1 practice. At this modest rate, you can easily cope up with 34-35 Qsns/day. Take rest on Sundays. This is really important. Don't budge. Complete the entire practice set and you'll feel confident enough to crack the mocks after 50 days for sure. Why 50 days? Remember, 3000+ Qsns are actually hidden in the mocks as well. So, double or triple your speed as per your capacity to digest that kind of data in your head. Keep that hunger and solve 20 mocks at least :)Don't forget to solve Manhattan MGMAT Qsns(I've not mentioned here in my chart) for SC and it really helps to crack the SC section if you could download ""Thursdays with Ron"" which is entirely for free (-:It has 50+ videos till date with more than 80+ hrs of online coaching content and get a high speed internet connection for downloading this 15 GB of awesome Verbal content or stream it as you wish:http://www.manhattanprep.com/gma... Do check this for consolidated files:http://gmatclub.com/forum/update...You don't need to go for an actual mentor coaching because the online part covers everything and the forums will help you solve your doubts quickly (-:These are 2 eBooks with 200 pgs of awesome content that you must read: SC Tips eBook from Prep4GMAT by MIT guys (-:SC eBook from Magoosh's blog for idioms (-:Even if you are not satisfied with your official CR content and are really hungry for more, go for Powerscore CR bible, Powerscore RC and the Official LSAT SuperPrep......You'll have to dedicate another 100 days to cover this entire topic (2000+ Qsns) if you are weak in CR or RC. Actually speaking, you need to really do the OG content and feel each CR Qsn thoroughly. For RC, you'll have to improve your english skills if you are a non-native. This means that you'll need to read NYT/The Economist/ The Hindu or play with fiction novels. You do realize that these great authors and highly paid writers have strong vocab skills embedded with years of practice and perfection....I am Marathi. I sucked at verbal with 30-34 initially. And I have read 570+ novels and 10,000s of articles. So, daily I journalize my stuff. Keep this habit and you'll understand how I could crack GMAT in 72 days. It is not by magic. You need to hone your logical reasoning skills.For RC- Don't be bleakly emotional with the cognitive content. If you keep on doing the same RC passages or skim it twice or thrice then you are certainly weak on RC. Familiarity breeds contempt!! But stay focussed for at least 100 days and you can crack your Verbal with a perfect 43/44/45 (-: You know, you don't need a TOEFL score if you have a strong Verbal score on GMAT (-: But give it anyway coz you need to convince your Visa interviewer to make him/her happy.For those who are struggling with Verbal and want to catapult your score, invest in e-GMAT subscription for $199. I never tried it but my friends told me it is cool for a non native.Would suggest T.I.M.E for CAT for sure ....no doubt about that!Full-time faculty members @T.I.M.E are really naive to not to give GMAT and  guess what, GMAT Math is 3 times easier than what I experienced from CAT but GMAT Verbal is 3 times difficult.......nobody might have told you that right (-:Also, nobody might have whispered this to you:GMAT calculates past 3 years percentile scores i.e. close to 22 Lakh scores.CAT just calculates current year percentile scores i.e. close to 2 Lakh scores.http://www.mba.com/india/the-gma...(For example, Yale SOM last year's admission was for 710-720. Now, because so many took the GMAT and many scored beyond 720, the median cut-off for Yale is now 720+ as of 2015 which was 710+ as of 2014!!!)More than 1.29 million people took the GMAT exam in the past 5 years and more than 3.72 million score reports were sent.So, %ile scores are really hard to earn these days.A GMAT score of 750 used to be 99th %ile score in 2005,Now, 750 is considered as 98th %ile score in 2015.That's okay!! You don't need a 750 score. You just need to get beyond 720....Q50,V40 will easily fetch you a Top10 B-school call :)So, if you are intelligent enough to decide for yourself, you might say both exams are super tough.GMAT focusses mainly on Verbal and CAT focusses mainly on Math.For those who really don't understand:AWA (nothing but an argument's analysis = 30 mins)+ IR(hard mix of 12 Qsns i.e. 33-39 sub-Qsns from Quant+Verbal = 30 mins) + Quant (37 Qsns = 75 mins)+ Verbal(41 Qsns = 75 mins)= GMAT :)AWA can be done in 1 session :) Easiest section on GMATHow to get 6.0 AWA....my guide... byheart the template a million times.IR needs crazy reasoning skills.Quant is easy.Verbal can chew up your score into pieces...!!!The exam is for 3.5 hrs. So, visualize your cockpit (-:Keep 10 days reserved for taking mocks prior to your GMAT exam (-:If you are a novice beginner, I'd say 100 days to GMAT or 200 days to CAT.If you are an intermediate, I'd say 75 days to GMAT or 150 days to CAT.If you are an expert, I'd say 60 days to GMAT or 120 days to CAT.In conclusion, if you can crack GMAT with 760, with an extra effort on the Math, you can easily crack CAT with 99.99%ile.My Total Cost for GMAT : approx. Rs.36000 /- (buy books from amazon.in itself, it is actually cheaper than flipkart ;))1. GMAC's Official Guide with 900 Qsns for Rs. 11002. GMAC's Quant Review and Verbal Review books with 600 Qsns for Rs.15003. GMAC's Study collection for Rs.4600 (QsnPack1 with 500 Qsns and ExamPack1 with 4 genuine mocks = $72) from mba.com....You have to practice this on laptop/PC.4. gmat.magoosh.com with 900+ Qsns takes Rs. 6300 ($99 premium purchase) and includes 1 mock test.5. Manhattan MGMAT books for Rs. 3200 (only SC/CR/RC) with online access to 6 hard mocks. Also, buy Foundations of MGMAT Verbal and Advanced GMAT Quant = Rs.2000.6. GMAT exam fee is  $250 i.e. Rs.16,300.Plus, I borrowed the Powerscore CR Bible, Powerscore RC and Official LSAT Superprep from my mentor. So, I saved ~6000 bucks (-:Note : Schedule your exam date 2 months prior to your GMAT.Well yes, if you happen to stumble upon GRE, you can download ETS.org's free Powerprep s/w and you can check which exam is better by simulating both the GMATPrep s/w and PowerPrep test s/w......each has 2 mocks for free (-:Tip -> Judge both the exams after studying at least for 1 month prior to taking any simulation test.Both exams are accepted by MBA programs as well.Mostly for Masters/PhD, you take the GRE exam.Mostly for B-schools for MBA (or a relevant PhD), you take the GMAT exam.What is the GMAT equivalent GRE score?Check this:http://www.ets.org/s/gre/flash/b...GMAT Total score = -2080.75 + 6.38*GRE Verbal Reasoning score + 10.62*GRE Quantitative Reasoning scoreThe regression equations:GMAT Verbal score = -109.49 + 0.912*GRE Verbal Reasoning scoreGMAT Quantitative score = -158.42 + 1.243*GRE Quantitative Reasoning scoreSo, V164 minimum on GRE = V40 on GMATand Q168 minimum on GRE = Q50 on GMAT.So, a GRE score of 333 = GMAT score of 750+..'. GRE score of 327 = GMAT score of 700.Note: If you want to send your score for Top10 B-schools, try to get 330+ on GRE.Top B-schools won't tolerate your score after your 3 scored attempts on GMAT and if you've failed to get a good score on GMAT even after 3 scored attempts, I'd say switch to GRE if you are really in a hurry bcoz application deadlines are near and you've exhausted your 3 scored attempts on GMAT already (coz you know each scored attempt can be tracked by Top B-schools).ETS and GMAC are two separate entities now (-:The world is full of possibilities (-:Tips :Try ginger soup coz it raises your heartbeat (-:2 months leave  from  Work/Job (very important step to stay in focus for modus operandi)Now, try to take 10 days out and just auto-play all 300+ video lessons from Magoosh. Quant has some 180 video lessons and Verbal has some 125 video lessons. During these 10 days, don't practice any questions. Just enjoy the content. I completed the entire video lessons in 6 days and I re-played it again and again till I felt confident. Now solve 512 Quant questions and 425 Verbal questions separately. My entire time on Magoosh's website was 31 hrs. Why 31 hrs? bcoz I solved it thrice. All 900+ Qsns and diagnostic test as well. I just loved the Dashboard concept and Customize your practice filters.Solve OG 10th edition 1st and then solve the OG latest edition.People are really naive and don't know how to navigate a forum.

Put 1min 49 secs for all SC/CR/DS/PS Questions and 2-3 mins for the RC passages (90 secs for SC .....to save time for CR and RC during the real exam and 2-3 mins per IR Qsn).Observe the moderators here. Bunuel's posts on gmatclub.com for his ""signature collections"" especially for Quant practice serves best. You'll get another surprise attack of 1000+ Quant Qsns here :-)Do not throw any topic for option!! (as we used to do in our college days..!!!!)Have a self disciplined approach and do not corrupt your mind by watching tons of movies or TV series. Remember that GMAT is a matter of 100 days of study....thats it!!Hydrate your body well. Sleep for at least 8-9 hrs daily for the next 2 months followed by a short nap. REM sleep can do wonders (-:Finally, motivate yourself by comparing B-schools on mba .com's awesome School Finder Tool. Jot down the application deadlines of your dream B-schools and be prepared with LORs, SOPs and Essays for each B-school. Normally people apply in Round 1 and Round 2.For Round 1, be ready by end of August because at least 30%-40% seats are reserved for the 1st pool of applications. For Round 2, be ready with your score by end of December because your GMAT median score might not be upto mark and you really needed some more time. So, for getting an admission abroad, do your research 18 months well in advance :)Never ever apply in Round 3 because seats are already filled up. Hardly 5%-10% seats will be available and tons of people will fight for the same. So, better clock for Round 1 after few months :)I was shitting my pants after I scored 390 570 680 720 on the simulation mocks from GMATPrep s/w !!!...All you need to do is to be technically sound with the GMAT format....The way GMAT tests you and the way you need to test the GMAT (-:OG 10th Edition contains 441 Quant PS Qsns(136 are new), 274 DS Qsns (124 are new) and Verbal (SC-268 + CR-205 + RC-50+ Passages) 700+ Qsns.Get your Manhattan's MGMAT 10 study guides (or only verbal).I've never touched Nova or Kaplan or Barrons or etc. shit!!Every person will tell you a very different story on their roadmap to ace GMAT.....that is what you have to judge for yourself!!Some people will kiss Veritas prep, some will go for Economist Tutor (â‚¹.30k), some will go to youtube to crash their minds and some minds will crash and stick to Youtube playlists.....my sincere suggestion to you is: research more or stick to what I've said :)A bit more advice: Don't join T.I.M.E. or Byju's or Jamboree or Manhattan/Veritas classroom tutoring. These people will tell you what you already know. You just need cool resources and materials and proper time management which I've already discussed with you. Streamline your goals.So, you know for sure that with OG 10th edn, you can easily add 1000 Qsns to the Chart + 3000 Qsns from Mocks (1687 Qsns pool from GMATPrep s/w) + 1000s of extra Qsns from Manhattan + 3000 Qsns from my chart!!So, in all, you'll have to solve nearly 7500+ Qsns to get 750+ on GMAT and do not forget to solve it 2-3 times!!I should write a book on this thingy coz I've cracked it with a 750 score on the GMAT with 72 days of preparation. That is okay as compared to CAT with 140 days of preparation (again depends on your pace and patience).Just 10 weeks of hard work (unlike 20 weeks for CAT)!! I never tried Veritas prep's 6 mocks for $49 or gmatclub .com's 31 tests for $80.You don't need all of that to saturate your head.Even if you buy only 1 Manhattan MGMAT book (say SC) for Rs.1000, you can get an online access to all 6 hard mocks that will be valid for 1 year.Well some last tips:1. AWA score >= 5 and IR score >= 5 .....for Top10 B-schools.2. According to GMAC's new policy, you can cancel your GMAT score report if you think you have performed very badly during the test and you won't have to face the same Qsn on the day of your interview with the top B-school. This also means that if you are determined to crack GMAT in 1 year, you can give this exam and cancel the score 4 times and the B-schools won't notice anything. Well, trust me. You don't need that kind of attempts. At least, you can play the game for the 5th time ;)3. Also, since you know that GMAT is an adaptive test, you must be super alert and focussed to solve the 1st 10 Qsns on GMAT Quant section and the 1st 10 Qsns on GMAT Verbal section correctly during the test. If your initial Qsns are correct and you get 4-5 Qsns wrong at the end of Quant section and 4-5 Qsns wrong at the end of Verbal section, it really doesn't matter. You'll still score 700+ on GMAT.4. Carry a 100gms glucose biscuit and 1 fruit and 1 litre juice/water with you at the time of your GMAT exam and do not forget to wear a sweater because you'll be giving the exam @24Â° C for nearly 226 mins (You'll be given 8 mins break after 1 hour of AWA+IR and 8 mins break after Quant section). At the end of your exam, the GMAC portal will ask you whether you want to keep your score.... So, make this as a #1 thumb rule: Cancel your score report blindly if you don't get a 700+ score on the day of your GMAT exam!! Trust me, this will not only make your heart feel stronger but it will also make you feel more powerful the next time you hit the exam center.Some things I have not told you yet:5000 secs for everyday practice also means that you should give 10000 more secs to review the same (-:I did my entire practice on iPad coz it's sleek. Except for the Study Collection i.e. QsnPack 1 + ExamPack 1 which I did on my laptop.I personally made it sure that I completed at least 70 Qsns as per day's target.My max was 120. So, if you cannot keep up with your pace, you cannot rest on Sundays that is for sure. And I also confess the fact I sequestered myself in my room for 2 long months :-* It chafed me to be confined like this....but ultimately it paid off at the end!!Download ""GoodReader"" app. Now, download previous OG 12th Edition or 13th Edition in PDF format. Now, create an annotated copy and use Highlighter so that you can track your page by page progress and bookmark that page daily.Say, your MGMAT CAT's 6 mocks avg. score = 670 or 680. Well, actually you'll easily get 720-730 score on the real GMAT exam.If you score 710 on the GMATPrep s/w, your actual score on the GMAT will be +10 or -10 i.e. 700 or 720. This software is really precise.In total you'll have 20 mocks: 4 GMATPrep s/w + 6 MGMAT CATs + 10 Free mocks that I mentioned earlier. So, just focus on your Qs and Vs.e.g. IIMs want 49/50/51 on Quant and 43/44/45 on Verbal.For IIMs, you can keep your GMAT score for 2 years (in case you are busy with your international client or you decide to start working on your Startup idea before joining an IIM).And do not hesitate to give your GMAT for a 2nd or 3rd attempt.You know, some B-schools will easily give you a 100% scholarship.Read this:http://blogs.economictimes.india... ....This girl from India got $80000 scholarship and was cordially invited by Cox B-school in the USA.So, just imagine her total MBA financial outlay for subsistence would be very nominal for 2 years including Living/Rent/Utilities/Health insurance/etc....and this is the reason mostly Indian students opt for GMAT for abroad generous scholarships from B-schools.For Canada, Top 5 B-schools have GMAT score requirement of 650-700 only. So, if you score low on GMAT, don't destroy your hopes :) You can still immigrate to Canada in 3 short years :)OrIf your budget is really low i.e. ~$50k, I'd suggest go for MS in MIS only if you are a curious CS grad interested for a career in management in IT in USA or abroad elsewhere (you can work as a Software developer or in Operations or Analyst or etc. with a degree in MIS). MIS mainly requires a GMAT score and it becomes affordable to choose a cool university for the same coz you also know that most MIS programs are STEM related and will give you 2.5 years on OPT (unlike 12 months OPT for MBA). Here, you can save upto â‚¹.5 Lakhs on internship and literally complete your higher education under â‚¹.20 Lakhs abroad if you get a TA/RA i.e. Teaching Assistantship/Research Assistantship (So, shed a good conduct on your Professor and publish a research paper on your topic of specialization before you write your essays for admission).OrGo for a affordable Masters program in the USA (that requires a GMAT score) and after OPT if you find yourself lucky to win a H-1B cap/lottery, you can ask your Employer to fund your Part-time i.e. Weekend MBA program while you are still working on H-1B visa :) Your GMAT score will be still valid and you must use the score for a 2nd time for your MBA. So, tracing your timeline is really essential for this to happen. Alternate way: On OPT you can easily save upto $50k. So, all you need is another $50k. This $50k can be waived with scholarship via high GMAT score. A part-time MBA will take 3 years for completion. It is the same MBA degree (like a traditional/Full-time degree) but this time you won't have to worry about any loan/co-applicant or your Dad's help (-: and the best part is that you'll earn & learn at the same time.OrIf you are a stereotypical engineer or someone who is currently in the pre-final year of your graduation and you have zero Work Ex but if you have a stellar profile, go for Deferred admission: HBS 2+2/ Yale Silver Scholars program/ Stanford GSB deferred enrollment/ Chicago Booth Scholars program/ ISB Young Leaders Program/ IESE Young Talents program/etc. A high GMAT score would certainly increase your chances. What is this program about? It is the same MBA degree but you get to enroll in the 1st year directly after your undergraduate degree. For the next 2 years you'll have to work and in this way, you not only get B-school approved skillset but you also get a guarantee to comeback quickly after 2 years of Work Ex to complete your MBA (In short, if you ask me, you save your 2-3 years of your life since your competition will be with guys with minimum 4-5 years of work ex and you'll stand out to be the best candidate engaged with proper skills when you enter the 2nd year of the MBA program after 3 years).OrIf you've only completed your Bachelors degree, you can directly get into a fully funded PhD program (without the need for a Masters degree) from a reputed University anywhere in the world. A high score on GMAT would be required. So, here's another reason why you would like to spend 5+ years on a research to get an experience with a cool stipend. Why PhD? Coz you can self-petition for your EB2 visa (with tons of research papers) and you can also ask 3-4 employers to petition your H-1B visa in the USA. So, people who really know this directly apply for a doctoral program without giving it a 2nd thought (research more to get a mentor for your R&D in your specialization).For those looking for a Top B-school abroad and need a funding without a collateral/co-signer, just take a loan from Prodigy Finance: http://prodigyfinance.com to pay your entire MBA fees with a cool EMI over a period of 10 years. Hats off to this community initiated by INSEAD+LBS guys :)See, just motivate yourself with such articles and try to get 100% scholarship.Remember, 111-117 Qsns is what will decide your fate on GMAT :)The more you rely on unofficial content, the more you will become vulnerable to a bad score. Magoosh is just for brushing up your skills via tons of tutorials and practice Qsns. And finally, just trust Manhattan blindly bcoz I say so :)And because of the new GMAC's policy, what used to be 89th %ile score i.e. 700 on GMAT...would be 85th %ile in no time. So, quickly register to give the GMAT and keep a 100 days target :) and don't waste your precious time to join any stupid coaching classes....they will mess up your head even more!!!and let's say if at all you need Tuition coaching = 30k goneand let's say you are poor in verbal....e-gmat = 13k goneFor practice.....Magoosh = 6.5k goneFor learning....Manhattan MGMAT Study Guides = 10.5k goneFor official content.....Official Guides + Study Collection = 7k goneFor mocks....let's say you picked gmatclub.com's 33 mock Tests = 5k goneand let's assume you gave the GMAT exam thrice = 50k gone.'. Total = 125k gone.See, it becomes very expensive.Don't bother.Just keep an eye on your golden ticket to B-school via 100% scholarship, which can be upto $80k or about â‚¹.50 Lakhs. That's massive and generous!!Think of it (â‚¹.125k) as an investment in your future.Think of it as the last resort to spearhead your career.What you need is a high level fidelity to Math and English.So, be a lone wolf and try to be as fresh as a duke while studying ;-)Below is a GMAC research data report of past 10 years:Google: ""World Geographic Trend Report for GMAT Examinees""I've saved your efforts....check this:3.72 million Score reports Ã· 1.29 million students = avg 2.8 times!!.'. Each examinee attempts for a 2nd or 3rd time after taking the GMAT exam to earn a very high score to secure an admit to his/her dream B-school....as per new GMAC's policy, you can take the GMAT 5 times in 1 year.Can you do that for CAT in 1 year???Do you have the flexibility such as Round 1 or Round 2 application deadlines for top B-schools in India via CAT??Do you really want to get a -ve score after you hit a wrong option(CAT)??Can you build your accuracy for the non-MCQs with at least 75 marks(25 Qsns) on CAT with exactly 150 secs per Qsn in your hand??Can you beg for a cool scholarship (>=50%) with your CAT score?Plus, can you keep CAT score for at least 2-3 years??You have to actually wait for 1 whole year to take the CAT exam!!Then you start thinking 1st 6 months rest & then next 6 months CAT prep.Lol.....So, people who are lucky to read this post, dedicate 1st 6 months to crack GMAT. Next 6 months to CAT :)Remember, >95th %ile score (>720) for GMAT and >99th %ile score (>200) for CAT :)Here's a GMAT score chart. If you are aspiring for top B-schools, I'd say paste this chart above your head where you sleep and just dream about this triangle for the next 100 days (-: Your eyes should target V40 and Q50 (at the minimum).â€‹GMAT wiki search result:The GMAT does not measure business knowledge or skill, nor does it measure intelligence. According to the test owning company, the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving abilities, while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success.Coming to CAT:Didn't look at NCERT Std 6th to Std 12th books.Didn't do Arun Sharma a favor.Had no time at all for T.I.M.E. coaching (coz I was working) nor I wanted to get crammed with 40 people in a room which is supposed to be a room for a batch of 30 people.Have a really great shortcut to crack CAT....Career Launcher has Test series.Enroll with CAT TS+TG (Test Series + Test Gym) product:http://www.clexams.com/You have to shell off â‚¹.4000 for the same.Now, you must get hooked to CLexams.com portal for at least 100 days.It had cost me an entire day to figure out how the fuck should I approach to crack 8500 Qsns.So, made a really cool chart yet again:â€‹Tests pe Tests....Turns out Test Gym has 741 Tests in total.Test Gym Lite has:276 Tests for Quant.100 Tests for DI/LR.365 Tests for Verbal.31 full-length mocks and 45 sectional tests + 24 more from Test Gym Classic.Keep last 15 days for mocks. Again, go step by step. Complete 10-12 tests per day. Bookmark those hard ones.For pocket prep....download the MBA Exams Guide app from the Playstore.1 Test = 7 Qsns..'. 10-12 Tests = 70-84 Qsns per day's target.So, don't be gobsmacked coz it takes ~15 mins to solve a single Test.Again, don't forget to reset everything and solve it twice and thrice.Do the above and you'll get 99.99 %ile for sure.I made this decision coz I already gave the GMAT and I was strong with my Verbal and Math skills and most importantly, I was mentally set for solving those 8500 Qsns.And don't worry about getting a 99 %ile in your CL mocks.CL mocks are much tougher than the actual CAT exam.All Qsns are neatly refined to ace your CAT exam.So, even if you get 85-90 %ile in the CL mocks that would easily culminate into a 99th %ile score on the day of your CAT exam :-)So, be happy that you can actually ace the CAT in just 4000 bucks.Okay, I exaggerated a bit. You need â‚¹.2000 to buy Arun Sharma books.And download NCERT books too :)Do remember this: CAT will hit you with minimum 25 non-MCQs. Also, the concept of LR on CAT is pretty hard and you won't get enough time to solve 12 Qsns on LR. So practice real hard.(So, if you could get 15 Qsns correct in each section i.e. VA, DI/LR & QA you'd end up with a 90th %ile score on CAT. But if you can score 22-23 Qsns correctly in each section, you'd get a 99th %ile score....that's my analysis).Warning: Don't skip NCERT and Arun Sharma books if you have not given the GMAT exam 1st and you just wanna give the CAT exam 1st coz you'll have to dedicate 1st 30 days refreshing your skills for CAT Math itself. This is something not to be trifled with leniently. So, slap yourself and re-read my entire post again.Your head will be completely packed with 15000+ Qsns after GMAT and CAT.So, don't play all the cards at once (-:Remember, you still have a full marathon race before you :) From a monetary point of view, if you observe, only 12%-15% people giving CAT can afford to take the GMAT (or there are tons of other reasons for taking CAT.....job/support family/business....for execs/career in India/limited H-1B visas in USA/short OPT period of only 1 year for MBA guys in USA/cannot afford to sacrifice 6-7 years to repay $400k debt to Prodigy Finance if you have a H-1B visa/cannot afford to sacrifice 11-12 long years to repay $400k debt to Prodigy Finance in Indian currency/etc.).Advice on B-school debt by Warren Buffett:GMAT or CAT is not about a formidable challenge. It is about the ability to endure hardship against your sedentary ass!!And before you enter this mad quest just be sure to get at least 20+ genuine verified certifications (e.g. Business Informatics/Venture Finance/Statistics/Entrepreneurship/Innovation/Analytics/Accounting/Leadership/Digital Planning/Marketing/Finance/Strategy/Management/Economics/Operations/Critical Thinking/Creative Writing/Public Speaking/etc.) from Coursera :) to be well ahead of the competition to not to show empathy after a ""failed Startup"" situation in your essays. Trust me, it works even with Harvard ;-)And why I've emphasized on Top10 B-schools?It's an axiom of marketing: Reputation matters!!!And why did I give both the exams?It will take me 3000 more words to write exclusively and prove it to you ""Why not both the exams??"".So, anticipate your death after 25,000 days and just take out 250 days to crack GMAT and CAT.Chao*Best of Luck (-:+1Kudos=Thanks (-:","There is no competition between these two.How can you compare a Hayabusa and a Harley Davidson bike, both are made for different approaches.Similarly a Gmat exam and a Cat exam requires different set skills like-GMAT has an easier quant than Cat.Cat requires you to have a top notch academic background.A coaching institute of CAT in India will require you to study for various other exams conducted by private b-schools to which makes your study harder and this takes 12â€“15 months of studies.The % of people in India taking GMAT exam are times less than people appearing for Cat.The above point makes the Cat exam tougher as you need to top among the toppers for your entry in top Indian B-schools.But the story does not end here because a CAT exam may be tougher on paper but GMAT takes the toughness to another level.CAT has a nominal fees of 2,000 approx but if you are not a general category your exam will be done within 1,000/- Rupees only. On the other hand GMAT exam will tear you savings if you are not financially strong i.e it requires a sum of 16,000 rupees for one exam (if you want to give it 5 times in a year be ready to starve)The CAT exam is conducted by Indian Authorities only in and for India but a caste category person can beat you up with lower score in CAT if you belong to General category. This reservation do not exists in GMAT making it much of a true potential exam.CAT exam is tougher than a GMAT exam but do you know what you have to go through after getting a great score in both.For CAT you have to face an interview in that applied top B-school and if everything goes right then you are in.While GMAT topper has to start his 3â€“4 year journey until they apply to the top B-school. This requires you to have a job experience, good social background, extra curricular enthusiast, an enhanced leadership skill and at last top notch English communication. (This is why GMAT scores are kept valid for 5 years.This is because the foreign schools prefer practical skills than a theoretical knowledge which i thinks India lags somewhere.And last but not the least the expense in foreign colleges is much more than any other college in INDIA. So if you can work hard continuously for at least 5 years then go for it you will definitely get admitted with wavier and scholarships.","The Graduate Management Admission Test, popularly known as GMAT is probably the most important exam that can help you to get into the best MBA schools across the world. Beginning in 1953, GMAT is conducted by the Graduate Management Admission Council. The scores are accepted by over 2100 schools worldwide and for 5900 programs.Needless to say, this exam is one of the important steps that will help you to get into your chosen B-School. Though the GMAT exam is not the only factor for getting admission in the B-Schools, a good enough GMAT score makes the rest of the admission procedure incredibly easy.The GMAT exam is conducted at regular intervals all over the world and essentially contains four sections â€“ the analytical writing assessment (AWA), Integrated Reasoning, Quantitative and Verbal. The total duration of the test is three and a half hours and one score anything between 200 and 800.Like any other examination, the GMAT has its own challenges. It is one of the toughest MBA entrance tests and the very fact that it gives you access to the Top 10 colleges across the world shows its reach. The best part about GMAT is the fact that it is conducted multiple times in a year and hence a student can decide to take the test anytime depending on when they feel their preparation is up to the mark, unlike most Indian MBA entrance tests.Here are 5 tips on how to up your GMAT game.1. Fix the Test Date after you start preparingThe tendency for students irrespective of which part of the world they belong to is to keep the exam preparations for the last moment. But serious test takers will start preparing long in advance. For the lazy test taker, we suggest that you start preparing first and then later decide the date when you will take the test. If after three months of preparation you feel confident enough to take the test, sign up for the nearest test date. This way you will not wait for the last moment to start preparing. The larger aim of the test preparation comes into play here. Instead of preparing because you have to take the test, you prepare first and then decide to take the test.2. Study continuously, not sporadicallyLike most tests that assess your understanding of a variety of subject matters, you need to be in constant touch with the study material for GMAT as well. It does not help if you start studying mid way and then decide to resume after a weekâ€™s gap. This not only breaks the continuity of your preparation but also makes you forget valuable concepts and techniques. Thus being continuously in touch with your test preparation is needed. A one or two day break is acceptable, but anything longer would only bring down your level of preparation.3. Take a GMAT prep test to see where you standThe GMAT website offers two free prep tests that all test takers can avail. The best way to assess where you stand before you start preparing is to take one of these tests and see the scores and compare them against what you aim to achieve. They give a fair understanding of your current aptitude in GMAT and which ones are your problem areas. The only hazard with these free prep tests is that they are not adapted to empirical, standardized test results and can possibly give you a different understanding of your position. You can also always take the tests available on Princeton, Kaplan, Manhattan etc. and then use a GMAT Score Estimator/Calculator to find your real GMAT equivalent. Once you have started preparing, take as many prep tests as you can because only then can you gauge your own progress. Use your first score as the lowest limit and set a target score. If you prepare right, all the tests that you take must only point towards you reaching the target score.4. Discover your weakness and work on itEvery test taker has their weakness. Some are strong in quant but finds the verbal section problematic. On the other hand, someone may be very strong in verbal but quant is where they require some serious practice. Most people go for coaching classes but since most of these classes focus on both on Quant and Verbal, a person who is strong in one of these benefits from only half the material provided. It is, therefore, preferable to go for one-on-one coaching or study through an online course. It not only helps you to get individual and undivided attention but also allows you to choose what exactly you want to study depending on your need.5. Decide your own time milestonesThe nightmare of every test taker is not being able to finish a test. As children, all of us have had those dreams of time running out and our exam papers being blank. With a time-sensitive test like GMAT, it is quite possible that you might run out of time causing you to take random guesses that would do you more bad than good. The cleverest thing to do here is to see how much time each question will take and then set milestones that you need to achieve. For example, in the quant section, you must reach the seventh question with 60 minutes remaining and the fifteenth question with 45 minutes remaining on the clock. This way if you see you are falling behind early enough, you can speed up and finish the section smoothly.The key to getting a good GMAT score is knowing the right techniques and having the right amount of practice along with good time management skills. This test truly prepares you for the challenges of management career!All the best!Some useful resources:GMAT Prep: Critical Reasoning DecodedB-School Admission: Written Ability Test (WAT) and Personal Interview (PI)","GMAT & CAT have the same syllabus, both deal with Mathematics and English. Both tests complement each other. Preparing for GMAT helps CAT aspirants in verbal, and CAT preparation helps GMAT aspirants in Quantitative Section. Most of the sections in both the tests are common.MBA admission is a steep road. It's important to keep all doors open. It's good to be confident, but there is a thin line difference between confidence and over-confidence. CAT success rate (% of students getting admission in good colleges) is meager. GMAT, on the other hand, opens doors for almost all the global and Indian business schools.One more misconception about GMAT is that it's only for rich. A Business school is not ""Global"" if it does not keep ""Currency Disparity"" in their mind. That's why they offer scholarships to aspirants from lower-valued currency countries. Almost all the Indian students end up getting scholarships to study abroad.Note for Graduation Final Year Students:Business schools accepting GMAT scores need at least 2+ Years work experience. But then also it makes more sense to give GMAT with CAT. The first reason is GMAT score is valid for five years.Secondly, It's much better to have a GMAT score before selecting business schools. It gives time to aspirants to work on their needed profile.Thirdly, Taking out study time is much easier in student life compared to that in job times. Most of the working applicants find it very difficult to take time out for studies.Lastly, CAT success rate is meager compared to GMAT. Till your overall %ile is touching 99, you are not a serious candidate for IIM-A, B & C. And if your %ile is lower than 98%, you have to go for tier-2 B-schools only.GMAT & CAT Section-wise Analysis:Verbal Section  Sentence Correction: Both exams require candidates to spot grammatical errors. There is one manageable difference. GMAT SC is based on American English while CAT SC is based on British English.   Reading Comprehension: The passages in the CAT and GMAT are almost equally cryptic. RC in GMAT is more difficult than that in CAT.  Critical Reasoning: GMAT CR is tougher than CAT CR. If you are prepared for GMAT CR, then CAT CR is a cakewalk.Quantitative SectionCAT preparation will make GMAT Quant a kid's play. The good news is that many CAT topics such as logarithms, trigonometry, calendars, clocks, shares, etc are not tested in GMAT.Analytical writing assessmentGMAT tests your clarity of thinking in this section. It looks for content, the organization of thought process, language skills and writing mechanisms in evaluating the essays. The good news is that the AWA is not a tough section to ace.Visit www.EduShastra.com for more details."

The advantages are for you to judge. I will also try to answer the concern which one of my friend from IIM community has raised.You dont need my answer to know that IIMC is one of the best places to learn management in the country. Joka surely teaches us business management, but it also allows us the opportunity to learn how to go beyond the books when it comes to being a Leader. And that is what makes this place special.From day 1 we live by the spirit of Leaving No One Behind.! We are proud that we leave no stone unturned to support our batchmates and team-mates when they need our help to defeat the odds. The odds may come in the form of exams, placements or sports.

My answer is to help those confused souls.So, I had a discussion then, with few of my exceptionally helpful btech seniors, 1 from IIMA, 1 from B and 2 from IIMC. Coincidentally, all 4 said at the end, would suggest pick IIMC.And I will have to accept that this was the best decision for me.As an outsider to IIMA and Alumnus of IIMC, the only difference I could see was the culture of IIMC and the focused approach to acads at IIMA. And I have learnt that the culture that you inculcate is >> the acads that you go through.With this I assume, I have made it little easier for you to decide, where you would want to go when you are stuck while making the tough choice.","As a current student at IIM C.

I bought my Bengal from her first owner who had to move out of the country for his job. The Bengal is stand-offish and not affectionate/cuddly. My rescue is affectionate/cuddly but nurses on her thigh whenever I pet her, an indication that she was weaned too early. I love them both. My Bengal is very smart - typical of the breed - and often demanding of attention, also typical of the breed, which she lets me know by knocking stuff off my desk and bureaus. I had three Siamese siblings before these two. One lived for 16 years, another for 18, and their sister for nearly 20. I grieve for all of them; they were the sweetest, cuddliest, most affectionate cats imaginable. But I raised them from the age of 6 weeks, held them, cuddled them, sang and talked to them.

CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,"During the analysis of my CAT mock, especially for quant, I am able to solve 22-26 questions, but while taking the mock, I am stuck to 10-12 questions. How can I improve?",https://www.quora.com//During-the-analysis-of-my-CAT-mock-especially-for-quant-I-am-able-to-solve-22-26-questions-but-while-taking-the-mock-I-am-stuck-to-10-12-questions-How-can-I-improve,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",8,"Thanks for A2A Gaurang.You need to read the questions fast in the exam hall. Immediately leave the question if you are not sure of how to solve it post the first reading. Do not try to understand by investing more time on it.Doing this, run through the paper till the end. You would have selected all easy ones for you and solved them. On this ruthless journey to the end, you should bookmark the questions that you think you can solve but can be time consuming. Get back to these question if time permits.If you follow this basic process, you can get up from 10–12 to 18–20 questions. The key lies in not wasting time on the questions that need to be left - the difficult ones for you. Let me illustrate this doing some basic maths.Suppose, you read and double read questions to try to solve them. You read 26 questions - solve 12 and leave 14 after trying to solve them. So, effectively 60/26 => 2.3 minutes per question (assume same time for both solved and unsolved/wrong ones) => 14*2.3 approx 32 minutes wasted.So, the key lies in spending time on those questions which you can solve and immediately leaving the ones that confuse you in the hall. Practice this. Being conscious about fast selection leads to lots of improvement in attempts and accuracy both.My team and I will be discussing mock analysis in details in this free all India mock series for CAT 2018. You can register for this prediction mock series on this link:CAT 2018 Feel CAT SeriesBest wishes!Rahul SirCAT Coachwww.bfactory.in","A2AThe only difference between solving questions after the test and during the test is the accompanying pressure. When you are taking the test, there are stakes involved: you are probably thinking about the score, accuracy, cut-offs and percentile. There are no such distractions once you are attempting the questions with a clearer mind (also, there is no fatigue as would be the case during the test; attempting quant after those 2 gruelling hours is an arduous task, no doubt) and that generally helps focus a bit better.The best thing you can do in this situation is to think of one question at a time and not the macro picture when you are attempting the test. If you tend to count the number of reds and greens when you are solving a question or are obsessively looking at the timer every 30 seconds or so, you would need to break this habit. The best candidates will invariably tell you that they are confident in their ability and that it is their attempt that will define the level of difficulty and not the other way around (in simpler words, if they are unable to attempt a question after a minute of struggle, they are smart enough to understand that more than 90% of the test-taking population won’t be able to solve it and so, skip it without any second thoughts). The key to doing justice to the test lies in being aggressive and fearless when you are solving every question.So, instead of worrying about your mock scores, use the mocks to get better at the actual test. Read the question carefully, solve it using the first method that comes to your mind (if you got nothing in 45 seconds, move on) and do not make any calculation errors. Repeat this 34 times and you should get a better outcome. Sounds arbitrary but it actually works in most cases when content is not an issue (which, I am assuming is true in your case considering that you are able to solve around 70 percent of the test).Hope that helps.","This is a very normal occurrence for quite a few students.It is very natural. This happens because your mind has already seen all the questions and whether you like it or not, the questions or the roadblocks or their concepts lurk in your mind and then when you solve it again, you seem to solve more.In a mock, you look at the questions for the first time and have to read them, absorb them, calculate, process it for the first time. This means that you need time to read, interpret, comprehend, understand and solve the problem.The way to move over this problem is to practice regularly and continuously. Give sectional tests and mocks frequently. This is because it will improve your retention, comprehension and solving speed and skills.If you ever feel that a particular topic and section is becoming tough and that you are repeatedly making mistakes in it, then the best option is to give sectional tests and practice beforehand wherein you read all the concepts, solve all the questions of all the levels of difficulty.For example, I always feel that geometry and P&C have always been my achilles heel. So, if I ever score low in quant or in LR, I double down from Arun Sharma books and the coaching reference books. This gives me confidence and allows me to go over the concepts once again. The surprising thing I have noticed is that many a times there have been cases where I forget few tips and tricks related to the concepts I have already brushed over. I usually then go beyond the trick, have a look at its reasoning and the method for the trick. For example, for finding remainder I always imagine doing it using the binomial theorem — this is because I can never imagine the other tips and tricks. For the mixtures portion, I always go by the LCM approach — this I do because I cannot visualise or calculate using the tricks. So, I know what works for me or what I am able to use.Never stick to one method just because it is easy —- being easy is a very subjective term.All the best!","When we come across with any friendly person, we feel very good. We would like to spend as much time with that person. Those individuals just make us feel extremely comfortable. But life is not a bed of roses. Many a times we have to confront individuals, perceived as not so friendly or may be deadly, whose thought processes are totally diametrically opposite ours. The process of interaction with such individuals, at times, can take an ugly shape of confrontation. We may tend to get so emotionally engrossed that the chances of getting almost intellectually paralyzed are very high. Brain just freezes. Mind goes numb. We may not be able to analyze the things objectively -as expected of a rational being. We just want to win our argument at any cost. And when that does not happen, our pride gets battered and bruised badly.But then, time is a great healer. We may have been pained by that individual/situation. But, over a period of time, we tend to forget that and we just move on with our regular daily set of activities. In fact, many a times, the converse happens. When we analyze those situations (when we are in cool frame of mind), the following thought processes tend to resonate.Oh ! I should not have done that.Oh ! How silly of me.Oh ! Why did i behave so inappropriately with that individual. It was just so ungentlemanly of me !Well, I think I should have behaved in a proper way.Essentially, many a times, when we try and recollect those incidents, we realize that was our own folly. But then, a price has already been paid. We may have lost that individual. But then, it’s life. We will come across with hundreds and thousands of individuals but with mindset different from ours.The fundamental questions are:->“Have we really learned enough from that first nasty confrontation so that the same can be avoided later on”. ?“Are we sure that we will be able to deal with those so called unfriendly individuals in a better way next time”?“Have we really learned from our mistakes “ ?“Can we maintain our cool and calm during pressure like scenarios”And that’s what CAT MOCKs are trying to teach us. The MOCKs are presenting to us lots of situations -some good, some nasty and some utterly disgusting. During the test time, sometimes we are not able to spot a friendly easy question. Instead we tend to spend a lot of time wrestling with a question which should have been ignored on the mere looks of it. But we tend to fight with that during the test time and if we were blessed with infinte time, most likely we would fight with that till eternity.In my last 14 years of coaching for CAT, I had interacted with thousands of CAT aspirants. It is very difficult to say what is a right formula to crack QUANT. What works for one person may not work for the other individual. Everyone is unique. There is no standard formula which can be applied everywhere.When we are writing MOCKs, there is that huge time pressure. We would have to learn as to how to handle that pressure. When we can maintain cool and calm, our ability to spot easy questions and do those correctly will multiply. Further, we will be effective in identifying torturous qs and ignore those quickly. But this brings forth another key point“If we were blessed with excellent time/pressure managment skills, can we do a large number of questions on the basis of those skills alone” ?Well, the answer is plain, simple NO.So, the question is what are those other skills which we should be endowed with and what we should do for that.There are some broad pointers/factors which we should be aware of.During the test time, don’t spend unnecessary amount of time on questions which are difficult. Such questions are meant to be left out. But, Yes !! During preparation stage, one should make a conscious attempt to learn relevant concepts and different techniques for cracking such questions.During the preparation stage, don’t leave out any chapter completely.There are around 25–26 chapters where the questions have been coming across in CAT for the past 10 years. For the sake of convenience, we can divide the entire CAT QUANT portion in two broad categories -1) FRIENDLY areas in QUANT 2) DEADLY areas in QUANTFollowing is a hypothetical scenario. Pls note that what appears “friendly” for one may be “deadly” for other.FRIENDLY Areas in QUANT (for a candidate X):->There are around 7–8 topics which a candidate X may feel comfortable with. Those topics are 1) Simple Equations 2) Ratio, Proportion, Variation 3) Percentages 4) Profit, Loss, Partnership 5) SICI 6) Averages, Mixtures and Alligations 7) Time & Work 8) Time & Distance. These topics are generally “perceived” to be less painful.There were 14–15 questions from the above mentioned areas in CAT 2017If anyone is out of touch with MATHS, the chances are very high that one will like to focus on ONLY the topics as mentioned above.DEADLY AREAS in QUANT(for that candidate X)There are other 15–16 chapters where that canddiate X may not feel comfortable with. These chapters may not appear as friendly as the ones mentioned earlier on. Qs from chapters like 1) Numbers -LCM, HCF, Remainders, etc 2) Geometry 3) Mensuration 4) Special Equations 5) Inequalities 6) Functions & Graphs 7) Coordinate Geometry 8) P&C 9) Probability 10) Indices & Surds 11) Logarithms 12) Trigonometry 13) Number Systems -Binary, Hexadecimal System 14) Quadratic Equations 15) Progressions 16) Statistics are very common place.Last year, there were around 19–20 qs from the above mentioned areas.It’s clear that the candidate X has less exposure. The chances are high that he will spend more time on qs which are from his friendly domain. But the number of qs from such areas will be limited in the exam-may be 15. As a consequence, during the test time, the number of attempts will get restricted to less than 15.And later on we realize that we could have done about 22 qs.Why does that feeling occur.Because, when we are doing that analysis, we are doing in a cool frame of mind. All deadly qs (during the test time) have started appearing friendly (during the analysis time).Let me present to you one example. This question is actually related to “Permutation & Combination”. Sometimes, the very mention of this topic can unsettle even a seasoned professional.Here goes the question.(Difficulty level of the question posed below is left for you to decide for)There are 13 players. Each player plays exactly one match with every other player. Find the total number of matches held.Ans:->When we apply P&C, we can get the answer by applying 13C2. Now, when we are not comfortable with the chapter, we may feel like leaving that question during then exam. But there is other way to look at this question -PATTERN METHOD.Take the following cases.:A, B (Matches held —-> AB)3 Persons:-> A, B, C(Matches held)AB, AC (2)BC (1)Total:-> 1+24 Persons:-> A, B, C, D(Matches held)AB, AC, AD (3)BC, BD (2)CD (1)Total: 1+2 +3 =65 Persons:-> A, B, C, D , E(Matches held)AB, AC, AD, AE (4)BC, BD, BE (3)CD, CE (2)DE(1)Total: 1+2 +3 +4=10Observing the pattern, we can say that the number of matches heldMatches = 1+2+3 +4……+12 = 78Let’s understand the bigger picture. During the exam, there will be easy qs-like the one above (Matches qs) (from so called difficult chapters).So, how do we spot those. During the preparation phase, we have to solve a large number of qs from various chapters so that we are not taken by surprise. Practice and a never say die attitude matters.We need to keep our mind open. Let’s enter the exam hall with our mind clear of any prejudices. If we can do that, CAT should not be a difficult one to crack.You can follow the link below for additional pointers related to CAT QUANT preparation.Rajesh Kumar Saraf's answer to What are some of the important tricks used for solving the quants section in the CAT exam?All the best !!"

This course will help you access any topic anytime and anywhere,hence, providing the freedom of learning as per your need and pace of understanding.Basic Plan:Try to finish the syllabus within October. Devote 3–4 hours per section every day or as per your strengths and weaknesses (i.e., practice the harder ones so that even if you miss practicing the easier ones you can cover it up by taking mocks later).Next take 20 mocks at least. Mocks are the heart of CAT preparation, they help in analyzing your strengths and weaknesses and practice accordingly.For actual CAT level mocks refer “Handa Ka Funda” mock test series.Tips:Solve 5 DI questions and 3–4 RC passages every day. Keep taking sectional mocks daily until you attain the confidence with respect to each section.Spend at least 4 hours for preparation even if you are occupied for the day.Make notes along with practicing questions daily. Any sort of idea or new shortcut should be part of these notes.A quick revision in the early morning of the previous day preparation. This works wonders!Remember self-discipline, dedication, and determination for 60 days can give you more than 6000 days of encouraging life.Above all the things do not let go the fear in you. The fear of losing if in case you don’t work hard today.Hope this helps you.

Important CAT Preparation Tips!As bells start ringing for the approaching CAT exam, all the students want to know How to crack CAT in 2 months? Moreover, with the new pattern of CAT exam, strategies will need to change. The ideal approach to score high in MBA entrance exams is true to the age old saying of “Work hard for what you want because it won’t come to you without a fight.”To bell the CAT, you need to know its nature. There is still no clarification on the proposed changes in CAT pattern.There will be 34, 32, 34 questions respectively in Quantitative aptitude (QA), Data interpretation and logical reasoning (DILR), Verbal and reading comprehension (VRC). Apart from multiple choice questions, there will even be non MCQs.There could be more data interpretation questions or more quant ones. In the second section the questions ratio of verbal ability and reading comprehension against logical reasoning may also change. As there is no official word on this, we have to be prepared for any pattern.The new preparation strategy for CATA lot will be decided by the CAT practice test hosted by IIMs at CAT 2018. Despite taking n number of mock tests by coaching institutes, the final word will be said by this official CAT mock test. We will need to wait a little longer for this to be available though.In our opinion, in the last two months you need to focus on two things – (1) Topic wise revision, (2) Mock tests.It goes without saying that if you have not already started revising, it is high time to do so. Give in more hours in a day, know your strengths and weaknesses, and just give it all.Be prepared for anything and everything!The uncertainty of pattern is wreaking havoc among CAT aspirants. But look at it this way, you are all in the same boat. So rather than preparing based on pattern, prepare for topics. There could be an imbalance in number of questions being divided among sections. But as long as you are equally good in all, it will not make a difference.Divide your time among the two major sections and four sub sections wisely. If you are exceptionally good in one, give it a little lesser time and try to improve the areas you are not so good at. You do not want to lose precious marks in any section!Go back to the basicsThe USP of CAT or any MBA entrance exam is that it does not involve rocket science. The topics are of basic mathematics and aptitude. Aim of any management entrance exam is to test a candidate’s aptitude and problem solving ability. As long as you know the fundamentals like the back of your hand, there is no looking back.Preparing for basic English questions in CAT – To justly increase number of questions and to let students solve them in lesser time, there could be a rise in questions on basic English. This could include more speech, tenses, word formations, phrasal verbs.Logical reasoning – On any given day, LR questions take up more time in a paper. Racing against time, you need to solve LR questions tactically. Remember, incorrect answers will give you a negative score. Practice more questions on seating arrangements, relations, sets, premise and conclusion. Focus on improving your speed and accuracy.Quantitative Ability – Remainder theorem, geometry, number system, PC, probability; these are your friends for life. Or at least for CAT. As a large number of engineering students appear for the CAT exam, it is expected that this section is the most scoring. Like basic english, questions of quant are also expected to be more.Data Interpretation – Learn to visually understand data. Graphs, pie charts, bar diagrams are all information rich data being presented as graphs. Graphs are meant to make things easier to understand. You will need to understand this fact before moving ahead with these questions. DI section is scoring for those who have the knack of breaking down visual data into information.Speed and accuracy – That is all you need to get the perfect score in CAT!Solve questions quickly, and correctly.Rather than trying to learn concepts, you can start doing questions from the beginning.Do not spend a long time in just knowing a concept. Start practicing its approach in questions.Two months before appearing for CAT exam, you must know which are your weak and strong areas.If you are yet unable to understand the weak topics, do not spend a very long time on them.Start further strengthening your strong areas. Try to solve those questions in lesser time.",As per the eligiblity criteria .Yes you can appear for CAT 2018 . As final year appearing students can appear for CAT .Best of luck Go ahead .You are left with a very less time .for any queries Call or Text 8521336635,3rd year which course.?If it is 3rd engineering you are not eligible to write.

CAT,How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-did-99+-percentilers-prepare-for-CAT,"Prepathon, Exam and Test Results, Common Admission Test Percentiles, Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",100+,"My authority on the subject? I scored a 99.75 percentile in CAT, 99.55 in XAT, 99.45 in SNAP. This is a walkthrough of my preparation/ how you can go about preparing for CAT and other entrance exams.CAT is considered to be one of the most difficult entrance exams in India, but it is isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most of the topics that are tested in CAT are High school level topics. The difficulty lies in the fear of the test. Most CAT aspirants resign to an assumption that they can’t score above a certain percentile without even knowing what the test is made off, half the game is lost at this point.I have been guilty of the same myself. Jan 2016, I remember looking at lists of MBA colleges and immediately rejecting the top 30 odd colleges for the fact that they all required you to score above 97 percentile or so to realistically make into those colleges. It was only when I talked to my father and he explained to me the negativity in my thinking, that I realised, I hadn’t even seen what CAT consisted of. I had no logic in leaving out the possibility of scoring an extremely high percentile.Another reason why I felt that I had to score an extremely high percentile were my 12th class marks. MBA colleges give weightage to academic profile. A self-analysis made me realise that having a low score in my 12th class (69%) was a huge handicap. If I had got a low percentile I would’ve found it extremely difficult to make into the colleges of the relevant level. I would’ve ended up in colleges ranked even lower. I had to score a 99+ percentile. BELIEVE you can Crack the CATHow to go about:I have divided the preparation for CAT into four parts:Pre-preparation, Preparation, Practice, Taking the CATPre-PreparationThere are a few things you’ll want to have in place before you start your preparation for CAT and other exams.Find three hours a day (not in bits and pieces here and there) three continuous hours to prepare. This can be extremely difficult if you are working/ attending college. This might help you to find a few extra hours a day.Get rid of any distractions that you believe affect your concentration or mental state in general. (social media is one of the biggest time-suck and tends to distract you even if you aren’t online)Get in touch with someone who has cracked the entrance exam or has some expertise in the same, you could approach a local coaching centre. (you may not enrol as a full-time student but you would want to be in touch with the faculty there by buying their material or tests etc.) This will be helpful in getting certain finner tips and in case you have difficulties.Get yourself a campaign manager. Cracking the CAT and getting an admission into an MBA college is a long drawn process. You are bound to lose interest or forget important things/ deadlines. Get someone who will keep track of the same. For me, it was my father who helped me keep track of my preparation and all the college applications. Make sure the person you chose exactly understands the process and understands what you want. They will make sure that you are still going even when the motivation starts to run out.Read a lot. This is extremely important when it comes to the verbal ability section of CAT. You will need a lot of broad-based readings and an ability to make sense of what you have read quickly. The passages for reading comprehension in CAT are sometimes extremely abstract and can be extremely difficult to make sense if you aren’t used to reading a lot. Places where you should want to read from: Medium, The guardian, Businessweek Bloomberg, Also read some classic novels that you can lay your hands on, the books talked about on crash course literature are a good place to start.PreparationCAT is divided into 3 sections verbal ability reading comprehension, logical reasoning data interpretation, and quantitative ability. Each of the sections requires equal effort and attention.Time for preparation: There are many people and sites who will tell you that you need 14 hours a day to prepare for CAT. Trust me that doesn’t work. You just need 3 to 4 hours a day consistently over a period of 3- 4 months to crack CAT. Anything more than 5 hours a day can and will burn you out.Source material for preparation: A common mistake that most aspirants will make is relying on just one book/ one source for preparation (particularly anyone who takes coaching). It is recommended that you have access to at least some material from different authors. This will provide you with multiple points of view for the same problems. (same goes for mock tests recommended that take at least 4 to 5 tests from A differen source).Verbal Ability & Reading ComprehensionThis is one of the most frustrating sections in CAT. The question often can seem to have multiple solutions and where options are provided all of them seem correct. Even if you are extremely good with English you can end up messing this section.The key to cracking this section (particularly Verbal ability part) is understanding that this section is more about logic than language. You have to understand the logic as to how the solutions are arrived at (jumbled para is the killer in this section).I initially worked this section by looking at the solutions, that way I was able to see what patterns to look out for and what logic to apply.Work on improving your ability to comprehend complex /long sentences, particularly from topics that you aren’t used to and having complex vocabulary.This section will take a lot of practice to master, more practice than the other two sections. This section has the highest returns for scores. If you get a slightly higher score in this section your percentile can increase drastically. (I scored a 99.98 percentile in this section).Even if you have a good command over the language DO NOT take this section lightly, I know of aspirants who have the CAT along with me having excellent command over the language yet messing up this section completely.Data interpretation and logical reasoningData interpretation is a practice intensive section. There is nothing new that you have to learn in this section. It is just the ability to carry out basic calculations using tools you already have (percentages, averages, summation, division). Practice these basic tools thoroughly so that you are extremely comfortable with them. Also get acquainted with all the various forms of data presentation, such as graphs, pie charts, tables, caselets etc.Logical reasoning is a section which you should and can make the most out of it. The questions are very often similar. While practising logical reasoning the things you would want to learn is gauging the difficulty of the question quickly. If a question is difficult, move on to the next one (time is important).You would want to practice visualising the problem (in mind / on paper ) in the simplest way possible. This will help you breakdown huge paragraphs full of seemingly meaningless words into sensible data.Learn to have an unbiased mind. One of the mistakes you can make in this section is assume somehting that isnt true. Learn to use all the information provided and only than make any conclusion.Read the data carefully a single word can change the whole situation. (for ex. XYZ is not wearing a black pant. can easily be mistaken for XYZ wearing a pant if you miss out on the not.)Quantitative abilityThis is one of the more easier sections to get by, You just have to understand the concepts behind all the topics involved. Again the topics in this section are high school level math. You can over prepare for this section and most aspirants do.There are certain topics in this section that you would want to be extremely thorough with since they appear most frequently (going by the trends of past so many years), such as time speed distance, time work, Geometry, Functions.You would want to also be thorough with averages alligations, percentages ratios since these topics are more helpful in DI section but very rarely make an appearance as stand-alone questions in QA section.Number systems personally I felt for me was an extremely overrated topic ( I spent way more time than required here)PracticeTaking mock tests, I feel mock tests will be the most important part of your preparation as they help you guage exactly where you stand. (another benefit is to know which colleges you should apply to).What is a good number of mock tests to take? There isn’t any concensus on this topic, there are CAT toppers who got by on hardly any mock tests, and than there are people like me who took close 40 mock tests.Personally mock tests where the biggest source of practice for me. I took mock tests from 3 different sources. ( I recommend atleast 2 different sources). Once you have taken a mock test it’s extremely important that you analyse them well, I spent about an hour and half after every mock test to analyse where I have gone wrong and what can be changed. Mock tests are also a good time to test out strategies in handling various sections. (I will try to come with a detailed post about analysing mock tests.)I will boast a little here, but thanks to the trends on my mock tests I was extremely confident of getting the percentile I got on CAT. ( I expected at least a 99.5 %le)I recommend practicing during the time slot you will actually be answering the CAT, I had to take the CAT on a sunday in the morning slot (9.30 to 12.30) at a centre 30 kms away from home. Considering the reporting time of an extra hour, I would have to technically leave my house at 7 in the morning on the day of the test. I usually get hungry within 2 and half hours of eating anything. So in the month before CAT I trained my body, by having breakfast at 6 in the morning and not having anything till 1pm. I also trained myself to sit at one place for 4 hours (830 to 1230). This may seem funny/ unnecessary but on the day of the test you dont want to have any other factors troubling you.Taking the CATTry to stop preparation for CAT at least 3 days before CAT (there are people who will disagree and reccommend you remain in the mood and keep preparing) anything you try to “prepare” during these last days often will be of very little help. Don’t wander away from the CAT mood though, read or at least make sure you are sitting 3 hours at a place for these last few days ( to stay in the CAT mood).Do not take a mock test in the few days before CAT, If you mess the mock it is likely that you will panic on the day of the CAT.Do not keep any expectations as to the number of questions you want to complete in each section.All the best for your preparation for CAT.P.S. CAT isn’t everything, CAT is hardly a learning experience, you won’t learn anything new as such (well other than how to prepare hard) it’s mostly about things you already know, taking the CAT can hence be a very frustrating experience. I recommend that you learn something else too on the side lines, get a hobby or hold a job (again debatable as to how much time you can find etc.) If you are taking drop read a lot, read all the books you can get your hands on. All in all try to do something else too that will help you grow.Belling the CAT and other entrance exams","This answer is fairly long, about 7000 words. So I have divided my answer into 9 parts wherein each part can be read independently. However reading the entire answer in one go will serve as RC practice, so that would be advisable.What I have mentioned below helped me in my journey from 66% -> 99.85% in CAT. I have tried my level best to be as detailed as possible. GK as a section is not there in CAT as of now but is very important in the other papers like XAT, IIFT, SNAP, etc. So, I have included that as well. I have also put in a little bit about how to attempt mocks and then analyse them to improve further. A little bit on GD-PI-WAT as well, so that this answer serves all your needs.I would like to point out that I have been an average student all my life and am a GEM (General Engineer Male), yes pun intended. My 10/12/B.Tech scores are 83/79/66. With that I made it to IIM Calcutta, so the first thing that you should now do is stop worrying about your previous grades. 99% of the people reading this will surely have better grades. So, if I can you obviously can get through and study at an IIM.My CAT 2015 score card:QA: 99.8%LRDI: 99.96%VA: 87.33%OA: 99.85%This answer is divided into the following parts:A.) How to start?B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityC.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningD.) VA -> Verbal AbilityE.) GK -> General KnowledgeF.) How to attempt mocks? (Non-CAT exams at the end)G.) How to analyse mocks?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?I.) GD-PI-WAT prepA.) How to start CAT prep?Register at any site which lets you attempt and review a mock for free. You could try hitbullseye. If you have already enrolled for a test series or for a classroom programme, then attempt one of their mocks. Many of you would be like bhai abhi toh padhai start bhi nahi ki, mock deke kya hoga aur upar se aadhe questions toh samajh bhi nahi aayenge aur maths ke formula bhi yaad nahi hain. Additionally while attempting the mock, there will be multiple instances when you will feel like getting up because you are not used to solving questions for 3 hours at a stretch. Your brain will also try to deceive you into grabbing your smart phone for checking Whatsapp. You will feel like drinking water, you will also be tempted to check FB. The point of this test is to make sure that all this doesn’t happen when you actually attempt CAT. Now you would be thinking what is the point in attempting a mock when I don’t know $hi+.Precisely my point! The main reason for this mock was to identify what you know, what you don’t, where you stand and how much hard work is required.Once you are done with the mock, check the solutions and find the topics which you already know, which you attempted correctly. Some problems would have been there which you would have been sure of but you got them wrong because you were out of touch and forgot the formula or recalled an incorrect formula. You probably forgot the plural of fish. Fish or fishes? Or does it depend on whether I am talking about a species of fish or multiple units of the same species? Then you will realise that a little brush up of a few topics (which you are out of touch with) will dramatically improve your score. Work on these topics first and then move on to topics which you have no clue about. This mock decides your future course of study.Now, on to the preparation phase.B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityStart off with this site. http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/Click on start and then check your score. You know where you stand. Keep practising a few times every day and your score will keep improving. If you can hit 50-55 consistently in the default 120 seconds, you will easily hit 99.5% in CAT in this section. If you are targeting 99.5+ then I would also like you to memorise the following:B1.) Reciprocals, Squares and Cubes up till 30. Pay attention here, some values will get repeated. As for 1/7. Remember that it is .142857. For other go up to 2-3 decimals,whatever you are comfortable with. I would prefer 3 decimals though.B2.) Power of 2 up till 12Power of 3 up till 8Power of 4 up till 6Power of 5-6 up till 5Power of 7-10 up till 4Power of 11-13 up till 3Again same as above. Some values will be the same. 4^6 has already been covered till 2^12 and so on. Don’t just mug up blindly, pay attention to the numbers.B3.) Square Root up till 10B4.) Factorial up till 10B1-B4: Now most of you would be like, dude they give an inbuilt calculator. But then other exams don’t have that calculator. Additionally who do you think will take lesser time in solving a question? A person who uses the calculator for finding 12^3 or someone who just knows it is 1728. Believe me when I say that this is very important for your LRDI section as well. This will decide whether you get stuck at 99.5% or go beyond that. This is the deciding factor. Please memorise these values.B5.) A few important numbers like 999=27*37, 1001=7*11*13, 21^3=9261.B6.) Some numbers have the property wherein the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the no itself. 1, 2, 145 and 40585. Please remember these.B7.) There are 15 primes till 50, 25 till 100, 46 till 200 and 168 till 1000.B8.) How to find the sum of the first n natural nos. Sum of squares of n natural nos. Sum of cubes, sum of 4th powers. Please remember the formulas. Specially the last one (fourth power), most people forget that.B9.) Scale is not allowed in any of the exams. What the CAT authorities mean is that the scale which we used back in school that is not allowed. They never said anything about using your hand as a scale. Check the length of your fingers. Also check the length of the 3 sub division on your fingers. Use your right or left hand, whatever suits you. Please make sure that you remember these values by heart. These values will help you solve 90% of the geometry questions. Also, buy a protractor and make sure you can make the angles 30, 45, 60, 90 properly. First with the protractor and then without it. Based on the question, make a rough figure. Then based on your lengths, find the answer and then scale up to the value given in the question. Geometry has a lot of formulas, memorize them or use this approach. Approximation ftw!B.10.) Unitary Method. Make sure you are good with this, half the QA syllabus can be solved using unitary method. Do you think whatever has been mentioned in B9 is basically Unitary Method at the end for getting the answer?Most of the students go for solving the maximum no of problems. Don’t do that. Focus on the basics, don't go for solving questions directly like most students. Most students don’t score 99+. You are different, work differently. This is how you should be doing it for any given chapter day wise. First day go after the formulas and try to understand why a certain formula is there. Make sure that you have memorised all the formulas for that chapter. If you were to set the paper, what could be a possible question? Read a formula, try to frame questions on that formula and then memorize the formula. Just memorizing all formulas in one go won't help, because you will probably forget. If you can do this, then you would have solved all the questions by the time you finish reading the theory.Example: Let's say you are studying Numbers. You see the formulas for HCF and LCM of 2 nos. Then you see the factors of a number. Now think of possible questions on this. Let's say 72.1.) How many odd factors are there?2.) How many even factors are there?3.) What is the sum of the odd factors?4.) What is the sum of the even factors?5.) What is the product of the odd factors?6.) What is the product of the even factors?7.) How many factors are squares of natural numbers?8.) How many factors are cubes of natural numbers?Good going, you just completed half the chapter! Similarly think of more questions that you can make. The exercise at the end is filled with such questions. It depends on your thinking. Focus on this. If basics are fine,questions won't be a problem.Would you memorize 456*876 and 235*9865 and things like that or learn how multiplication works?If you think that you lack imagination when it comes to maths and can’t do the above, then no problem. As mentioned above, by the end of the first day you would be done with memorising all the formulas. That’s it. Don’t solve anything. Just make sure all the formulas are deeply rooted in your brain and you can recall them anytime you want. Now take a break for a day. On the 3rd day, start solving problems. But remember that you are to solve by recalling the formula not by turning over the pages and looking at the formula. If you cannot recall, then please make sure you memorize the formulas again. Solve a few problems. Take a day’s break and continue solving on the 5th and similarly on the 7th day as well. This way apart from the formula getting imprinted in your brain multiple times, you will also understand which formulas are asked more often than others. Some chapters are connected to one another. Make groups of such chapters. If working on a group, try to complete all the topics in that group. For example:Ratio Proportion, Unitary Method, Percentage, Profit and Loss.Simple equations, Simultaneous equations, Inequalities, Time speed distance and work, Quadratic.Progression.Numbers, Bases, Miscellaneous equations.Surds and Indices, Logarithms.Mensuration.Geometry.Coordinate Geometry.Probability and PnC.Functions and Graphs.For people trying to clear the cut off in this section. The first 3 with mensuration and a bit of geometry/numbers will be enough.C.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningData Interpretation is speed and practise. The site mentioned in the Quant region and B1-B4 there would be of immense help. These will increase your speed. Generally each and every DI set has at least a problem on percentage or ratio.Today when you start, start off with the sole intention of solving all the questions of a given set. When you can do that on a daily basis. Move to 2 sets a day. When you can do that. Move to 3 sets daily and then to 4 sets. Keep solving as many questions as you can. Time taken per question will decrease with practise. A few months after you were born, you started to crawl, then you started walking and finally you started running. Same thing here. Don’t think about speed now. Speed comes gradually. Let nature take its course.Logical Reasoning, as the name suggests is based on how well you can interpret and analyse things. LR checks your thought process, it checks how you tackle problems. Get this book ""Puzzles"" by George J. Summers. When you watch a football match, why do you watch it? Probably because you want your team to win or you want to see a good contest and enjoy. Similarly, once you have bought this book, think about your objective. It’s not about getting the correct solution, it’s about improving your thought process. And additionally the puzzles in this book are tough. You could think of it as the daddy of Irodov. Engineers will get the joke! You won’t be able to solve most of the problems and frankly speaking I don’t expect you to. However, what I do expect from you is to read a question. Try to understand what has been given. Try to understand what is being asked. Think about it for say 10-15 minutes. Write down whatever approach you can think of. If you could not solve it, look at the hints and their solution scheme. Were you thinking in the right direction?Analyse the difference between the method given in the book and your method.Try to understand what you missed because of which you could not solve the puzzle. Try again for 30 minutes. If you can solve it, good enough, if not maybe try again. After a few more tries look at the solution. Remember you bought the book to improve your thought process, not to solve each question in the first attempt. Trying a puzzle for 5 minutes and then looking at the solution will take you nowhere. Solving again and again till the time you get the answer is what the book was bought for. To make sure that you can think and get the answer on your own. The answer at the end is just for verification. 1-2 puzzles a day. 3 at max, not more than that. You have to improve your thought process,not complete the book as fast as possible. Your scores in the LR section will improve in a month’s time and then it will stay at 99%.Another very important point would be to memorize the alphabet-number conversion table. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. You will come across questions on this in your mocks as well as in the exams.D.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI had 69 and 72 in English in 10 and 12 respectively. My verbal score in CAT went up from 43 -> 87%. Whatever I have written below is what I did to make sure that I cleared the verbal cut off comfortably. If you are looking at a 99+verbal score, then you would be better off by reading the other answers to this question for improving your verbal section. This part is not for you kindly move on to the LRDI section. If you however $uck at English just like me, then this just might help you in clearing the sectional cut off. I tried memorizing words from the GRE word list. My language skills were not good enough to use words like persiflage, perspicuous, ubiquitous, scintillating, etc. in sentences. So, I would keep memorizing and then keep forgetting these words. I had never read novels so I had never come across such words as well. So, I came to the conclusion that memorising words won’t help me. But, a decent vocabulary is needed for CAT. So, I bought this book “Word Power Made Easy” by Normal Lewis. Managed to complete the chapters in a few months. I didn’t do the word list at the end. I would request you to buy this book and complete the chapters.Another thing that seemed obvious to me was that whether you look at RCs or Para Jumbles or Para Completion or Para Summary. All these have basically been written by some person who had a very good command over the English language. So all these things should logically have a flow of thought with which the author would have written the entire thing. You just have to understand that flow. If you can understand an RC, then understanding a paragraph from that RC will obviously be very easy for you. Think about it, a PJ or a PC or a PS are basically paragraphs taken from an RC. You just have to understand the flow in which the entire thing was written by some person who had a decent understanding of the English language. But, then I again had a problem. The Verbal section in CAT was supposed to be of 1 hour and as soon as I would start reading an RC, 8-10 minutes down the line I would feel drowsy. I would start thinking about checking FB or Whatsapp or practically doing anything apart from reading that stupid RC. All those Speed reading techniques, skimming, reading the question first and all. None of that mattered. I understood what my problem was. COMPREHENSION and CONCENTRATION. By the time I was in the 2nd para I would have forgotten what was written in the 1st para. It’s called a READING COMPREHENSION for a reason. Never trade comprehension for speed.How to improve comprehension and concentration?Both will improve gradually with time. First step is to make sure that you don’t feel drowsy when reading for an hour. You will be required to do that in the exam. So you need to build your stamina to concentrate. Start off by reading 2-3k word long articles on News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian. Register on the website and you will get a mail every morning at 10am. Read all the articles from there. Make sure you read at a stretch for an hour. Read everything from Culture to Technology to Art to Literature. In the beginning you will feel sleepy within a few minutes of starting. Slowly you will gain rhythm. Within 15 days you will be able to read 1 hour at a stretch. In a month’s time you will start retaining information as well. Then focus on just 1 category every day. Like only Philosophy or only Art or only culture. With that your stamina and concentration will increase further and since you are reading about only 1 thing for 1 hour, your knowledge in that topic will also increase. This can be done at home, but preferably in office to better utilize your time. PJ PC PS are all extensions of an RC. All will seem easy once you are comfortable with RCs. Here News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian you will be reading 2000-3000 word long articles. Once you are used to this, 500-600 word passages in CAT and other exams will be a piece of cake for you!For verbal, always eliminate choices and then mark rather than directly trying to find the correct answer. This section is different from the other sections,so it has to be dealt in a different manner. Please eliminate choices and then answer. If in doubt, leave. As for the grammar section, I have no idea when to use have and when to use has. Same with is/are and things like that. Neither can I spot grammatical errors in sentences. So, I mostly leave such questions.But I always read them. You can always answer a few of them based on instinct. Some sitters are always there in every paper.E.) GK -> General KnowledgeAll the papers except CAT have this section. Some have a sectional cut off,some don’t. This section can be answered in about 5 minutes. It has the highest marks/min for any section. This section is the key to a high percentile. This section will give you the points for speaking in a GD and PI and also for writing in WAT. So, if you plan on getting through to a good B-School don’t ignore it. There would be 2 methods to prepare for this.E1.) Start reading any newspaper. Go through the headlines and all. Make sure you are updated with what is happening in the country. After a week or so, you will realise that it’s mostly the same thing that keeps getting repeated everyday in the paper. Think of it from the point of view of the exam. There will be MCQs. So they won’t ask for your opinion on Kejriwal vs Modi. Leave all the pages on politics. That’s sheer wastage of time. Don’t waste time on that stuff! Make sure you remember the schemes which Mr Modi keeps rolling out. At least remember the important ones. Did any big firm buy another one? Any Indian who won some award abroad. Who won which Grand Slam? Who won the Pulitzer Prize? Who won the Arjuna Khel Ratna Award? India is working on the Chabahar port with which country? Malcom Turnbull is from which country? I think you would have understood what is expected from you. MBA is about business. Focus on economic and business news more than others. Noble Prize in economics fort his year? How many Deputy Governors are there in the Reserve Bank? Make a doc file with these details. You file would look somewhat like this.https://docs.google.com/document...This is what I had made for this year, so no this won’t help you! You will have to make one with the current affairs of this year. Since you will be working the entire year making this, so by the time the exams are a week away, you will have such a file. You might however think that this is too much work. In that case I would suggest you try the second and relatively easier method compared to this.E2.) Whichever is the first exam for you which will have a GK section, keep 4 days before that exam for making this file and memorizing it. Gather all the monthly booklets which are given to Time students. Each book has about 100 questions. Memorize the ones you think are important. CL and Time both will also have a few sheets on GK, current affairs, etc. Get those as well. CL GK compendium. Hitbullseye gk pdfs are also there. You can get most of these online for free or search on Pagalguy, someone would have uploaded it there for sure. Whatever you think is important, please memorize that. 4 days is more than enough to complete all the material I have mentioned above. By going through the monthly magazines you will also be able to keep track of what is happening in India and also round the globe.The regular reading (The first method, reading daily) means that when the exam sare about to start, you would have completed most of the things. The last 4 days will serve as a revision for you. I did both the above things. So if you have time go for it. A close friend of mine, Prateek, he was preparing for UPSC. He was of immense help! Whenever I would meet him, we would talk about how things going on in our country. Served as revision for him and I would stay updated with facts. So, if you can find someone who is preparing for UPSC religiously,i t would be great. You will also have a contact who is an IAS officer. If you want to score even higher in GK get a small yearbook from some shop. Small ones general contain 100 odd pages, going through that will serve as revision as well.F.) How to attempt mocks (Non-CAT exams at the end)The first step here is to make sure that you can sit and concentrate properly for 3 hours at a stretch. FB, Whatsapp, drowsiness, drinking water or the sudden urge to go to the washroom during these 3 hours have to be removed.Kindly take care of such things which might disturb you, especially the last 2 and then start a mock. When you are attempting the mock, the only thing in your mind should be about maximising your score! Another point that you should keep in mind in that no one cares about what you know and what you don’t. The only thing that matters is your score. So please keep your ego aside when attempting the paper. Yeh question kaise nahi bana, kal hi toh banaya tha and then you spend the next 15 mins on it and still end up marking the wrong answer. Please don’t! You have a fight with your girlfriend and then you are like “I am not texting her first”. Yes I was talking about that very ego of yours, please get rid of it when you are attempting a mock. If you can’t solve a question then please move on to the next one. The examination hall is not the place to derive a formula and then solve the concerned problem. Anyways, I could go on but I think I have made my point.Remember that half the paper is very easy, mostly formula based. Your approach should be to attempt these questions first. Make sure that you have touched the 97-98% mark and then move on to the difficult questions for improving your score.F1.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityYou are not supposed to start from question no 1 and then continue till 34. Most of the times you will not even be able to look at some of the problems in the end. So we will follow a Round by round approach. About 50% of the problems are direct formula based. When you start this section (Round 1), keep the above point in mind. So, as soon as you look at a question. Can you solve it in a minute by using a formula? If the question with a formula was given to a 5th grader, would he be able to solve it. If yes, then solve this question. Use the values given in the question, get the answer and then move on to the next question. If you see a question and you are like, yaar yeh toh banaya hua hai, 2-3 min lagega, lamba question hai. Or if you are like sirf cases likhne hain, phir count kar lunga, phir answer. Such questions which you know you can solve but are not direct formula based, are to be left out now. These have to be attempted in the 2nd round. Getting my point? If formula based, then attempt else next. Within 30 minutes you should have attempted about 16-17 questions and you would have seen all the questions. That will get you at least 97-98% in this section.Now Round 2, there were a few questions which you had seen earlier and were pretty confident about. This is where your brain will help you. The human mind is so awesome that even though you just looked at it once but solved different questions and totally forgot about it, you brain was working on that question subconsciously without you having any idea about it. Now, when you read the question, you will take a lesser amount of time to solve it compared to what you would have taken had you solved it in the first round itself. You could go for Round 3 as well, your choice! But 2 rounds are needed. Please stop with a single round method which most of you are used to now.Why this approach?Many people are most often not able to see the entire paper,so they miss sitters. This round by round technique helps you go through the entire paper and thereby select the easiest ones which in turn maximises your score. You won’t get a prize if you solve a question that only 10 students out of 2 lac could solve. The marks per question is the same. Since you solve the easier problems first, the chances of your committing mistakes goes down considerably. A question which you have solved but incorrectly is not wasted time and only a -1 for your score. Instead of 3 you get a -1. So such a question effectively hits you with lost time and a -4. This method reduces the no of such questions. Hence, this approach.F2.) DILR -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningIf you have tried solving the book which I had mentioned above, you would by now have a fair idea about how to make a table for solving LR problems. 5 people, 5 countries, 5 cars, 5 pets. All of us have solved such puzzles,haven’t we? You would obviously have 4 columns but which would be the first and which would be the second, etc. That determines how fast you will be able to solve the set. Oh, you thought it didn’t make a difference? It does! Sometimes you are better off soling set theory problems by a table. This is where your practise and experience comes into play. Making the proper table means half the work is done then and there. You just have to put in the values and tick mark the correct answers now.Now about how to attempt. When you start the section, go through the 4 LR sets.1-2 sets will be very easy. Take a couple of minutes and try to identify the easier ones. Look at the questions. Do you see any question wherein it asks how many cases are possible or questions of that sort? Such sets are to be solved at the end. Look for sets wherein directly by looking at the questions, you know that there is one unique solution. Use the answer options to further reduce your time for soling that set. Now start with such sets. First advantage of this method will be that you will feel good, because you will be done with a couple of sets in 10-12 minutes. Additionally you will be in a flow and your chances of cracking a difficult set will go up. Now compare this to the case when you start the section, and think that looking at all the questions means losing a few minutes. I am James Bond, so I will start with the first set. 10 minutes later you haven’t completed a single question and now for the remaining 50 minutes you will keep thinking, yaar 10 min faaltu mein barbaad ho gaye. Good luck solving that section and the next with such a mind-set.Many a time it will happen that the set you picked up, is going nowhere and yet time is passing on. For such sets, wherein you have already spent 4-5 minutes but haven’t been able to mark even a single question. Please leave that set.You might be tempted to think sirf 2 min aur, aur phir 4 questions ban jayenge. Please don’t commit that mistake. 5 minutes is the threshold in which you should have been able to mark at least 2 questions. Worst case scenario 1. If you are at 0. Please move on. You are better off solving that set later on,preferably at home!Same with DI sets, go through the sets, select the easier ones, and complete them. You will be left off with 2 sets. Again with 2 options, it always easy to select the easier one. This way most of the times, you will end up solving the toughest set at the end or you will probably leave it. All questions have the same marks, so isn’t it better to solve easier ones? Additionally tougher problems will also take a toll on your brain, your effectiveness for the next section might go down. Do you want that to happen?Sometimes a set will be easy but a question in there will be extremely tough.Beware of such questions, these are put in place to derail your momentum. 5-7 minutes per set is what you should be looking at. Always look at the questions and attempt. You don’t have to attempt all questions from a set. Even 3 attempts for a set is fine. Again, you know the term that I am talking about!Keep that aside when attempting a mock.F3.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI get tired of reading and lose interest quickly. So RCs at the end seems a bad idea. So, I start off with RCs. Again as soon as you start this section. Glance through all the RCs in a minute and check if any of them is from a subject you like. Your reading speed and comprehension will be higher in this case. Again as mentioned above, just because you read an RC, doesn’t mean you have to attempt all the questions. Even 4 out of 6 questions from an RC is good enough. Just attempting for the sake of increasing attempts is sheer stupidity. Please don’t think ki aree yaar itne marks toh already aa hi rahe hain exam mein. Dusron ko thoda mauka de deta hun -2 leke. Please don’t do that. Eliminate options and then attempt. When in doubt leave. Move on to the single questions after the RCs.Note -> For non-CAT mocks which you attempt online.First and foremost thing is that apart from CAT, most are pen paper based, but at home you attempt online papers for these. Take a few print outs of the OMR sheet and check how many minutes you need for marking the answers. Keep a 5 min buffer for your safety. Let’s say we talk about IIFT. It’s a 2 hour paper in real. However I need 20 minutes just for marking the bubbles. So, there is absolutely no point in attempting the online paper at home for 2 hrs. Submit the test after 100 minutes. Don’t worry if people attempt for 2 hours and your rank is low. Your score in the main exam matters, not in this one. Similarly for SNAP and XAT as well. Form a basic strategy of how you would like to attempt the paper for the 100 minutes(whatever your time is after you have checked marking in the OMR sheet). Like for Snap, I had a strategy of 5-6 minutes for gk then 16-18 minutes for verbal, then 35-40 minutes for LR. Then maths and as soon as it would be 90 minutes after the start, I would mark all the answers. Then solve and again mark in the last 5 minutes. Similarly make your strategy for IIFT, SNAP, XAT, etc. and stick to it.G.) How to analyse mock?The instant you submit a mock, you will have a score in mind, itna toh banta hai. 1 sec later the page reloads and you see your score and you go, are yaar itne toh 2 section milake hi aa jane chahiye the. This is why analysing the mock is important. You knew a certain score was achievable but your score went down drastically because of silly mistakes. Analysing mocks will take care of such mistakes. Once the solutions and result for a mock are out. First of all check up all the problems which you couldn’t solve. That’s what you have to learn.Then look at the time taken by the topper in solving a question. Look at your time. Did you take 200 seconds whereas the topper took 30 seconds? That’s because there is a technique you don’t about. Learn that technique. Write it in your notebook where you write formulas. That was about identifying and learning things which the toppers know. You have to be one of them. Go through the mocks and find such methods. AdditionallyThen there will be a category of questions you were sure of but you somehow used your talent and got it wrong and after looking at the solution you are like aree yaar yeh koi kaise galat kar sakta hai. But as a matter of fact, you did! This will happen mostly in counting problems (Numbers). Even if you had 100 in English in 10 and 12 you will still come to know that you had been using some Grammar rule incorrectly or there is some exception you had no clue about. But, after a -4 you will remember them! You will sometimes come to know that a certain word which you have been using all your life can also be used in a totally different context. Thank You without an exclamation mark? Sarcasm! Oxymoron, alliteration, etc. Learn what these mean. Such mistakes will make sure you remember all these. Sometimes you will take the diameter as the radius and solve. Sometimes 2*3 will become 5 and sometimes 7*19 will become 114. Don’t rush through problems. The paper is set so as to give you enough time. Slow and steady wins the race.Then another section in the results shows the % of people who attempted a question and % of people who got it right. You are supposed to attempt the easy ones first, then the average difficulty questions. Finally attempt a few difficult ones or totally leave them out. Here you can check which questions you were supposed to attempt but didn’t. Also the questions which you were supposed to leave but being the Bond that you are, you nonetheless decided to attempt it thereby losing marks and giving others a chance to overtake you. If your family is worth billions of dollars, you could do that, but given that you are still reading this, I doubt it! So whenever you look at such questions, try to think about what was in your mind during the mock which made you do such a thing. Try not to commit the same mistake again.Yes, I agree all this will take more than 3 hours. Who told you getting into a good B-school was easy?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?The study material from the top 3 institutes namely Time, CL and IMS is mostly the same. I have seen and used it, so use whichever you want, it won’t make a big difference. A few new ones like Hitbullseye and test funda are also coming up. Haven’t used the material by these 2 so can’t comment. In terms of content the level of questions is higher in Time. I mean tougher questions here, so you are better prepared for CAT, but then you could also argue about why put in more effort than required. In CL, the theory and explanations for quant is way better that that in others. Theory for quant is literally non-existent in Time. IMS is good for verbal. As mentioned above, please use that book for LR and also that book for Verbal. I have not mentioned the names of the books, because if you scroll up and check you will then remember the name when you have to tell it to the shopkeeper! That LR book will help make a strong base for you and then completing the LR material from these institutes will give you practise and improve your skills further. For those who keep talking about Arun Sharma, please please please use proper material. Do you really think 1 book is good enough for your CAT preparation and others are stupid who go through all that? If you think you are smart enough and don’t need all that and 1 book is enough. Good Luck with CAT!Mocks basically tell you where you stand when compared to the toppers in the country. Time has the most no of people attempting its Aimcats. So having that is a must. Next in line, with the maximum no of people attempting the mocks would be CL. After that you have IMS, test funda and all. Aimcats are pretty tough when compared to actual CAT but are extremely important because it gives you a true picture of where you stand and how much more effort you need to put in. CL mocks are close to the CAT level especially in terms of quant. IMS mocks are close to CAT level in verbal. I would suggest Time + CL/IMS. You can however take all the 3 if you want. Or maybe some other institute’s mock series. It’s mostly about practise.The mock questions are mostly the same. It’s just the values that they keep changing every year. Same with the material. Whether you look at the material of this year or that of 5 years ago, you will realise that it’s mostly the same. So, you are better off buying old material from someone or from a secondhand book store. I have uploaded some mocks and some prep material. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...https://drive.google.com/open?id...I also found some useful material from total gadha. Here’s the link for thathttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...I.) GD-PI-WAT prepFrankly speaking, getting a score is easy. This is the tougher part. This requires more hard work because in here, you will be up against the best in the country. Most of the people attending the interviews will come prepared, so here your odds will be higher. So, please work hard for this. GDPI prep as such should be dealt with in a different question. So, won’t go into the details here, but just an over view of what is expected of you. If you had done the GK and current affairs part as mentioned above, you will be easily able to manage the WAT. You will also have ample of points for speaking in a GD. Similarly questions on current affairs in a PI will also be a piece of cake for you. What remains is the HR part. In here, you have to understand that you can guide the interview and you can force them to ask exactly what you have prepared. But that requires a little thinking. Tell me about yourself is a standard question which is used to initiate an interview. It is mostly followed by your strengths and weaknesses. The main thing here is that you have to try to make a story and link everything that you have done in your life till now with why you want to do an MBA. The interviewers are smart people, they have been doing this for years. They are extremely good at catching liars. So think this through well. This part of your prep needs your utmost dedication and hard work. Prepare your answers properly. It is really tough to explain how to prepare for GD-PI. You will be better off at some institute where someone can guide you individually. However, what I can still do is upload all the GDPI material that I have and share it with you. But do keep one thing in mind, this contains some files on the current affairs of 2015, so that will be of no use for you. The other stuff is pretty much relevant. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...I hope you convert your dream college. May the force be with you!","How ‘NOT’ To prepare for CAT/GMATOne of the most important strategy in CAT/GMAT is to find out the wrong choices to identify the right one. This post is dedicated to “Avoiding Mistakes” strategy.Myth & Mistake-1: Following the Herd. Choosing a help or any coaching because others are choosing itHumans belongs to Animal kingdom. If you have studied Biology, then this point will be easier to understand. In animal kingdom. Weak animals are always in herd but the strong one is solitary or always having small groups. Ever wondered Why??The answer lies in the mentality. A strong animal judges the situation and leads its life based on its experience but a weak animal actions are based upon others. If others are doing it, then it’s wise to do it. You can choose to be a Herd follower or to make your own paths.Never follow the group. A leader never follows. If you will move with a group, you will always be with them. If you will create your paths, then only you can beat others. Adding following lines from Robert Frost to add a dramatic touch:“Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”Myth & Mistake-2: Focusing on absolute number of Successful Candidates rather than Percentage.Most of the Institutes talks about the number of success stories but are silent on how many of their students were unsuccessful. Even their Advertisements talks about total number of students getting Interview call or final admits. But the real numbers are shocking, most of the Institutes have 2-3 % students getting expected result.But the magic is in numbers. Make people follow a Herd and even if 2-3% students are successful, the success numbers become substantial. The problem is that your chances of landing in the unsuccessful students group is 98%, but this data does not bother them because they know how to work upon the “Herd Mentality” of the population. Show them 2% success stories and make them follow a herd.Myth & Mistake-3: The Bigger the Better.I am referring to Class Strength. No teacher can teach a herd. If your batch size is more than 10-12 students, then you are not getting proper attention from a teacher. If the education company is claiming “Customized or Personalized” services, then the class size must be less than 10-12 students.Myth & Mistake-4: Going after a Brand or No.1 education companyAll Branded books are easily available in the market at very low-cost. A student joins any help or coaching to get a personalized teaching experience. A Teacher-Student relation is analogous to a Mother-Child relation. There is nothing called “No. 1 Mother”. Every mother is No. 1 for her Kids and the reason is her personalized attention.Rather than sitting in a large group with “No. 1”, you should aim for a personalized attention (We join any help for their teachers or their course offering).Myth & Mistake-5: Deciding after taking DemosAll Institutes stage their Demos. They are very carefully planned. The teacher is usually the teacher, who will not teach regularly. If anyone says “Book your demo” or guide you to a specific time, then it is staged. The best way is to ask them about their class timings and insist on sitting in the ongoing class. If you feel the focus is on you, then you are at the wrong place.Try to identify honest institutes. Honesty should be a very important deciding factor.Myth & Mistake-6: Choosing Institute which makes “Toppers” or just focuses on “Past Records”Never choose any institute if its marketing is focused on this fundamental. Keep your basics simple. Think what you want from it and focus on its delivery. You are there for education, not to hear its past stories.Institutes focus on this factor to take your attention away from their product. Your focus should only be on their product, their teachers, their teaching methodologies, their course structures, etc.Myth & Mistake-7: Jo Dikhta hai, Wo (Nahi) Bikta haiA good product needs no marketing. Weak products need marketing. Whenever you see lots of marketing effort, Google ads, ATL or BTL, it proves that the product is weak. Strong product does not need for all these advertisements. In the marketing world, out of 4Ps, the product is supreme. Focus on “Product”.Myth & Mistake-8: Marketing Gimmick-CAT/GMAT Toppers as TeachersThis is the most commonly used marketing tool, which has a flawed assumption. Now I am talking more of “Critical Reasoning” language. The flawed assumption is “All Toppers are good Teachers”. Teaching needs a very different skill set. The teaching is to impart knowledge; all toppers cannot be good teachers and all good teachers cannot be toppers.Myth & Mistake-9: Institutes offering Patented Techniques or “Tips & Tricks”All tests require “Hard Work”. If someone can patent “Hard-work”, then this “Gimmick” should be accepted. “Tips & Tricks” are developed with your hard-work. Shortcuts should be evolved and should never be learnt from someone else. Particularly for CAT/GMAT, which is more of an IQ test, “Techniques, Tips & Tricks” should be evolved.Myth & Mistake-10: CAT/GMAT will take me to HarvardThis point is more applicable to business schools taking GMAT as a screening tool.The student’s full profile will work. The CAT/GMAT is a one small part of the profile. Look at all business schools as a family, no family will allow you to be their part till the time they see their values or virtues in you. Every Business school has a distinct positioning and your profile should be positioned in the same way. Profile building is the main work and every person should concentrate on.Myth & Mistake-11: Adopting Toppers StrategiesHear everyone, but adopt none. Every person develops his own ways depending upon his Strengths & Weaknesses or as per his conditions. Good for someone may not be good for you. Hear everyone, but adopt only wisely.Myth & Mistake-12: Practice-More the merrierPractice Better, Not More. The practice should have a direction, running in circles will not help. Do Tests and review. Keep error Logs and keep on practicing. Practice wisely, so that every time you move, you should learn from your past mistakes. Do not overdo the tests.Myth & Mistake-13: Teachers will make me a TopperTeachers show us directions. Unless you practice the topics taught in the class, it will not work. I saw many students thinking that if they spend more time in classes, it will help.Myth & Mistake-14: All tests just needs lot of studying, no need to focus on healthHealthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. I see many students not focusing on their health during exams. Many of the studious people have unhealthy bodies. You need to balance life with at least 7-8 hours’ sleep.Myth & Mistake-15: I do not need any peer groupYou learn more from peers than the teachers. The most important factor will be jealousy. Competition in the group brings the best out of you. I was very fortunate that all others in my group were good. They have already scored more than 700 in prep tests. Every test was like a world war where every one of us wanted to beat everyone else in the group.Myth & Mistake-16: I will study and practice from lot of free materials on netBeware of free materials. There is no free lunch. Some free materials are good, but most of it is crap. The real test is different from the Free tests you see on the net. You will be caught off-guard if you are preparing from the net material.Myth & Mistake-17: Beware from 30-day toppers, 15-day toppersThis is the most common way of advertisement. Become a topper in 30 days or 15 days. It’s hilarious. This is a perfect example of fraud marketing. The CAT/GMAT is an IQ test. Only Asterix magic potion can do it and nothing else.Myth & Mistake-18: You can deceive GMAT Computer Adaptive AlgorithmPlease do not try. GMAC has evolved a test which cannot be deceived. Every question can carry you “Up” and throw you “Down”. Each question is important and has the same value as others do.One more myth is when a student believes that difficult questions carry more marks. And easy questions weightage is low. Do not read too much into any strategy. Work hard and it will show.One more mistake is trying to gauge your performance by counting correct questions out of total. This is the reason why the GMAC computer algorithm is difficult to copy.If you see easy questions, you are not doomed. It does not necessarily mean that your test is not going well.Myth & Mistake-19: Quantitative is important, Engineers have an advantageEngineers do not have any advantage in this test. Rather, they are at a disadvantage because their strength (Quant.) does not have substantial weightage. I have seen many students crossing 700 with 40 in quant and Q40 can be achieved by more than 80% of the test givers.Myth & Mistake-20: I am good in English, verbal will be kids playVerbal is not English, verbal is all about IQ. The only portion of the grammar it touches is SC. But the way CAT/GMAT tests your grammar is more based on IQ rather than grammar rules. SC is more about identifying the wrong choices rather than the correct one. It depends upon how easily you can see 2-3 splits and apply logic to find the correct answer.In CAT/GMAT, there is no perfect answer, you must mark the “Most” correct answer. There might not be any perfect answer in the five choices.Your choices should be based on your experience and how a help will help you cover your shortcomings. I found EduShastra customized approach much better than others.

CAT,What are the strategies to get 99+ in CAT?,https://www.quora.com//What-are-the-strategies-to-get-99+-in-CAT,Common Admission Test (CAT),13,"Thanks for the A2A.I have written an answer at Rajat Jain's answer to How has Rajat Jain prepared for the CAT 2015?I will copy past the same stuff.I will explain in detail how I prepared for CAT. but before beginning, these were my sectional percentiles: -VA/RC = 97.07DI/LR = 99.99QA = 99.98XAT = 99.834I appeared for CAT in my final year of undergraduation from IIT Delhi in Civil Engineering.I joined TIME institute CP in January 2015 for CAT. After the initial enthusiasm settled (as soon as Jan ends), I attended only those topics' classes in which I was weak or required brushing up. For me that meant leaving most of the quant classes.Identifying weak spotsThe very step to any preparation is to analyze your strong and weak areas. If you are good in Time, speed and distance, unitary method but weak in Probability, then you know where to focus your attention.If you are inherently weak in a section (like me in VA), then again identify the most crucial question category and focus on them. Practice them everyday. Make sure it comes naturally to you just like any other strong area. (RC is the most imp. topic as per my experience with CAT2015).Also, see that you are preparing the right stuff, you don't need to do grammar for VA as it had not come this year and unlikely to come in 2016. If there is any change, you will know in October, and will have sufficient time to prepare for Grammar or any other section then.That said a good grammar definitely adds to your Essay writing skills required for XAT or during WAT at IIM interviews.DI/LR StrategyStudy Material: - TIME Modules for DI and LR. Worksheets given by TIME in class. The level of questions is really good in the advanced problems workbooks and class worksheets given in workshops.Solve all the questions in a chapter after reading and learning the theory very well. If you are not familiar with the theory, then it's not alright to begin questions. Learn all the concepts, shortcuts etc.Mark the questions you find genuinely difficult or those which require thinking not usual to other questions in the chapter.Don't solve more than 1 chapter in a day. This is the time required to absorb all the concepts. In fact, each chapter requires 2-3 days for complete absorption.Wait for a week and solve the marked questions only again. If you are not able to do them, then read the theory again and practice the worksheet again. Else, move onto next chapter.CAT 2015 had a really tough section of DI/LR and preparing for all kind of questions did prove to be helpful.QA StrategyStudy Material: - QA for CAT by Arun Sharma in general. For number theory I did refer to Total Gadha notes. They were really good. For Permutations & Combinations, Geometry, Probability, Functions, I referred to my notes from IIT-JEE modules. Even though the level was tough as opposed to CAT level, but that develops thinking ability and gives you an edge against competition.The strategy is same as that of DI/LR strategy.**Imp** As the CAT introduces subjective questions, it becomes all the more imperative to solve questions to the very ending and not leave in between just getting the idea to solve. Please solve each question by hand till the end. I don't think that I need to stress the importance of practice.VA StrategyStudy Material: - TIME modules for RC and Arun Sharma for RC. I didn't study any grammar, flash cards and parajumbles. (Maybe that explains 97.07). But on seeing the CAT sample paper uploaded in October, I was sure that even if I crack RC, I will easily manage a 90+ in the section.Just practice the worksheets and book. I will really advice to purchase Arun Sharma as it explains in a detailed manner how to approach RC passages and solve them. Helped me a lot as I was beginning the prep.Importance of SectionsIMHO, there is nothing like a very important topic or the least important topic in QA, every year they focus on some or the other area. For CAT 2015 it was Geometry. It can be numbers for 2016 or anything else. Prepare each topic very well.VA has RC as the most important topic (24/34 questions, all objective, all easy/medium difficulty).For DI/LR, I failed to identify what's important, and that worked best for me, as I was aware of almost all the concepts which appeared in the exam. Thus, again, no important topic as such. But you can safely leave Data sufficiency, cubes, number series problems. CAT will focus on paragraph based long questions (as has been trend for past few years).Test Taking StrategyStep 1: - Spend 2 minutes (neither more nor less) glancing at the questions in the section all at once.Step 2: - Start with the easiest first (solve all easy questions) there are usually 8-10 easy questions. (you should solve them in 15-20 mins).Step 3: - Move to the most difficult/difficult question according to you. Solve, 3-4 difficult questions. Please make sure you don't evaporate all the time on those questions, just attempt them, if you don't get at anything within 1-1.5 minutes leave that question. Move to other difficult question, repeat. Here also, don't attempt difficult questions from topic you have left completely, even though I will advice you to not leave any topic. There are no more than 4-5 difficult questions in a section. (This shall consume at most 12-13 minutes).Step 4: - Now move to all other questions, select the question which topic is your strongest. And pursue in descending order of your strength in the topic. You shouldn't follow this strategy from the beginning because there might be easy questions from topics you don't have a very good command over, but you will be able to solve them if you attempt them. Don't lose those free marks.This strategy works best for Quant.For DI/LR, just see the questions and the passages' overall difficulty. If all questions are difficult but interrelated, then it is worth to give that a shot as an invest of 12 - 15 minutes means 4 questions solved straightaway.How to analyze the mocks?To appear for Mocks every week is the biggest blunder you can commit in the initial stages of your preparation. Take mocks every 15 days. When there are just 2 months left, take them every week and monitor your progress.Step 1: - Take your mocks really serious. The three hour sittings should be just like they will be in CAT. No break, only water in between, as and when required. Rough sheets, one pen, full concentration and utter silence in the room. Personally, I feel the mocks on centre are more stimulating than the ones taken at home as they give you a real feel.Step 2: - Once the results are out, you need to analyze how you fared in each section as opposed to how others performed. Here, please don't measure per question performance for yourself and for others. Sometimes, some topic might be strong for you or you might have spent more time on a question, or simply a question easy for you might have been average overall. Just get the general idea of your percentile/rank in the section.Step 3: - Open detailed solutions, see which particular questions you did wrong and why?, remember ""NO MISTAKES ARE SILLY"". Unless you didn't know the concept at all, the chances are that you didn't practice enough. All those 'silly mistakes', require practice extensively. Spend time on those topics even if you had prepared them very well in the first instance.Step 4: - Even if after identifying your problem areas/silly questions and practicing the topics thoroughly (chances are you will identify the problem as you practice this time), from beginning to end, you are still unable to score in that topic in the next mocks, meet your teacher with specific doubts and take their input on how to solve those questions which you were unable to solve.To read my advice on joining the best test series, click here. Rajat Jain's answer to Which is the best test series for CAT?Some more Tips.How much time to devote: - There is no right answer. Just ensure 3-4 hours on weekdays and 6-7 on weekends dedicated preparation for at least 4 months. Rest depends a lot on your previous level.Maintain a Diary: - I think this is the most important thing I did. Track you topic wise progress in each of the three sections. From planning your next day to planing the week (don't go beyond that), it should cover your progress and your goals. Just writing your goals will help you focus more on them.The topics to be covered, and how much to be covered (like upto 3 worksheets), topics which need revision, topics where you didn't do well in Mocks. This helps a lot in planning your way to cracking the CAT.Speed vs Accuracy: - This is again an issue faced by a lot of aspirants but it's actually simple. If you don't understand the question even after reading twice, leave it. Move ahead. That will ensure speed.Accuracy is developed by practicing and analyzing mocks to identify weak spots and then practicing more. Don't give excuses like ""I got nervous"", ""I panicked"" Or ""I would have done it had I been given 5 more minutes"". They won't help.5 word rule: - Once you come across a word, search its meaning on phone and bookmark it, learn 5 new words daily. I am sure you will come across 5 new words daily. If you come across more, no problem choose 5 in alphabetical order. Also, you can just open the app where you bookmarked your words and revise them when you are travelling or during interstices (gap b/w activities).Working the interstices: - There is a lot of time between various activities which go waste. You can utilize them by working towards you CAT preparation. Here, technology comes to your rescue, reading newsstand, learning word meanings, solving sudokus, magoosh english apps etc are some ways you can utilize the time you have between various activities like travelling from home to work/college/coaching; a free period; an hour with nothing to do; just pull your phone and read/solve.Scheduling: - Plan your next day before ending going to bed. The topics you will be studying next day and for how long. Set the goals and stick to them. This is imperative as this helps you make the most out of the day.Vocabulary: - Build a strong vocabulary. This comes in handy during RC passages in CAT. The best way to do that is to learn frequent words as provided in various books for CAT preparation. For eg. Arun Sharma has high/medium/low frequency words. Learn all the high frequency ones at least, most of the medium frequency and leave the low frequency words (unless you have a lot of time and nothing else to prepare).Also, read The Hindu editorials (hard copy reading, their app doesn't have full articles), Quartz, Scroll, The Economist articles and The Indian Express editorials. (Best way is to read is to subscribe all the channels on Play Newsstand, and download scroll app).Find your motivationI decided to go in business field and leave engineering behind in my third year. My motivation to enter business field was so strong that even during the placements I only applied for management related roles (and eventually got one). The desire to go in the business field was the motivation to clear CAT with a good percentile. Find the motivation to keep you going through the prep phase. It can be money, ego, bragging, brand value or work profile. Whatever it is, just make sure you are motivated to prepare for CAT, else each day will be a burden and you won't be able to enjoy the preparation.Solve Sudoku/Kakuro daily. I personally solve more than 5 sudokus everyday. I will recommend this as the best website Billions of Free Sudoku Puzzles to Play Online or through their app on playstore for phones but any app will work fine. Solve hard puzzles or increase your level slowly and try top be in top 5-7% of solvers. Don't use pencil or checks or guess work, only logic.Sidenote: - CAT is an examination which checks your temper and aptitude. So, someone who has prepared for a week and appeared for the examination and manages to keep his calm for the next 3 hours of examination will be able to score better than someone who flusters as soon as he is not able to solve 2-3 questions.","It would depend on 3 parametersYour inherent capabilityTime and effort you are willing to spendExamination patternGetting a good score in CAT requires the followingGood hold on English, Maths and Logic - this is broad, for CAT focuses on several aspectsProblem solving speed WITH accuracyStaminaDepending on where you stand, you can improve all this with practice.Now, you mustFirst analyze the 3 parameters I have listed aboveSee where you stand. What you are good at, what you are not. Map it to the examination pattern (which would come in later, so take a cue from previous years). After that, assess how much time and effort you can put - try to bring that out in numbers. How many hours a week? How many questions before you burn out?Once that is done,Build you knowledge base to improve your hold on contentMy personal recommendation would be to use books and material from TIME. See the areas you are weak in, and focus on them. Go through Theory and simple practice questions. The aim is to become EVEN IN ALL SPHERES. Then,Become proficient at solvingStart solving questions. You can start with booklets and/or TIME’s online mini tests. Here, since this is practice and there are A LOT of questions, I would say you spend less time on actually solving and more time on GOING THROUGH SOLUTIONS. EVEN for the ones you were able to solve. This will allow you to have a mental map of best solutions to most problems. Then,Improve time and accuracyNow, start timing yourself. Again, use the booklets and/or TIME’s mini tests. Make sure you measure BOTH time and accuracy. The previous two steps have given you a base of knowledge AND solutions. It is now time to improve your application. Here, spend more time and effort on solving BUT still, go through the solutions in detail. In parallel,Start competingAfter all, it’s a relative score. Keep a measure of where you stand in all the All India Tests you can lay your hands on - TIME, IMS, CL, whatever.Build staminaCAT is a 2/3 hour exam where you have to be at your peak for that time. Towards the end, I would practice for 4–5 hours at a stretch once a week - mostly with two back to back full tests. Something I picked up from the legend about Barcelona players practicing for 180 minutes. This way, 2 hours seemed like a piece of cake for me and I never tired myself during the test.After all this, you still will have areas of strengths and weaknesses. By now, you know your overall standing. See if you are consistently making some errors - particular questions, time management, accuracy. Repeat step 2 with this in focus.I followed this approach and it worked for me. Here’s my anecdoteIn my first CAT, I scored 99.97 in VA and 91.something in Quant. 99.87 overall. Could not attempt 30% of the paper due to lack of time. So I went on a question solving spree in Quant. Once I was at a sufficiently even level, started going through solutions. This significantly improved my time. Then I went for tests and accuracy. Finally, started giving the AIMCATs and analyzed where I was scoring less and where others were scoring more. I was consistently in the top 5, yet there were areas people below 50 were scoring more than I was. So there was room for improvement. Finally, my CAT score was 100, with 100 in VA and 99.99 in Quant. I had attempted 99/100 questions and had 25 minutes left at the end to rack my brains on the 1 question I could not solve. I still could not solve it, but at least I got to review my other answers twice/thrice.Hope this helps :)NOTE: Can update with some stuff on giving the CAT exam itself, if required.","I scored an overall score of 97.2 percentile with 99.09 percentile in quants and 96-97 (don't remember exact) percentile in DI (yes verbal was my weak point). I can share the strategies I used to prepare for the exam -Read material - Read basics of the three from whatever reading material you are following like R.S.Aggarwal etc. or even if you have joined some coaching like TIME, Career Launcher, etc. then also it would be fine. Most the things you will read here, you would already be knowing but it would be mostly some brush ups and may be you would learn a couple of new tricks.Give mock exam - When I say give mock exams I do not mean that you are practicing some problems from a section in your room. What I mean is that you keep yourself in examination condition and try solving the mock papers in that particular amount of time. I would recommend you to join some test series like AIMCAT of TIME, etc.Analyse and make your strategy (MOST IMPORTANT) - Now, most of the students preparing will do the first and second point I mentioned but they will miss this point. A test series generally has about 20 tests (including proctored and non-proctored). I analysed my test and made my strategy in the following manner -In about the first 5 tests I tried various combinations of the order in which I would have to give the exam like DI, Quant, Verb ; Quant, Verb, DI; and so on. I tried to understand which combination worked for me the best and tried adopting that. I used Quant, Verb, DI. It varies from person to person but a general rule you could follow is keep the your strongest part the first and the weakest the second (reason for this is out of the scope of this question).Once you gave the exam see the solution provided for the answer. See the solution even if you did that question correctly as there might be a better and shorter method of doing that question. I can tell you that most of the people do not follow this point but if you follow it then I can from my experience that it works like a charm.Time your test and see how much time do you give to a particular section. Once you know that a particular section takes this much amount of time then you manage your time in a way like suppose you take 50 min in Quants then allocate it like (40+10) min. 40 min can given the first time you are doing the question and keep 10 min that you can come to that section again. You can get the best out of those 10 mins if you have wisely used your 40 min and marked the question you were not able to solve at that point but probably you can solve if you visit again and spend a bit more time on that question.In last I would conclude by saying that no one can tell the best strategy for you but you yourself can find it. Its just a matter of hard work, perseverance and dedication. All the best for your exam !!!","Preparation StrategyThere are no hard and fast rules that one can crack CAT if they start preparation very early. Some of them with just 2 months of rigorous preparation have been able to pull it off. Yes indeed. If you start early, you will have lots of time and can prepare with ease. If not, then it could be pretty strenuous but still you can pull it off provided that you have the sheer determination to do it so.Focus on the Basics/Fundamentals.Then increase the pace and also the level of your preparation.I have explained some simple strategies which you can effectively follow;Simple strategies but could prove to be very effective:Please follow 20 mins strategy. Prepare seriously for 20 mins and then give a small break. Break depends as you can take a 1 min break to an hour. It solely boils down to you. With this strategy, even if you prepare for 10 times a day (10 x 20 mins = 200 mins = 3hrs 20 mins); then you would be able to put in 3hrs and 20 mins of valuable effort. More importantly, you will not have any starting problem as some students struggle to even start.Further, keep yourself fit by doing meditation, yoga and exercises like walking, running etc to keep yourself fit. Staying fit helps you in enhancing the body & mind and in turn helps in increasing the concentration level.Have a clear goal for your preparation. Work everyday with a plan. Systematic and consistent preparation helps you a lot. More importantly, learn it with passion. If you learn with passion, then you can enjoy studying and not creating self inflicted unwanted stress.Clear Plan and GoalI come across students at times who say that they want to do this and that and so on. Have a clear plan, stick onto your goal and learn with passion. You can then achieve what you want.Self Study or Joining Online/Classroom CoachingOne always has an option to go in for self study. But that requires a high level of self motivation, sheer hard work and lots of time to understand the concepts.In turn, if you join coaching institute, it really helps you as you get to learn from the expert faculty in respective areas and it helps you to save a lot of time, as understanding concepts can take time. Further, you tend to learn tips, strategies and short cuts from the faculties.Further for preparation, student can choose online coaching. But then, the rigor of online and classroom coaching definitely differs. Coaching institutes play an important role in imparting strategies and giving a systematic structure to the student.Other than this, student should be sincere to classes and must put the best effort as their is no substitute for hard work.Factors to be Considered for Classroom CoachingIf someone has to choose coaching institute, then the factors to be considered are1) Faculty profiles (that also include qualifications) [In my opinion, that's one of the most important factor],2) Small class size i.e Faculty : Student Ratio (Even this is a very important factor) [It is still fine if the class size is slightly large provided that very good faculties handle the class]3) Materials,4) Online Test Series (Since most of the exams are online),5) Training for Written Ability Test & Personal Interview,6) Post Counselling [To help students to choose the best of the B-Schools]Online test series, training for interviews, post counselling etc will be missing if you were to prepare on your own. It’s not how early you start or you prepare in a rush with few months to go, the most important thing is that you enjoy the journey & learn it with passion and work hard with clear goal of getting into the top B-Schools no matter what.Take Mock TestsFurther, take lots of Mock Tests (after your preparation) and do a lot of self analysis after each and every test. Through this, you would be able to analyze your strengths and weakness. More importantly, you will not repeat the same mistakes again.TargetTry to score a minimum of 95+ percentile in each and every section in CAT Exam to get calls from any of new IIMs. However, it is advisable to score 98+ percentile and above in each section to get calls from IIM-A,B,C. Kindly note that the CAT Scores is only one of the criteria used for the selection process and even with a very high percentile; there are no hard and fast rule that for sure you will get calls from old IIMs. My suggestion is that you try to score the maximum in the CAT exam rather than worrying much about the cut-offs. Still with a very high score, there is no guarantee that you will get selected.The reasons could be as mentioned below,Academics, Previous Work Experience, Diversity, Extra-curricular and your past performance. Please note that the selection is based on ’n’ number of factors and not the scores alone.Strong in Academics (Getting very high CAT percentile) but weak in personality development like lack of good effective communication skills (Includes Writing + Speaking Skills) might lead to student not doing well at all in WAT and PI.Each and every IIMs are autonomous institutions. They have their own criteria to select. So no one can question them when it comes to their credibility during the selection process.Overconfidence. Don’t be overconfident if you get 99 percentile in CAT. Please don’t forget that you have WAT and PI. Prepare well and give your best.Be careful at the time of personal interviews. Kindly respect and be very humble with the interviewers (IIM Professors). Don’t act way too smart and No Heropanti Please.Over smart. There might be many others like you who get selected. Even if they got 95 or say 97 percentile, they might run over you at the time of WAT and PI.Finally, the committee must feel convinced that you are the right selection for their prestigious institution and if they feel that you are not, then you are out.NOTE: SIGN Consulting has created a mark in the field of CAT Coaching because of it’s rigor and for the individual attention given to each & every student.

CAT,How do I get a 90 percentile in the CAT if I'm currently scoring between the 50s in mocks?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-get-a-90-percentile-in-the-CAT-if-Im-currently-scoring-between-the-50s-in-mocks,"Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",8,"Hey bro, I won’t sugar coat and say. If your mocks are in 50s, you can increase it to around 80–85 maximum after more preparations(in mocks). The actual CAT is going to be tough. No shit. You and I will score less than the mocks in CAT. Try for 85 percentile or so. In the last 10 days you will be stressed like hell and will lose concentration often. Everyone will say you can get 90 percentile easy. Trust me bro the people who say these are people who are either scoring very well or just giving free advice.I scored 85 percentile last time after getting around 90–93 constant in mocks. I didn’t get any good b school.Anyway you paid the fees to write the exam. Go for it. Do what you were doing till now. And in the mean time, apply for TISS. It’s actually much easier than CAT, except the GK section. That you have to take care in 1 month. If you can score around 85 in CAT, you can score good in TISS.But i say it again. Write CAT like its life and death(basically it is life and death to an extend). If not, write CAT next year. This year isn’t the end of the world. So if you score good, you join a good place, else go for TISS, worst case, write CAT next year. No harm done.","Hii. Although I am not in any position to guarantee you something, but there are some important points that I need to share with you that enabled me to look past my mock scores and perform well in Cat 2017.According to me, leaving a question that you could do easily in the exam is a crime, but leaving a easy question for a tough question just because the tough question was asked before the easy one is a crime with equal sentence as one when you do a question wrong.You need to ask yourself if you are that dim a person to score so low in the mocks? And then you need to tell yourself that you know more than the person who scores 80+ percentile in the mocks, the only difference being in his application.So the next you give a mock or the real exam, you must answer the easiest questions first, what stands against this theory is human tendency to solve the questions they can, which contributes to their downfall. Because there is a time and order to solve each question, there are questions in the exam which you can solve but are better left unattempted.Read the question and ask yourself if the question in front of you is a question to be attempted just now, and if you get the answer in positive, then only attempt the question.There is one more problem here, that there must be loopholes in your preparations too. Otherwise you might have got good scores in some of your mocks.So you need to do the following.Revise your maths concepts as quickly as you can, also , practice variety of questions. You can watch my videos on Unacademy too, I have many courses of maths, with every course of 1–2 hours. Here is the link to my profile https://unacademy.com/user/s2274...View different types of sets of DI and LR. Also , remember that you need only 1–2 sets in the exam to score decently considering the level of exam asked , you might feel the heat while skipping questions in the section, but I'll suggest you to wait for those 1–2 easy sets.Practice English comprehension more. Verbal ability questions are usually difficult. Try to maximize your score in english too by improving your accuracy.In the end believing that you'll score and do well in the exam is the most important factor to succeed in the exam, if you will not believe that you can score 90+ percentile, there are no chances you are getting there.Good luck.Link to one of my coursehttps://unacademy.com/lesson/roo...","Thanks for A2A, Priya Agarwal and Rohith SharmaTo score 90 percentile you need to score around 40%~120 marks. With your current score of 50, you need to improve your score by 140%. You need to increase your knowledge base as well as the exam strategy.Knowledge buildingYou need to identify, your source of additional 70 marks. Since you cannot study a lot of topics in the last 12 days. Following is the list of the topics which can push your scores on the higher side:Reading Comprehension: 24 questions= 72 marks. This is the most important topic.Write a central idea for each paragraph. It helps in solving all main point/summary based questions.List down all the question types and your approach to solve such questions.You can study to build a full proof approach for Reading Comprehension Amazon.in: Rahul Anand, Kamlesh Chauhan: BooksArithmetic and Algebra: 12–15 questions +6–8 questions=54–69 marks. The most important module in quantitative aptitude (QA).Solve all previous year questions. This is good enough to understand the types of questions asked from these topics.Exam StrategyYou need to follow different exam strategies for each of the sections. Follow the following flow charts as a reference to make your own effective exam strategies:Verbal abilityData Interpretation and Logical ReasoningQuantitative AptitudeIf you are in New Delhi then you can attend Bfactory Last Mile Workshop at BFactory DelhiAll the bestKamlesh Chauhan","Analyze your mock results and try to decipher your strong areas. There are many types of questions in VARC section. Check which questions are most easy for you to solve. These questions would be the ones which you always get right. Then look for questions which are your average area. These questions would be the ones which sometimes you are able to solve and sometimes you are not. Then finally your weak areas. These questions you were never able to solve.After making a list of all the types of questions, you should always first attempt your strong-area questions and then average ones if you are a little bit sure about the answers and lastly, try to avoid weak-area questions because they are the cause of your negative marking and hence lower scores.At the same time, you can start focusing on your average area type questions more. Practice these questions more so that you can turn them into your strong area. This much should be sufficient for your CAT preparation.Good Luck!!!"
CAT,How can I prepare for CAT 2017?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-prepare-for-CAT-2017-1,"CAT Preparation 2017, CAT (Common Admission Test) 2017, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",100+,"""Many great things can be done in a day IF you don’t always make that day tomorrow""A common question troubling MBA aspirants is when to commence with CAT preparation and the answer is NOWAs mentioned by many, CAT (Common Admission Test) is one of the toughest exam to crack. It is the gateway to getting into prestigious IIMs and other top B-schools of India. So the very first thing that you should do is:Understand the syllabusThis is a useful tip for almost any exam. Understand the syllabus by going through past year’s papers and official guidelines. All the information about CAT/XAT/NMAT/TISS/MICA/SNAP/CMAT/CET are available on our website www.catking.in .CAT can be segmented into four broad parts-Quantitative AbilityData InterpretationLogical ReasoningVerbal AbilityStart your preparation with sheer determination.Know where you standA lot of successful IIM aspirants attribute their success to the efforts put in the last 4-6 months before the CAT. Take the Basic Mock test at Catking to know where you stand. This can then be used as a base to start your preparation for this year.Should you join coaching?This is based on a lot of things. If you have a lot of time, you can go for coaching. However, if you are into a hectic job and get very little time to study, you can prepare on your own or you can join online classes. Although Coaching will give you proper guidance on what to prepare, major areas to focus on, strategies to save time and also help in preparing for Group Discussions and Personal Interview. Catking is one of the best Cat classes in Mumbai and Pune. You can register yourself here www.catking.in for free demo lecture.Books and materialFirst of all, get CAT preparation material of some good coaching institute. You can buy Catking books which are apt and more than sufficient for CAT preparation.For verbal, you also need to read “Word Power made Easy” by Norman Lewis. It is a very good book which helps in increasing vocabulary not by memorising stuff, but by understanding the ideas behind the words. It is distributed into 45-47 sessions meant to be read one at a time. It is a must-read book and should be completed within two months of starting your preparation.Test SeriesThis is like the Holy Grail of CAT preparation. Subscribe to one good Test Series and write all the tests very sincerely in simulated environment. Fix a day, say Sunday, fix a time, say 9 AM, and give the test every week at the same time. Sit in proper position while attempting the test and tell all your roommates or family members not to disturb you at that time.Once you write 15-20 such tests, CAT will no longer be a stranger to you. When you will sit for actual CAT, you will feel as if you have done this a lot of times and it will help you to remain confident during the exam. You can buy Catking Mock Series consist of Basic and Advance level CAT questions.To improve in the Verbal section your need to have a grasp on the following:1. Reading and comprehending ability: Comprehension is more important than speed of reading2. Reasoning Skills: Improve your critical reasoning skills. This will not only help your solve the verbal reasoning questions but also the Reading Comprehensions questions3. Grammar and usageReading is important but your ability to Summarize correctly after you read an article/passage is also very vital. Work on this ability and I am sure you will be able to improve your CAT scores in this section.(Remember understanding a passage correctly is more important than reading it faster). Catking has come up with an excellent Verbal Maximizer Course which consist of 500 questions covering entire verbal syllabus with recorded solutions along with 50 Test sets.Ability in Maths is one of the most important in management entrance tests. If one considers Data Interpretation as part of maths, then the quantitative portion is 2/3rd of the paper. People who are weak in maths need not fear since a logical approach will help clear this section quite easily. Topics like number systems, percentages, profit and loss, time and distance, must be thoroughly done. A large part of the paper has algebra too, so the student must have complete knowledge of quadratic equations, functions, logs and the like.Questions on geometry and co-ordinate geometry are also asked. Hence a strategic approach towards such topics is necessary which can be taught only by the one who is experienced. Faculty at Catking are not only experienced but also Toppers of their field.

However, that does not mean one should wait till then.   If you have more time at your disposal, it would be better to start preparing right away.  So, let's take it on a phase-by-phase basis.Phase I.   Utilize time to chalk out a preparation strategy for maximum efficiency and to improve your vocabulary and general awareness (both of which cannot be done as part of a crash course)1. Analyze your strengths and weaknesses Do numbers scare you? Has probability always been a foe? Are the RC passages long and boring and put you to sleep? What about your reading speed? Is it 100 wpm or 200? Is it enough? Do words like factitious and proclivity confuse you?  Then start to work on them.2. Start reading The best way to build a vocabulary and a critical mindset which will come handy while attempting the Verbal and RC section of the examination is by reading. Read anything - books, novels, newspapers, magazines, blog posts, other online articles etc.  This will also help you to increase your reading speed (anything below 300 wpm will be a deterrent) and also to focus in case the topics in the examination are dry (for example, History, Politics etc)  Set a reading target. Also, have a target list ready.  A good place to begin will be the BBC list of Top 100 Books. A book a week would enable you to finish all 100 in less than 2 years.3. Start working on your problem solving abilities Start reading through brain-teasers. Solve logical problems. Start exercising your brain cells to boost your IQ. This exercise will be useful not only for the examination but also for your life in general.4. Extra focus on vocabulary Building a good vocabulary is a tedious exercise; one that requires a tremendous amount of patience and persistence. Thankfully, there are many tools and hacks to help you with it - word maps, flash cards etc. These visual aids always help.Phase II.  Now would be a good time to join a coaching class and start working with a schedule and deadlines ready.  Many people ask if coaching is mandatory and if you can crack the exam without it. The answer is NO; it is definitely not mandatory, however, it would be helpful because of the following reasons: Discipline: Procrastination is something everyone encounters in case of assignments with long deadlines. The same is the case here. Unless you commit to a classroom schedule, people generally tend to put it off for future. Having classes and having paid for all of them in advance ensures that you attend them, at the very least, listen to the instructor and soak in the very basic concepts.Competition and bench-marking: The classes give you a glimpse of the competition you are going to face moving forward. You would find people who come prepared for every class, listen intently to everything being said and take down meticulous notes. The same motivates you to also start working your ass off.Faculty: These guys who are going to teach you have years of experience. They are fairly familiar with the exam pattern, the types of questions that are asked and tricks to solve them in the shortest time possible.Ensure that you attend all classes and are at par with everyone else. Take out time to revisit the concepts once after the class. Trust me, it makes a lot of difference to how much of the same is retained by you.  Phase III:  This is the most important phase. Time to finally put everything you have learnt to test. Every coaching center has their own test series where you can give any no. of mock tests and you are given a percentile score to benchmark you against your peers.   A few pointers:· Aim to complete 2 mock tests per week i.e. 16 - 20 in 2 months. This will give you ample time to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses and to fine tune your strategy· Every mock test result should be analyzed and monitored to ensure that you are making clear progress with every subsequent attempt· Apart from mock tests, there are sectional tests. If after, say 5 tests, you realize that you are weak in one particular area, head over to that section and practice away. Sectional tests are around 10-20 questions for about 30 minutes each.Phase IV : A few (10-12) days before the exam  You should ideally relax for a week before the exam.1. Just read a couple of daily newspapers and avoid reading anything else so as not to cluster your mind with unnecessary information.2. Preferably pick up a book you have already read and one that you immensely adore. Re-read it.3. Listen to music.4. Talk to friends.5. Go to a good movie.6. Avoid the temptation to attempt ""one last"" mock test. At any cost. (If, by ill fate or due to nervousness, the outcome is not good, it might deeply hamper your performance in the actual exam)7. Do anything you like - if you are a painter, paint; if you are a guitarist, practice; but the most important part, take a good power nap. It will help you to relax, and will make you more productive.Cheers!","Start with confidence, whether you begin by yourself or join a coaching. Now what is this confidence that I am talking about? - CAT is an aptitude test - you have the inherent aptitude - all you need is brushing up. CAT prep is like getting ready for the big event, the skill already lies inside you. This is the CAT confidence!Now, how to plan:1.BASIC MODULE: Till 15th Septembera.Complete the basics of all the major topics once. <In class, through examples etc. Etc. Solving 10-15 questions from each chapter just to make sure that you are conceptually there should be enough>b.Read newspaper editorial for at least 30 days. Read 3-4 good novels at least – preferably authors like Ayn Rand, Robin Sharma etc. Who focus on philosophy or motivation themes.c.Appear for 2-3 full mocks just to build these four thingsi.Exam temperamentii.Accuracyiii.Selectioniv.Speed2. ADVANCED MODULE: 15th September to 15th Octobera.Focus on the CAT important topics at an advanced level (Those 10 chapters which will give you 60+ questions in CAT). Solve these topics from 1. Your advanced sheets/books 2. Your topic test module (online/offline) – do give tests to make sure that you build practice on speed as well. During the test focus on speed maximization. At the end of the test, try to solve/read solutions/clear doubts of all questions that you got wrong. Also focus on those that you could not solve. Check your mistakes/selection. Question your judgement in attempting and try to understand the pattern of your mistakes in solving/selection. Make sure you don’t repeat these mistakes in the coming tests.i.Chapter 1: Reading Comprehensionii.Chapter 2: Para jumbles/completion/summarizationiii.Chapter 3: Time, Speed, Distance, Workiv.Chapter 4: Percentage, Solution mixtures, Profit and Lossv.Chapter 5: DI Pie-Line Charts and Tabular DI. Connecting/linked tables - up to 3.vi.Chapter 6: Grouping, selection, team/matrix formation,tournaments and set theory - up to 4 sets.vii.Chapter 7: Geometry and Mensurationviii.Chapter 8: Quadratic equation/inequality and maxima minimaix.Chapter 9: Factors, remainders and divisibilityx.Chapter 10: Arrangements(Linear/Circular) and ordering/ sequencingb.For all other chapters, if time doesn’t permit – just solve 10-15 advanced questions each chapter from your books and revise it once more before CAT. It is not necessary to do tests on every topic as time won’t be enough to do it all.FULL MOCKS: Do give at least 4 full mocks this month3. Final lap: 16th October to 25th November: THE TRIMURTI FORMULA – your standard week!a.50 days left to CAT: I recommend following a STANDARD SCHEDULE now.i.TIRMURTI DAY 1: 16th Oct: Give a mock CATii.TRIMURTI DAY 1-2: 16-17th Oct: Analyze the paper after the exam at three levels1.Solve each unsolved question and understand the solution. See if you could have done it in the exam in given time and analyze whether your decision to not attempt it in the exam was right or wrong.2.Solve each wrongly attempted question and ensure that you learn from your mistake so that it doesn’t get repeated in the next exam. Wrong attempts should seriously be catered to else they become your enemies in the exams to come.3.Read the solution to the questions you got right and see if there exists a shorter solution or not!iii.TRIMURTI DAY 3: 18th Oct: Revise/Practice any topic that you think is letting you down in mocks.iv.19-20-21st Oct: Repeat the 3 day TRIMURTI pattern but this time on a previous year CAT paper.v.22nd Oct: Take a break – have fun, listen to English music and read a good novel. <This is the seventh day. So every week has 1 full mock, 1 previous year paper, analysis and revision followed by a one day break>​4.THE LAST WEEK: 26th November to 3rd Decembera.26-29th Nov: Read all the concepts that you have learnt till now. Keep making notes. Make a small TOOL BOOK/ Concept Summary of your class/coaching notes or study till now.b.1-3 October: Read CAT relevant articles – Philosophy, Psychology and Socioeconomic/Culture based articles from Wikipedia.THE KEY IS: Work, improve, check your progress and improvement.Also remember, balance your thought process properly. As you cover more and more syllabus, grow in confidence. Confidence that I can select and solve questions in the exam is the key to happy CATting! Remember, start your day with a laughter! Dive into every day with energy. Work smart, sharp and hard each day. End your day with a big smile and in a hope of reliving the laughter moment the next morning.Create strong support systems. Cut down on time extravagance and be with people who can help you perform better by understanding your exam preferences and sincerity.The article has been taken from my institute blog: Source(How to crack CAT in 4 months? by Rahul Anand Sir(alum, IIM A; Director, B-Factory))Best of luck!Rahul Sir","This the same answer I gave to a different question. But well, the questions are similar as well.Let me burst some myths first if possible.Reading newspapers in NOT sufficient or necessary for Verbal Ability preparation. I got through without reading newspaper, though I had to read it in preparation for interviews.Theoretical books DON’T help you clear Quant or LRDI. All you need from the books is practice.The so-called shortcuts do not help everyone. For example, I never do multiplication using the ‘vedic multiplication techniques’. But, put me in a contest with anyone who does that and I will always win. Only because I practiced a lot and the usual method works for me better.There is no set method to solve any kind of question. If there was, everyone would be able to answer that question. The ones who prepare the exam want people who can think. Not people who prepare.Self-preparation? I am sorry to say this, but it doesn’t work like that. Very few, probably 20–30 out of 2 lakh can do that. No one is that good. You need to get inputs from others regularly. There are a lot of things that you wouldn’t know if you study on your own.CAT is not enough! Don’t make it your sole aim to get through CAT. Interviews which come after CAT are equally, if not more, important.Now, Let’s see a general outline to improve yourself till the exam.Start writing Mocks immediately. I consider them the most important part of preparation. I took so many mocks that I felt the CAT exam as another mock. That removed a lot of pressure.Mocks give you an idea where you stand. Take it up from there. Analysis each mock you write for probably half an hour. You would know your strong and weak areas from 3–4 mocks.For verbal, reading is very important. But, rather than reading, the way you read it more important. Newspaper doesn’t help much because the style of writing is factual. There are different styles of writing and you need to be aware of all. So, read different books. There are going to be around 6 passages. These will from the domains of philosophical, historical, scientific, fictitious and reporting. Most important -’You cannot spend more than 5 minutes on any passage.’ Basically, you have to glance through the passage after reading the first paragraph in detail. You need to spend atleast 2 minutes on each question in the passage. Don’t just answer. Read the question thoroughly. I got 95 percentile in Verbal in 2015. 99.91 in 2016. Why? This was the change I adopted.Practice a lot for Quant and DILR. But, don’t ever just practice. If it was that easy, every who can do hard-work will get through. Develop your thinking abilities. Try to devise atleast 2 ways of solving every single problem. Especially for quant, try to look at the way in which you can solve the problem without using pen, paper or calculator. To develop your calculating abilities, whenever you are free to do this - Take two 3-digit numbers at random and try to multiply them in your mind. Then, check it by hand. This will help you in DILR. Look at which method works for you the best.Last but not the least, let me recommend two things for you-Try as much as possible to limit your rough work. You are not guaranteed to get more than two rough sheets in the exam. I recommend using 2 sides for DILR, 1 and half side for Quant and half if required for verbal.I recommend not using calculator for quants. I assure you from the experience of atleast 50 mocks from TIME and 2 actual CAT exams that using the onscreen calculator for quants just wastes time.Hope I was helpful.You can also follow my Blog for regular updates on preparation.cat2017prep.blogspot.in"
CAT,I'm scoring just 40-50 percentile in CAT mocks. How can I prepare for 99+ percentile?,https://www.quora.com//Im-scoring-just-40-50-percentile-in-CAT-mocks-How-can-I-prepare-for-99+-percentile,"Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests, Personal Question",13,"First and foremost, I would suggest you to stop being so obsessed with mock scores. You’re yet to do justice to your preparation and once you’ve actually practiced enough, you’ll see major improvements. Use mock tests for assessing your weaknesses, not as a parameter of your potential. The only thing you can have control over is your preparation and hard work. CAT is a very unpredictable exam and focusing more on your preparation rather than the end result will be more productive for you.More importantly, here are some suggestions that might help you with your preparation.This is for people who are planning to write CAT and is based on my personal experiences and what I learned during my CAT journey. You might disagree with some of these things, and I am open to suggestions from each one of you.First and foremost thing that you need to do is bring a huge change in the way you do things every day. Try and utilize every single minute of free time for preparation. Whenever free, try and do something that will help you in one way or the other (mental calculations/reading/revising formulas etc).People in a very demanding job, stop giving excuses that you are not able to study because of work. Even though it is true, there is nothing that you can do about it except maybe resign (The worst possible thing that you can do for CAT prep). So take it as a challenge. 2 hrs per day on weekdays and 6 hrs per day on weekends is more than enough for scoring a very good percentile in CAT. Enjoy this preparation, this struggle. Do not think about the result too much, focus on the process, the journey.I will give you some key points in no specific order -1. If you are a 1st timer, write a mock test, any mock, and get a rough idea as to where you stand right now.2. Get hold of study material from any institute and make sure that you go through at least QA and LR from start to end asap.3. A very important thing (that most people don't do) is that every time you try and solve questions, do it with time limit. Right from the very first question of the study material you pick up. CAT is a speed based game these days and you'll be able to develop that skill only with practising speed day in and day out. Every time you plan to study even for a stretch of say 30 mins, plan to solve say 18-20 questions in those 30 mins with a timer and try and maximise your score in this. This way, you'll develop the art of leaving questions. And then devote another 30-60 mins to learn from the questions you couldn't solve or solved wrongly. Practising within time limits makes your brain think faster and more efficiently under stress and you try and maximise your score this way. I repeat, DEVELOP THE ART OF LEAVING QUESTIONS.4. Once you start writing mocks, maintain an excel sheet to keep track of questions in VA and QA topic wise. After every mock, during analysis, just fill this excel sheet, something like this -VARC -At the end, apply a formula that will give you details about % attempt (A/T*100) and % accuracy (C/A*100) topic wise. After 10-15 mocks, you'll be very clear about which topic you are attempting less, where your accuracy is pathetic etc etc. It will help you much more than you realise. Around Sept/Oct when you'll be finalising a strategy for the final exam, this data will help you in deciding how to approach the paper. It definitely helped me a lot.5. Maintain a thick notebook with all the QA formulas and keep updating it with every mock/sectional test you give. Revise it once every 20-30 days. By Oct, these formulae should become an extension of your mind. Recalling them instantaneously during mocks/CAT is VIMP. You can utilise travel time to office for revising this, I did.6. Mental calculations are very important. As pagalguy CAT legend calls it, THINK without INK. You can practice this on a regular basis. Do whatever calculations you do during work/college without a calculator. As much as possible. In these 8 months, you can develop this skill exponentially by practising it daily. Challenge yourself. Lying in bed, about to sleep, ask yourself, what is 347x218? What is 59674-47392? Now try and visualize this. Make these calculations a habit and a part of your life. Trust me, it will help you in more ways than you can imagine even long after the CAT is over.7. For VA/RC, people say that reading a lot of novels and newspaper helps. But I feel that reading helps a lot, definitely. But instead of investing time in novels/newspapers, invest that same amount of time in solving RC passages on various themes and topics (With a time limit of course). This way, you'll practice a lot of reading as well as you'll also practice spotting answers for questions. Buy any popular book with 100s of RCs and start doing this.8. About books, I can't really comment about which one to go for as I didn't use any. My preparation was only from 47 mock tests I wrote and 40+ sectional tests.9. Mock tests are the single most important step in your CAT preparation. It prepares you for the final battle by simulating the same. Enroll in at least one among the big 3 and if possible, enrol in two (I would recommend SIMCATs+AIMCATs). Take every single mock very very seriously. You could write 30 mocks or 130 (depending on the amount of time that you can devote for CAT prep), but please take all of them very seriously. Analysing mocks is twice as important as writing one. Find out why you solved a particular question wrong or why you left a particular question. Update the 'thick notebook' that you made for QA with new formulas/concepts that you see in these mock tests' solutions. Solve the unsolved RCs/DILR sets later on (Try and do this too in time limits). Devote more time to analysing mocks than to write them. Learn everything that you can from every mock that you write. Try and write the next mocks only after analysing previous mock thoroughly. You will find this analysis very difficult and you'll have an urge to just skip it and write the next mock, but don't. I personally analysed only 38 out of 47 mocks thoroughly due to lack of time. Do this analysis not just for mocks but for sectional tests as well.10. DO NOT try to do too many things. Someone will try and do mocks, various books from Indian authors, even GMAT books, then lots of reading, then improve grammar with several grammar improvement books, then vocab improvement books, solving questions on pagalguy, solving questions on various sites, various study materials etc etc etc. KEEP IT SIMPLE. Don't get caught up with all this. Don't ask for too many suggestions. Talk to a few good people, make a good plan that you feel will work for you and just do it.11. Try and improve your English writing and speaking skills as much as you can today onwards. Practice it at home/office/college as much as you can. This will help you a lot during the final step after CAT result. This is something that will take time to improve (Only for those who are not too comfortable with English)12. DO NOT get affected by a change in pattern or any other changes. Take it as a challenge and as an opportunity to develop yourself as per the need.13. A time will come when things will not go your way at all. Your mock scores will fall and you'll start doubting yourself. DON'T. Get yourself up and fight harder. No matter how bad the performance is, keep going. Trust me, you'll face this, but don't let it demotivate you. Take it as a reminder that you've so much to learn.14. Develop a balanced performance across all 3 sections. This is very important. Devote more time to your weak areas and work on it until you are good at that too.14. Keep calm. Develop this skill with every mock you write. This way, you'll not get all tensed up during CAT and will be able to perform to your full potential. You'll be able to take CAT as just another mock test.15. Stop wasting time. As Madonna puts it, ""I am gonna delay my pleasure"". Delay it for 9 months, all those parties, movies, hangouts can wait. Right now, FOCUS.NEVER SETTLE","I am sharing you basic top strategy for CAT exam section wise. You can apply the same in mocks , check results and improvise. Recently few students could increase their percentile from 75 to 95 in Mocks using this strategy. For a personalised strategy according to your performance, please contact me .*Strategy For VA+RC*1. Try to attempts VA last , as in the last 10 minutes it is difficult to solve a new RC but VA can be easily done.2. While starting, read the topic , first few lines of RC,(avoid abstract of difficult topics you are not comfortable) , questions asked (you may avoid tone/style questions type RC first, questions which ask to arrange the options or such, and cannot be determined options).3. Now mark first question of each RC. This will help you to jump from one RC to another easily.4. After this process , solve first 3-4 RC with more no .Of questions , comfortable topics and questions.5. When you read RCs , you can read some questions so that you can get a rough idea where you need to concentrate. Don't try to read twice -thrice and waste more time in RC.6. Try to have min of 15-20 mins after solving 3-4 RC sets , so that you can solve VA.7. For VA , solve the easier one you are comfortable with. Don't guess work here if it is a negative marking . Target 5-6 questions here. You can choose fine odd one out, paragraph questions , or parajumbled as you are comfortable.Note: Always see you click save after marking an option. Your target here should be 20-24 questions with an accuracy of 80%+ to get an ideal 90%.Strategy for LR+DI section:1. First scroll all LR and DI sets , mark first question of each LR DI set you are gonna do. There can be a mix of LR+DI instead of 4 DI first and LR last. So be prepared.2. Selection of top 3-4 LR DI sets is important. You should choose according to sets. (Avoid the ones you always do wrong/skip in mocks or finding complex), check questions too and you may avoid such sets where question are complex and tricky .3. Don't guess work in LR DI sets . It may happen first question is not doable or you are not able to all questions of the set. Don't panic leave that question and do rest.4. Target atleast 3-4 LR-DI sets if they are difficult. 5-6 LR-DI for a moderate to easy sets. Here your accuracy should be more than 90%. This can easily fetch you 90%+5. While solving LR sets , always try to put information on the paper using some notation or short tricks. Like in a family chain question, you can put a circle for male and square for female. You can put an arrow connecting two persons if identified married. Similar way. Such notations in all sets of LR is helpful.6. For DI or data sets, always try to put information in table format , if required in set format. Don't directly go on solving all unknown. First read the questions what it is asked and then go ahead.*Strategy for Quants*1. Read all 34 questions. There can be easy questions at end too.2. In first 20-25 minutes , try to scroll till 34 questions . Solve easiest of all. Mark doable lengthy or little moderate ones. 10 questions should be solved. 10 may be marked for review to do later.3. In next 20-25 minutes, now Jump to marked for review . Again be choosy. Skip , don't stuck and solve again easier ones first.4. Remaining time 10 mins (if any) can be used to select some remaining marked for review or other questions you feel you can attempt.5. Do not guess answer and mark randomly. It is important to have a good accuracy. Always use clean rough sheet and circle important information and outcomes to avoid missing any.Note : Decent attempts should be 20-21 with an accuracy of 80%+ to get a 90 percentile + in CAT.Disclaimer: This is a just recommended strategy from Funda Clear Team. You can have your own improvised and constable strategy. Also Percentile and minimum attempts is subject to level of difficulty in CAT and relative performance as well.Funda Clear TeamFundaClear","Becoming a 99+ percentiler needs the focus, time management, efficiency.

To know more about it visit - Best CAT Coaching","Hey!You are attempting mocks means you have cover 75% syllabus of CAT (I assume) because without covering 75% syllabus mock is just a formality. 40–50 percentile in mock is not so bad but not so good also if you are attempting good mock series who matches the level of CAT. Now you have to focus on improving percentile in mocks. Improvement can be done by recognizing our mistakes during mock than workout on those mistakes. Analysis of mock will help you in this.Analysis every mock and Keep following points in your mind during this-Focus on the number of errors made. Try to minimize errors, they don’t have more than 2 in QA section, not more than 2 in LRDI section, not more than 20% in VARC section. If you are doing more error than this number means you are also attempting those question also whom your are not 100% sure.Look beyond scores and percentiles. Score and percentile is just a number, they might make you feel good or bad but you have to look beyond this.Attempt the entire paper again. An average CAT aspirant attempts 50–60 question in mock mean they have miss out a large number of good questions. Re-attempt it again without time pressure.Analyze your question, set, passage selection. After re-attempt the mock evaluate yourself on those parameters- Did I attempt the correct questions in Quant?, Did I pick the right sets in LR/DI?, Did I pick the right passages in RC? etc in my first attempt.Identify the strategy that works best for you. Follow a strategy that will help you to solve more question. According to me attempt every section in two phases. In phase 1 attempt all easy question that you can solve easily in less time and mark those question that can be solved by you but they take more time. In phase 2 attempt all marked question. This strategy will sure you that you don’t leave any easy question.Figure out the number of mocks you need. Attempt at-least 10 mocks before CAT exam.Do not attempt section wise mock. Always attempt full length mocks. Because full length mocks will feel you actual exam not section wise mock.Identify your weak areas. After analysis 2–3 mocks, you will identify your weak areas and than work out on that before attempting next mock.Check if you are slipping in your strong areas. Some time this happen when you are over confident on your strong area and don’t give enough time to this. You can identify this during identify weak area. This should not be happen, if this is happen than work out on it also.Plan your next mock. After a mock analysis you can allot time for your weak area, other thing etc than schedule next mock.Helping Hand to Improve Weak AreasOnline course is the one of best way to improve your weak areas.

CAT,What are the things that make XAT different from CAT?,https://www.quora.com//What-are-the-things-that-make-XAT-different-from-CAT,Common Admission Test (CAT),6,"The two big differentiators between XAT and CAT are:Decision Making: This section does not appear in CAT or for that matter in any other Management Entrance Exam. This is kind of a combination of Logical Reasoning and Reading Comprehension where a case study is given and aspirants are put in the shoes of a manager and asked to make a decision. The choices can often be confusing in such questions. Quite a few students neglect it and do so on their own peril. I teach an online course on Decision Making, which can be accessed here: XAT 2014 Decision Making Online Comprehensive Coaching by Ravi HandaGeneral Knowledge: Although GK will not be a part of the score which will be used to give out calls to aspirants but it will be used in later stage of admission by XLRI and some other colleges. This section is also missing in CAT. I teach an online course on GK, which can be accessed here: General Awareness for MBA covering Business Awareness & Current NewsEssay Writing: Students would be asked to write an Essay after the main paper is over. Once again, this is unique to XAT.","XAT ExamXAT is a National Level Entrance Exam which is directed by XLRI Jamshedpur. The exam is directed in the online mode through CBT. Through this exam, applicants get admission to 150+ B schools in India. There is a negative stamping of 0.25 checks in the exam.Qualification – The understudies must have a four year college education from a perceived college.Application Process Starts – The application procedure for XAT exam begins in the third seven day stretch of August.About the Exam – XAT exam isolated into two sections 2 sections. Objective and abstract sort questions are asked in the exam. Despite the fact that there is no particular prospectus for the XAT exam, However, Verbal and Logical Ability, Decision Making, QA and DI, GK and paper composing questions are asked in the exam. Through the XAT exam, the understudies can get admission to a Number of courses, for example, BM, HRM, GBM, GMP. There are 47 exam focuses in India though 2 focuses abroad.CAT ExamCAT is a standout amongst the most essential MBA Entrance exam. Consistently around 2 lakh understudies endeavors the CAT exam to get confirmation in the best B schools and IIM's.

Enrollment starts in the second seven day stretch of August.HOW IS XAT DIFFERENT FROM CAT EXAM?The basic leadership segment – Majorly the Decision-Making segment does not show up in the CAT while it does in the XAT exam. The understudies are given the assignment of a director and need to get to a choice. General Knowledge area is a segment that isn't a piece of the score yet it will be tallied in the later phase of affirmation by XLRi and a portion of the acclaimed universities.Both CAT and XAT exam have a regular cutoff. The thing that matters is acknowledgment of lower Marks. CAT has something which XAT doesn't have and that is the Individual day by day session insightful cut-off estimation for the entire 20-25 days window and spots the outcome in like manner.Method of Exam – The applicants can take note of that both of the exams pursue the distinctive method of exams. The XAT is directed in the traditional Pen and Paper mode though the CAT exam is led in the online mode as a CBT.Likewise, XAT exam is led in a solitary day though it takes 20-25 days in two areas consistently.","The basic difference between CAT and XAT are :The Decision-Making and GK section in XAT exam is different from the regular verbal, RC, QA, DI and LR sections. The DM section is a combination of LR and RC skills along with critical reasoning as well. But it is definitely different from the regular LR questions in any exam.Also in the case of XAT, you have 0.05 negative marking in case you leave more than 8 to 13 questions unanswered.","If you want to become a managementgraduate and make a mark in themanagement of business here or abroad,there are many Management Education bothState-run and private, which can provide youthe requisite degree.

CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,What should I do if I am unable to decide which post graduate preparation should I chose between M.Tech in mechanical engineering through GATE or MBA through CAT?,https://www.quora.com//What-should-I-do-if-I-am-unable-to-decide-which-post-graduate-preparation-should-I-chose-between-M-Tech-in-mechanical-engineering-through-GATE-or-MBA-through-CAT,"GATE Mechanical Engineering, Postgraduate Education, Mechanical Engineering Career Advice, Graduate School Education, Common Admission Test (CAT), Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE), Master of Business Administration Degrees, Mechanical Engineering",6,"This is a tough question to answer for you. It has more to do with asking yourself what you really like to do, engineering or business. There may be some other motivations mixed in such as long term income prospects, job environment, type of people you will meet and work with. That said I think that there is more mobility and more value in pursuing engineering for a number of years and then getting an MBA in the sub-area you find interesting as a means to open up your career options. Businesses may like an MBA with a sound engineering education and experience that proves the ability to take a quantitative approach to decision making and the understanding of an important side of a business. In engineering we also try to discipline ourselves to find the simple solution to problems. This has value later in business. I personally feel the career transition from an MBA based business career to an engineering career would be harder. It may take a frustrating length of time after you enter engineering to get the business decision making responsibility your MBA prepared you for and may have led you to expect. I don't think you would be likely to move in this direction unless you just found business was not to your taste and by then you would be significantly behind in the new engineering career. But this is my own perspective. Why not bounce this hypothesis off some people you can find in each career area? It will give you at least an entry point for the discussion.","This is the common mistake that people do. Let me assume that there is a guy with the name “John” and this is how his thought process is when he is on the crossroads of deciding a career path.In John’s mind:-If I take CAT and get into IIMs, preferably A/B/C, how much will I be making on an average? How good is that when compared to the top IITs or the pay I get without a loan burden in PSU jobs?Oh! Wait… I can even avoid the loan burden by getting into FMS. Or should I rather give a try to GATE before going for an MBA as it will be an utter wastage of my technical talent? But how well is an MTech from an old IIT considered as compared the old IIMs?Let me check the average salaries, life, fun, campus photographs/videos, the companies that I can potentially get into after completing the respective degrees etc….And finally, John decides on something. After starting the preparation he understands that there are thousands of people like who stepped into something only by looking at what the top 1% of the candidates can potentially get. He may or he may not get into that, now that totally depends on John’s expertise, competence, practice, and skill.What is more important is creating a solid Plan B. What if you fail? What if you get to know that you are nowhere close to the top 10% of candidates when you take the mock tests? So, explore career paths properly, don’t just do something only because the people around you are doing it.In the case of CAT, over 2 lakh people take it and only 5k+ students get into their dream colleges or top B-Schools. The rest either sit for another attempt or settle down for something low. Similar is the case with GATE.","Its all upto you. What side of career are you interested in?If you want a purely technical job and dont give a shit about its business aspect then Mtech is the way to go.However if these 4 years of engg. have drained out all the potential in you, try for an MBA.P.S. - If you are still confused 1. MBA can be done anytime after you get a job. however same is not the case for Mtech. Once you lose your continuity you will never be able to score well. Best time for an Mtech is just after graduation when you still retain majority of the concepts.2. MBA has more value if you have some experience. Even the IIM interviews are partial towards people who can correlate the course with their job. 3. There are many types of MBAs. Dont just rush in with the crowd before knowing wheter its gonna actually benefit you. This is where your work ex. plays a greater role. After 2-3 years on the job you would know which  course is better for you & should invest your time in.Hope I cleared your dilemma to some extent.","Good that you have some clarity on your higher studies. Maybe you shouldnt expect of an IIM for MBA at this early stage itself (What if you dont get into one!). There are hell lot of other better institutes in India.If you are interested in technical job after your PG, you should consider MTech.Post MBA jobs are merely number crunching & policy making, nothing much technical in them.So think over your areas of interest, consult your parents, decide."
CAT,How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-did-99+-percentilers-prepare-for-CAT,"Prepathon, Exam and Test Results, Common Admission Test Percentiles, Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",100+,"My authority on the subject? I scored a 99.75 percentile in CAT, 99.55 in XAT, 99.45 in SNAP. This is a walkthrough of my preparation/ how you can go about preparing for CAT and other entrance exams.CAT is considered to be one of the most difficult entrance exams in India, but it is isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most of the topics that are tested in CAT are High school level topics. The difficulty lies in the fear of the test. Most CAT aspirants resign to an assumption that they can’t score above a certain percentile without even knowing what the test is made off, half the game is lost at this point.I have been guilty of the same myself. Jan 2016, I remember looking at lists of MBA colleges and immediately rejecting the top 30 odd colleges for the fact that they all required you to score above 97 percentile or so to realistically make into those colleges. It was only when I talked to my father and he explained to me the negativity in my thinking, that I realised, I hadn’t even seen what CAT consisted of. I had no logic in leaving out the possibility of scoring an extremely high percentile.Another reason why I felt that I had to score an extremely high percentile were my 12th class marks. MBA colleges give weightage to academic profile. A self-analysis made me realise that having a low score in my 12th class (69%) was a huge handicap. If I had got a low percentile I would’ve found it extremely difficult to make into the colleges of the relevant level. I would’ve ended up in colleges ranked even lower. I had to score a 99+ percentile. BELIEVE you can Crack the CATHow to go about:I have divided the preparation for CAT into four parts:Pre-preparation, Preparation, Practice, Taking the CATPre-PreparationThere are a few things you’ll want to have in place before you start your preparation for CAT and other exams.Find three hours a day (not in bits and pieces here and there) three continuous hours to prepare. This can be extremely difficult if you are working/ attending college. This might help you to find a few extra hours a day.Get rid of any distractions that you believe affect your concentration or mental state in general. (social media is one of the biggest time-suck and tends to distract you even if you aren’t online)Get in touch with someone who has cracked the entrance exam or has some expertise in the same, you could approach a local coaching centre. (you may not enrol as a full-time student but you would want to be in touch with the faculty there by buying their material or tests etc.) This will be helpful in getting certain finner tips and in case you have difficulties.Get yourself a campaign manager. Cracking the CAT and getting an admission into an MBA college is a long drawn process. You are bound to lose interest or forget important things/ deadlines. Get someone who will keep track of the same. For me, it was my father who helped me keep track of my preparation and all the college applications. Make sure the person you chose exactly understands the process and understands what you want. They will make sure that you are still going even when the motivation starts to run out.Read a lot. This is extremely important when it comes to the verbal ability section of CAT. You will need a lot of broad-based readings and an ability to make sense of what you have read quickly. The passages for reading comprehension in CAT are sometimes extremely abstract and can be extremely difficult to make sense if you aren’t used to reading a lot. Places where you should want to read from: Medium, The guardian, Businessweek Bloomberg, Also read some classic novels that you can lay your hands on, the books talked about on crash course literature are a good place to start.PreparationCAT is divided into 3 sections verbal ability reading comprehension, logical reasoning data interpretation, and quantitative ability. Each of the sections requires equal effort and attention.Time for preparation: There are many people and sites who will tell you that you need 14 hours a day to prepare for CAT. Trust me that doesn’t work. You just need 3 to 4 hours a day consistently over a period of 3- 4 months to crack CAT. Anything more than 5 hours a day can and will burn you out.Source material for preparation: A common mistake that most aspirants will make is relying on just one book/ one source for preparation (particularly anyone who takes coaching). It is recommended that you have access to at least some material from different authors. This will provide you with multiple points of view for the same problems. (same goes for mock tests recommended that take at least 4 to 5 tests from A differen source).Verbal Ability & Reading ComprehensionThis is one of the most frustrating sections in CAT. The question often can seem to have multiple solutions and where options are provided all of them seem correct. Even if you are extremely good with English you can end up messing this section.The key to cracking this section (particularly Verbal ability part) is understanding that this section is more about logic than language. You have to understand the logic as to how the solutions are arrived at (jumbled para is the killer in this section).I initially worked this section by looking at the solutions, that way I was able to see what patterns to look out for and what logic to apply.Work on improving your ability to comprehend complex /long sentences, particularly from topics that you aren’t used to and having complex vocabulary.This section will take a lot of practice to master, more practice than the other two sections. This section has the highest returns for scores. If you get a slightly higher score in this section your percentile can increase drastically. (I scored a 99.98 percentile in this section).Even if you have a good command over the language DO NOT take this section lightly, I know of aspirants who have the CAT along with me having excellent command over the language yet messing up this section completely.Data interpretation and logical reasoningData interpretation is a practice intensive section. There is nothing new that you have to learn in this section. It is just the ability to carry out basic calculations using tools you already have (percentages, averages, summation, division). Practice these basic tools thoroughly so that you are extremely comfortable with them. Also get acquainted with all the various forms of data presentation, such as graphs, pie charts, tables, caselets etc.Logical reasoning is a section which you should and can make the most out of it. The questions are very often similar. While practising logical reasoning the things you would want to learn is gauging the difficulty of the question quickly. If a question is difficult, move on to the next one (time is important).You would want to practice visualising the problem (in mind / on paper ) in the simplest way possible. This will help you breakdown huge paragraphs full of seemingly meaningless words into sensible data.Learn to have an unbiased mind. One of the mistakes you can make in this section is assume somehting that isnt true. Learn to use all the information provided and only than make any conclusion.Read the data carefully a single word can change the whole situation. (for ex. XYZ is not wearing a black pant. can easily be mistaken for XYZ wearing a pant if you miss out on the not.)Quantitative abilityThis is one of the more easier sections to get by, You just have to understand the concepts behind all the topics involved. Again the topics in this section are high school level math. You can over prepare for this section and most aspirants do.There are certain topics in this section that you would want to be extremely thorough with since they appear most frequently (going by the trends of past so many years), such as time speed distance, time work, Geometry, Functions.You would want to also be thorough with averages alligations, percentages ratios since these topics are more helpful in DI section but very rarely make an appearance as stand-alone questions in QA section.Number systems personally I felt for me was an extremely overrated topic ( I spent way more time than required here)PracticeTaking mock tests, I feel mock tests will be the most important part of your preparation as they help you guage exactly where you stand. (another benefit is to know which colleges you should apply to).What is a good number of mock tests to take? There isn’t any concensus on this topic, there are CAT toppers who got by on hardly any mock tests, and than there are people like me who took close 40 mock tests.Personally mock tests where the biggest source of practice for me. I took mock tests from 3 different sources. ( I recommend atleast 2 different sources). Once you have taken a mock test it’s extremely important that you analyse them well, I spent about an hour and half after every mock test to analyse where I have gone wrong and what can be changed. Mock tests are also a good time to test out strategies in handling various sections. (I will try to come with a detailed post about analysing mock tests.)I will boast a little here, but thanks to the trends on my mock tests I was extremely confident of getting the percentile I got on CAT. ( I expected at least a 99.5 %le)I recommend practicing during the time slot you will actually be answering the CAT, I had to take the CAT on a sunday in the morning slot (9.30 to 12.30) at a centre 30 kms away from home. Considering the reporting time of an extra hour, I would have to technically leave my house at 7 in the morning on the day of the test. I usually get hungry within 2 and half hours of eating anything. So in the month before CAT I trained my body, by having breakfast at 6 in the morning and not having anything till 1pm. I also trained myself to sit at one place for 4 hours (830 to 1230). This may seem funny/ unnecessary but on the day of the test you dont want to have any other factors troubling you.Taking the CATTry to stop preparation for CAT at least 3 days before CAT (there are people who will disagree and reccommend you remain in the mood and keep preparing) anything you try to “prepare” during these last days often will be of very little help. Don’t wander away from the CAT mood though, read or at least make sure you are sitting 3 hours at a place for these last few days ( to stay in the CAT mood).Do not take a mock test in the few days before CAT, If you mess the mock it is likely that you will panic on the day of the CAT.Do not keep any expectations as to the number of questions you want to complete in each section.All the best for your preparation for CAT.P.S. CAT isn’t everything, CAT is hardly a learning experience, you won’t learn anything new as such (well other than how to prepare hard) it’s mostly about things you already know, taking the CAT can hence be a very frustrating experience. I recommend that you learn something else too on the side lines, get a hobby or hold a job (again debatable as to how much time you can find etc.) If you are taking drop read a lot, read all the books you can get your hands on. All in all try to do something else too that will help you grow.Belling the CAT and other entrance exams","This answer is fairly long, about 7000 words. So I have divided my answer into 9 parts wherein each part can be read independently. However reading the entire answer in one go will serve as RC practice, so that would be advisable.What I have mentioned below helped me in my journey from 66% -> 99.85% in CAT. I have tried my level best to be as detailed as possible. GK as a section is not there in CAT as of now but is very important in the other papers like XAT, IIFT, SNAP, etc. So, I have included that as well. I have also put in a little bit about how to attempt mocks and then analyse them to improve further. A little bit on GD-PI-WAT as well, so that this answer serves all your needs.I would like to point out that I have been an average student all my life and am a GEM (General Engineer Male), yes pun intended. My 10/12/B.Tech scores are 83/79/66. With that I made it to IIM Calcutta, so the first thing that you should now do is stop worrying about your previous grades. 99% of the people reading this will surely have better grades. So, if I can you obviously can get through and study at an IIM.My CAT 2015 score card:QA: 99.8%LRDI: 99.96%VA: 87.33%OA: 99.85%This answer is divided into the following parts:A.) How to start?B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityC.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningD.) VA -> Verbal AbilityE.) GK -> General KnowledgeF.) How to attempt mocks? (Non-CAT exams at the end)G.) How to analyse mocks?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?I.) GD-PI-WAT prepA.) How to start CAT prep?Register at any site which lets you attempt and review a mock for free. You could try hitbullseye. If you have already enrolled for a test series or for a classroom programme, then attempt one of their mocks. Many of you would be like bhai abhi toh padhai start bhi nahi ki, mock deke kya hoga aur upar se aadhe questions toh samajh bhi nahi aayenge aur maths ke formula bhi yaad nahi hain. Additionally while attempting the mock, there will be multiple instances when you will feel like getting up because you are not used to solving questions for 3 hours at a stretch. Your brain will also try to deceive you into grabbing your smart phone for checking Whatsapp. You will feel like drinking water, you will also be tempted to check FB. The point of this test is to make sure that all this doesn’t happen when you actually attempt CAT. Now you would be thinking what is the point in attempting a mock when I don’t know $hi+.Precisely my point! The main reason for this mock was to identify what you know, what you don’t, where you stand and how much hard work is required.Once you are done with the mock, check the solutions and find the topics which you already know, which you attempted correctly. Some problems would have been there which you would have been sure of but you got them wrong because you were out of touch and forgot the formula or recalled an incorrect formula. You probably forgot the plural of fish. Fish or fishes? Or does it depend on whether I am talking about a species of fish or multiple units of the same species? Then you will realise that a little brush up of a few topics (which you are out of touch with) will dramatically improve your score. Work on these topics first and then move on to topics which you have no clue about. This mock decides your future course of study.Now, on to the preparation phase.B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityStart off with this site. http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/Click on start and then check your score. You know where you stand. Keep practising a few times every day and your score will keep improving. If you can hit 50-55 consistently in the default 120 seconds, you will easily hit 99.5% in CAT in this section. If you are targeting 99.5+ then I would also like you to memorise the following:B1.) Reciprocals, Squares and Cubes up till 30. Pay attention here, some values will get repeated. As for 1/7. Remember that it is .142857. For other go up to 2-3 decimals,whatever you are comfortable with. I would prefer 3 decimals though.B2.) Power of 2 up till 12Power of 3 up till 8Power of 4 up till 6Power of 5-6 up till 5Power of 7-10 up till 4Power of 11-13 up till 3Again same as above. Some values will be the same. 4^6 has already been covered till 2^12 and so on. Don’t just mug up blindly, pay attention to the numbers.B3.) Square Root up till 10B4.) Factorial up till 10B1-B4: Now most of you would be like, dude they give an inbuilt calculator. But then other exams don’t have that calculator. Additionally who do you think will take lesser time in solving a question? A person who uses the calculator for finding 12^3 or someone who just knows it is 1728. Believe me when I say that this is very important for your LRDI section as well. This will decide whether you get stuck at 99.5% or go beyond that. This is the deciding factor. Please memorise these values.B5.) A few important numbers like 999=27*37, 1001=7*11*13, 21^3=9261.B6.) Some numbers have the property wherein the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the no itself. 1, 2, 145 and 40585. Please remember these.B7.) There are 15 primes till 50, 25 till 100, 46 till 200 and 168 till 1000.B8.) How to find the sum of the first n natural nos. Sum of squares of n natural nos. Sum of cubes, sum of 4th powers. Please remember the formulas. Specially the last one (fourth power), most people forget that.B9.) Scale is not allowed in any of the exams. What the CAT authorities mean is that the scale which we used back in school that is not allowed. They never said anything about using your hand as a scale. Check the length of your fingers. Also check the length of the 3 sub division on your fingers. Use your right or left hand, whatever suits you. Please make sure that you remember these values by heart. These values will help you solve 90% of the geometry questions. Also, buy a protractor and make sure you can make the angles 30, 45, 60, 90 properly. First with the protractor and then without it. Based on the question, make a rough figure. Then based on your lengths, find the answer and then scale up to the value given in the question. Geometry has a lot of formulas, memorize them or use this approach. Approximation ftw!B.10.) Unitary Method. Make sure you are good with this, half the QA syllabus can be solved using unitary method. Do you think whatever has been mentioned in B9 is basically Unitary Method at the end for getting the answer?Most of the students go for solving the maximum no of problems. Don’t do that. Focus on the basics, don't go for solving questions directly like most students. Most students don’t score 99+. You are different, work differently. This is how you should be doing it for any given chapter day wise. First day go after the formulas and try to understand why a certain formula is there. Make sure that you have memorised all the formulas for that chapter. If you were to set the paper, what could be a possible question? Read a formula, try to frame questions on that formula and then memorize the formula. Just memorizing all formulas in one go won't help, because you will probably forget. If you can do this, then you would have solved all the questions by the time you finish reading the theory.Example: Let's say you are studying Numbers. You see the formulas for HCF and LCM of 2 nos. Then you see the factors of a number. Now think of possible questions on this. Let's say 72.1.) How many odd factors are there?2.) How many even factors are there?3.) What is the sum of the odd factors?4.) What is the sum of the even factors?5.) What is the product of the odd factors?6.) What is the product of the even factors?7.) How many factors are squares of natural numbers?8.) How many factors are cubes of natural numbers?Good going, you just completed half the chapter! Similarly think of more questions that you can make. The exercise at the end is filled with such questions. It depends on your thinking. Focus on this. If basics are fine,questions won't be a problem.Would you memorize 456*876 and 235*9865 and things like that or learn how multiplication works?If you think that you lack imagination when it comes to maths and can’t do the above, then no problem. As mentioned above, by the end of the first day you would be done with memorising all the formulas. That’s it. Don’t solve anything. Just make sure all the formulas are deeply rooted in your brain and you can recall them anytime you want. Now take a break for a day. On the 3rd day, start solving problems. But remember that you are to solve by recalling the formula not by turning over the pages and looking at the formula. If you cannot recall, then please make sure you memorize the formulas again. Solve a few problems. Take a day’s break and continue solving on the 5th and similarly on the 7th day as well. This way apart from the formula getting imprinted in your brain multiple times, you will also understand which formulas are asked more often than others. Some chapters are connected to one another. Make groups of such chapters. If working on a group, try to complete all the topics in that group. For example:Ratio Proportion, Unitary Method, Percentage, Profit and Loss.Simple equations, Simultaneous equations, Inequalities, Time speed distance and work, Quadratic.Progression.Numbers, Bases, Miscellaneous equations.Surds and Indices, Logarithms.Mensuration.Geometry.Coordinate Geometry.Probability and PnC.Functions and Graphs.For people trying to clear the cut off in this section. The first 3 with mensuration and a bit of geometry/numbers will be enough.C.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningData Interpretation is speed and practise. The site mentioned in the Quant region and B1-B4 there would be of immense help. These will increase your speed. Generally each and every DI set has at least a problem on percentage or ratio.Today when you start, start off with the sole intention of solving all the questions of a given set. When you can do that on a daily basis. Move to 2 sets a day. When you can do that. Move to 3 sets daily and then to 4 sets. Keep solving as many questions as you can. Time taken per question will decrease with practise. A few months after you were born, you started to crawl, then you started walking and finally you started running. Same thing here. Don’t think about speed now. Speed comes gradually. Let nature take its course.Logical Reasoning, as the name suggests is based on how well you can interpret and analyse things. LR checks your thought process, it checks how you tackle problems. Get this book ""Puzzles"" by George J. Summers. When you watch a football match, why do you watch it? Probably because you want your team to win or you want to see a good contest and enjoy. Similarly, once you have bought this book, think about your objective. It’s not about getting the correct solution, it’s about improving your thought process. And additionally the puzzles in this book are tough. You could think of it as the daddy of Irodov. Engineers will get the joke! You won’t be able to solve most of the problems and frankly speaking I don’t expect you to. However, what I do expect from you is to read a question. Try to understand what has been given. Try to understand what is being asked. Think about it for say 10-15 minutes. Write down whatever approach you can think of. If you could not solve it, look at the hints and their solution scheme. Were you thinking in the right direction?Analyse the difference between the method given in the book and your method.Try to understand what you missed because of which you could not solve the puzzle. Try again for 30 minutes. If you can solve it, good enough, if not maybe try again. After a few more tries look at the solution. Remember you bought the book to improve your thought process, not to solve each question in the first attempt. Trying a puzzle for 5 minutes and then looking at the solution will take you nowhere. Solving again and again till the time you get the answer is what the book was bought for. To make sure that you can think and get the answer on your own. The answer at the end is just for verification. 1-2 puzzles a day. 3 at max, not more than that. You have to improve your thought process,not complete the book as fast as possible. Your scores in the LR section will improve in a month’s time and then it will stay at 99%.Another very important point would be to memorize the alphabet-number conversion table. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. You will come across questions on this in your mocks as well as in the exams.D.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI had 69 and 72 in English in 10 and 12 respectively. My verbal score in CAT went up from 43 -> 87%. Whatever I have written below is what I did to make sure that I cleared the verbal cut off comfortably. If you are looking at a 99+verbal score, then you would be better off by reading the other answers to this question for improving your verbal section. This part is not for you kindly move on to the LRDI section. If you however $uck at English just like me, then this just might help you in clearing the sectional cut off. I tried memorizing words from the GRE word list. My language skills were not good enough to use words like persiflage, perspicuous, ubiquitous, scintillating, etc. in sentences. So, I would keep memorizing and then keep forgetting these words. I had never read novels so I had never come across such words as well. So, I came to the conclusion that memorising words won’t help me. But, a decent vocabulary is needed for CAT. So, I bought this book “Word Power Made Easy” by Normal Lewis. Managed to complete the chapters in a few months. I didn’t do the word list at the end. I would request you to buy this book and complete the chapters.Another thing that seemed obvious to me was that whether you look at RCs or Para Jumbles or Para Completion or Para Summary. All these have basically been written by some person who had a very good command over the English language. So all these things should logically have a flow of thought with which the author would have written the entire thing. You just have to understand that flow. If you can understand an RC, then understanding a paragraph from that RC will obviously be very easy for you. Think about it, a PJ or a PC or a PS are basically paragraphs taken from an RC. You just have to understand the flow in which the entire thing was written by some person who had a decent understanding of the English language. But, then I again had a problem. The Verbal section in CAT was supposed to be of 1 hour and as soon as I would start reading an RC, 8-10 minutes down the line I would feel drowsy. I would start thinking about checking FB or Whatsapp or practically doing anything apart from reading that stupid RC. All those Speed reading techniques, skimming, reading the question first and all. None of that mattered. I understood what my problem was. COMPREHENSION and CONCENTRATION. By the time I was in the 2nd para I would have forgotten what was written in the 1st para. It’s called a READING COMPREHENSION for a reason. Never trade comprehension for speed.How to improve comprehension and concentration?Both will improve gradually with time. First step is to make sure that you don’t feel drowsy when reading for an hour. You will be required to do that in the exam. So you need to build your stamina to concentrate. Start off by reading 2-3k word long articles on News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian. Register on the website and you will get a mail every morning at 10am. Read all the articles from there. Make sure you read at a stretch for an hour. Read everything from Culture to Technology to Art to Literature. In the beginning you will feel sleepy within a few minutes of starting. Slowly you will gain rhythm. Within 15 days you will be able to read 1 hour at a stretch. In a month’s time you will start retaining information as well. Then focus on just 1 category every day. Like only Philosophy or only Art or only culture. With that your stamina and concentration will increase further and since you are reading about only 1 thing for 1 hour, your knowledge in that topic will also increase. This can be done at home, but preferably in office to better utilize your time. PJ PC PS are all extensions of an RC. All will seem easy once you are comfortable with RCs. Here News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian you will be reading 2000-3000 word long articles. Once you are used to this, 500-600 word passages in CAT and other exams will be a piece of cake for you!For verbal, always eliminate choices and then mark rather than directly trying to find the correct answer. This section is different from the other sections,so it has to be dealt in a different manner. Please eliminate choices and then answer. If in doubt, leave. As for the grammar section, I have no idea when to use have and when to use has. Same with is/are and things like that. Neither can I spot grammatical errors in sentences. So, I mostly leave such questions.But I always read them. You can always answer a few of them based on instinct. Some sitters are always there in every paper.E.) GK -> General KnowledgeAll the papers except CAT have this section. Some have a sectional cut off,some don’t. This section can be answered in about 5 minutes. It has the highest marks/min for any section. This section is the key to a high percentile. This section will give you the points for speaking in a GD and PI and also for writing in WAT. So, if you plan on getting through to a good B-School don’t ignore it. There would be 2 methods to prepare for this.E1.) Start reading any newspaper. Go through the headlines and all. Make sure you are updated with what is happening in the country. After a week or so, you will realise that it’s mostly the same thing that keeps getting repeated everyday in the paper. Think of it from the point of view of the exam. There will be MCQs. So they won’t ask for your opinion on Kejriwal vs Modi. Leave all the pages on politics. That’s sheer wastage of time. Don’t waste time on that stuff! Make sure you remember the schemes which Mr Modi keeps rolling out. At least remember the important ones. Did any big firm buy another one? Any Indian who won some award abroad. Who won which Grand Slam? Who won the Pulitzer Prize? Who won the Arjuna Khel Ratna Award? India is working on the Chabahar port with which country? Malcom Turnbull is from which country? I think you would have understood what is expected from you. MBA is about business. Focus on economic and business news more than others. Noble Prize in economics fort his year? How many Deputy Governors are there in the Reserve Bank? Make a doc file with these details. You file would look somewhat like this.https://docs.google.com/document...This is what I had made for this year, so no this won’t help you! You will have to make one with the current affairs of this year. Since you will be working the entire year making this, so by the time the exams are a week away, you will have such a file. You might however think that this is too much work. In that case I would suggest you try the second and relatively easier method compared to this.E2.) Whichever is the first exam for you which will have a GK section, keep 4 days before that exam for making this file and memorizing it. Gather all the monthly booklets which are given to Time students. Each book has about 100 questions. Memorize the ones you think are important. CL and Time both will also have a few sheets on GK, current affairs, etc. Get those as well. CL GK compendium. Hitbullseye gk pdfs are also there. You can get most of these online for free or search on Pagalguy, someone would have uploaded it there for sure. Whatever you think is important, please memorize that. 4 days is more than enough to complete all the material I have mentioned above. By going through the monthly magazines you will also be able to keep track of what is happening in India and also round the globe.The regular reading (The first method, reading daily) means that when the exam sare about to start, you would have completed most of the things. The last 4 days will serve as a revision for you. I did both the above things. So if you have time go for it. A close friend of mine, Prateek, he was preparing for UPSC. He was of immense help! Whenever I would meet him, we would talk about how things going on in our country. Served as revision for him and I would stay updated with facts. So, if you can find someone who is preparing for UPSC religiously,i t would be great. You will also have a contact who is an IAS officer. If you want to score even higher in GK get a small yearbook from some shop. Small ones general contain 100 odd pages, going through that will serve as revision as well.F.) How to attempt mocks (Non-CAT exams at the end)The first step here is to make sure that you can sit and concentrate properly for 3 hours at a stretch. FB, Whatsapp, drowsiness, drinking water or the sudden urge to go to the washroom during these 3 hours have to be removed.Kindly take care of such things which might disturb you, especially the last 2 and then start a mock. When you are attempting the mock, the only thing in your mind should be about maximising your score! Another point that you should keep in mind in that no one cares about what you know and what you don’t. The only thing that matters is your score. So please keep your ego aside when attempting the paper. Yeh question kaise nahi bana, kal hi toh banaya tha and then you spend the next 15 mins on it and still end up marking the wrong answer. Please don’t! You have a fight with your girlfriend and then you are like “I am not texting her first”. Yes I was talking about that very ego of yours, please get rid of it when you are attempting a mock. If you can’t solve a question then please move on to the next one. The examination hall is not the place to derive a formula and then solve the concerned problem. Anyways, I could go on but I think I have made my point.Remember that half the paper is very easy, mostly formula based. Your approach should be to attempt these questions first. Make sure that you have touched the 97-98% mark and then move on to the difficult questions for improving your score.F1.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityYou are not supposed to start from question no 1 and then continue till 34. Most of the times you will not even be able to look at some of the problems in the end. So we will follow a Round by round approach. About 50% of the problems are direct formula based. When you start this section (Round 1), keep the above point in mind. So, as soon as you look at a question. Can you solve it in a minute by using a formula? If the question with a formula was given to a 5th grader, would he be able to solve it. If yes, then solve this question. Use the values given in the question, get the answer and then move on to the next question. If you see a question and you are like, yaar yeh toh banaya hua hai, 2-3 min lagega, lamba question hai. Or if you are like sirf cases likhne hain, phir count kar lunga, phir answer. Such questions which you know you can solve but are not direct formula based, are to be left out now. These have to be attempted in the 2nd round. Getting my point? If formula based, then attempt else next. Within 30 minutes you should have attempted about 16-17 questions and you would have seen all the questions. That will get you at least 97-98% in this section.Now Round 2, there were a few questions which you had seen earlier and were pretty confident about. This is where your brain will help you. The human mind is so awesome that even though you just looked at it once but solved different questions and totally forgot about it, you brain was working on that question subconsciously without you having any idea about it. Now, when you read the question, you will take a lesser amount of time to solve it compared to what you would have taken had you solved it in the first round itself. You could go for Round 3 as well, your choice! But 2 rounds are needed. Please stop with a single round method which most of you are used to now.Why this approach?Many people are most often not able to see the entire paper,so they miss sitters. This round by round technique helps you go through the entire paper and thereby select the easiest ones which in turn maximises your score. You won’t get a prize if you solve a question that only 10 students out of 2 lac could solve. The marks per question is the same. Since you solve the easier problems first, the chances of your committing mistakes goes down considerably. A question which you have solved but incorrectly is not wasted time and only a -1 for your score. Instead of 3 you get a -1. So such a question effectively hits you with lost time and a -4. This method reduces the no of such questions. Hence, this approach.F2.) DILR -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningIf you have tried solving the book which I had mentioned above, you would by now have a fair idea about how to make a table for solving LR problems. 5 people, 5 countries, 5 cars, 5 pets. All of us have solved such puzzles,haven’t we? You would obviously have 4 columns but which would be the first and which would be the second, etc. That determines how fast you will be able to solve the set. Oh, you thought it didn’t make a difference? It does! Sometimes you are better off soling set theory problems by a table. This is where your practise and experience comes into play. Making the proper table means half the work is done then and there. You just have to put in the values and tick mark the correct answers now.Now about how to attempt. When you start the section, go through the 4 LR sets.1-2 sets will be very easy. Take a couple of minutes and try to identify the easier ones. Look at the questions. Do you see any question wherein it asks how many cases are possible or questions of that sort? Such sets are to be solved at the end. Look for sets wherein directly by looking at the questions, you know that there is one unique solution. Use the answer options to further reduce your time for soling that set. Now start with such sets. First advantage of this method will be that you will feel good, because you will be done with a couple of sets in 10-12 minutes. Additionally you will be in a flow and your chances of cracking a difficult set will go up. Now compare this to the case when you start the section, and think that looking at all the questions means losing a few minutes. I am James Bond, so I will start with the first set. 10 minutes later you haven’t completed a single question and now for the remaining 50 minutes you will keep thinking, yaar 10 min faaltu mein barbaad ho gaye. Good luck solving that section and the next with such a mind-set.Many a time it will happen that the set you picked up, is going nowhere and yet time is passing on. For such sets, wherein you have already spent 4-5 minutes but haven’t been able to mark even a single question. Please leave that set.You might be tempted to think sirf 2 min aur, aur phir 4 questions ban jayenge. Please don’t commit that mistake. 5 minutes is the threshold in which you should have been able to mark at least 2 questions. Worst case scenario 1. If you are at 0. Please move on. You are better off solving that set later on,preferably at home!Same with DI sets, go through the sets, select the easier ones, and complete them. You will be left off with 2 sets. Again with 2 options, it always easy to select the easier one. This way most of the times, you will end up solving the toughest set at the end or you will probably leave it. All questions have the same marks, so isn’t it better to solve easier ones? Additionally tougher problems will also take a toll on your brain, your effectiveness for the next section might go down. Do you want that to happen?Sometimes a set will be easy but a question in there will be extremely tough.Beware of such questions, these are put in place to derail your momentum. 5-7 minutes per set is what you should be looking at. Always look at the questions and attempt. You don’t have to attempt all questions from a set. Even 3 attempts for a set is fine. Again, you know the term that I am talking about!Keep that aside when attempting a mock.F3.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI get tired of reading and lose interest quickly. So RCs at the end seems a bad idea. So, I start off with RCs. Again as soon as you start this section. Glance through all the RCs in a minute and check if any of them is from a subject you like. Your reading speed and comprehension will be higher in this case. Again as mentioned above, just because you read an RC, doesn’t mean you have to attempt all the questions. Even 4 out of 6 questions from an RC is good enough. Just attempting for the sake of increasing attempts is sheer stupidity. Please don’t think ki aree yaar itne marks toh already aa hi rahe hain exam mein. Dusron ko thoda mauka de deta hun -2 leke. Please don’t do that. Eliminate options and then attempt. When in doubt leave. Move on to the single questions after the RCs.Note -> For non-CAT mocks which you attempt online.First and foremost thing is that apart from CAT, most are pen paper based, but at home you attempt online papers for these. Take a few print outs of the OMR sheet and check how many minutes you need for marking the answers. Keep a 5 min buffer for your safety. Let’s say we talk about IIFT. It’s a 2 hour paper in real. However I need 20 minutes just for marking the bubbles. So, there is absolutely no point in attempting the online paper at home for 2 hrs. Submit the test after 100 minutes. Don’t worry if people attempt for 2 hours and your rank is low. Your score in the main exam matters, not in this one. Similarly for SNAP and XAT as well. Form a basic strategy of how you would like to attempt the paper for the 100 minutes(whatever your time is after you have checked marking in the OMR sheet). Like for Snap, I had a strategy of 5-6 minutes for gk then 16-18 minutes for verbal, then 35-40 minutes for LR. Then maths and as soon as it would be 90 minutes after the start, I would mark all the answers. Then solve and again mark in the last 5 minutes. Similarly make your strategy for IIFT, SNAP, XAT, etc. and stick to it.G.) How to analyse mock?The instant you submit a mock, you will have a score in mind, itna toh banta hai. 1 sec later the page reloads and you see your score and you go, are yaar itne toh 2 section milake hi aa jane chahiye the. This is why analysing the mock is important. You knew a certain score was achievable but your score went down drastically because of silly mistakes. Analysing mocks will take care of such mistakes. Once the solutions and result for a mock are out. First of all check up all the problems which you couldn’t solve. That’s what you have to learn.Then look at the time taken by the topper in solving a question. Look at your time. Did you take 200 seconds whereas the topper took 30 seconds? That’s because there is a technique you don’t about. Learn that technique. Write it in your notebook where you write formulas. That was about identifying and learning things which the toppers know. You have to be one of them. Go through the mocks and find such methods. AdditionallyThen there will be a category of questions you were sure of but you somehow used your talent and got it wrong and after looking at the solution you are like aree yaar yeh koi kaise galat kar sakta hai. But as a matter of fact, you did! This will happen mostly in counting problems (Numbers). Even if you had 100 in English in 10 and 12 you will still come to know that you had been using some Grammar rule incorrectly or there is some exception you had no clue about. But, after a -4 you will remember them! You will sometimes come to know that a certain word which you have been using all your life can also be used in a totally different context. Thank You without an exclamation mark? Sarcasm! Oxymoron, alliteration, etc. Learn what these mean. Such mistakes will make sure you remember all these. Sometimes you will take the diameter as the radius and solve. Sometimes 2*3 will become 5 and sometimes 7*19 will become 114. Don’t rush through problems. The paper is set so as to give you enough time. Slow and steady wins the race.Then another section in the results shows the % of people who attempted a question and % of people who got it right. You are supposed to attempt the easy ones first, then the average difficulty questions. Finally attempt a few difficult ones or totally leave them out. Here you can check which questions you were supposed to attempt but didn’t. Also the questions which you were supposed to leave but being the Bond that you are, you nonetheless decided to attempt it thereby losing marks and giving others a chance to overtake you. If your family is worth billions of dollars, you could do that, but given that you are still reading this, I doubt it! So whenever you look at such questions, try to think about what was in your mind during the mock which made you do such a thing. Try not to commit the same mistake again.Yes, I agree all this will take more than 3 hours. Who told you getting into a good B-school was easy?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?The study material from the top 3 institutes namely Time, CL and IMS is mostly the same. I have seen and used it, so use whichever you want, it won’t make a big difference. A few new ones like Hitbullseye and test funda are also coming up. Haven’t used the material by these 2 so can’t comment. In terms of content the level of questions is higher in Time. I mean tougher questions here, so you are better prepared for CAT, but then you could also argue about why put in more effort than required. In CL, the theory and explanations for quant is way better that that in others. Theory for quant is literally non-existent in Time. IMS is good for verbal. As mentioned above, please use that book for LR and also that book for Verbal. I have not mentioned the names of the books, because if you scroll up and check you will then remember the name when you have to tell it to the shopkeeper! That LR book will help make a strong base for you and then completing the LR material from these institutes will give you practise and improve your skills further. For those who keep talking about Arun Sharma, please please please use proper material. Do you really think 1 book is good enough for your CAT preparation and others are stupid who go through all that? If you think you are smart enough and don’t need all that and 1 book is enough. Good Luck with CAT!Mocks basically tell you where you stand when compared to the toppers in the country. Time has the most no of people attempting its Aimcats. So having that is a must. Next in line, with the maximum no of people attempting the mocks would be CL. After that you have IMS, test funda and all. Aimcats are pretty tough when compared to actual CAT but are extremely important because it gives you a true picture of where you stand and how much more effort you need to put in. CL mocks are close to the CAT level especially in terms of quant. IMS mocks are close to CAT level in verbal. I would suggest Time + CL/IMS. You can however take all the 3 if you want. Or maybe some other institute’s mock series. It’s mostly about practise.The mock questions are mostly the same. It’s just the values that they keep changing every year. Same with the material. Whether you look at the material of this year or that of 5 years ago, you will realise that it’s mostly the same. So, you are better off buying old material from someone or from a secondhand book store. I have uploaded some mocks and some prep material. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...https://drive.google.com/open?id...I also found some useful material from total gadha. Here’s the link for thathttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...I.) GD-PI-WAT prepFrankly speaking, getting a score is easy. This is the tougher part. This requires more hard work because in here, you will be up against the best in the country. Most of the people attending the interviews will come prepared, so here your odds will be higher. So, please work hard for this. GDPI prep as such should be dealt with in a different question. So, won’t go into the details here, but just an over view of what is expected of you. If you had done the GK and current affairs part as mentioned above, you will be easily able to manage the WAT. You will also have ample of points for speaking in a GD. Similarly questions on current affairs in a PI will also be a piece of cake for you. What remains is the HR part. In here, you have to understand that you can guide the interview and you can force them to ask exactly what you have prepared. But that requires a little thinking. Tell me about yourself is a standard question which is used to initiate an interview. It is mostly followed by your strengths and weaknesses. The main thing here is that you have to try to make a story and link everything that you have done in your life till now with why you want to do an MBA. The interviewers are smart people, they have been doing this for years. They are extremely good at catching liars. So think this through well. This part of your prep needs your utmost dedication and hard work. Prepare your answers properly. It is really tough to explain how to prepare for GD-PI. You will be better off at some institute where someone can guide you individually. However, what I can still do is upload all the GDPI material that I have and share it with you. But do keep one thing in mind, this contains some files on the current affairs of 2015, so that will be of no use for you. The other stuff is pretty much relevant. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...I hope you convert your dream college. May the force be with you!","How ‘NOT’ To prepare for CAT/GMATOne of the most important strategy in CAT/GMAT is to find out the wrong choices to identify the right one. This post is dedicated to “Avoiding Mistakes” strategy.Myth & Mistake-1: Following the Herd. Choosing a help or any coaching because others are choosing itHumans belongs to Animal kingdom. If you have studied Biology, then this point will be easier to understand. In animal kingdom. Weak animals are always in herd but the strong one is solitary or always having small groups. Ever wondered Why??The answer lies in the mentality. A strong animal judges the situation and leads its life based on its experience but a weak animal actions are based upon others. If others are doing it, then it’s wise to do it. You can choose to be a Herd follower or to make your own paths.Never follow the group. A leader never follows. If you will move with a group, you will always be with them. If you will create your paths, then only you can beat others. Adding following lines from Robert Frost to add a dramatic touch:“Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”Myth & Mistake-2: Focusing on absolute number of Successful Candidates rather than Percentage.Most of the Institutes talks about the number of success stories but are silent on how many of their students were unsuccessful. Even their Advertisements talks about total number of students getting Interview call or final admits. But the real numbers are shocking, most of the Institutes have 2-3 % students getting expected result.But the magic is in numbers. Make people follow a Herd and even if 2-3% students are successful, the success numbers become substantial. The problem is that your chances of landing in the unsuccessful students group is 98%, but this data does not bother them because they know how to work upon the “Herd Mentality” of the population. Show them 2% success stories and make them follow a herd.Myth & Mistake-3: The Bigger the Better.I am referring to Class Strength. No teacher can teach a herd. If your batch size is more than 10-12 students, then you are not getting proper attention from a teacher. If the education company is claiming “Customized or Personalized” services, then the class size must be less than 10-12 students.Myth & Mistake-4: Going after a Brand or No.1 education companyAll Branded books are easily available in the market at very low-cost. A student joins any help or coaching to get a personalized teaching experience. A Teacher-Student relation is analogous to a Mother-Child relation. There is nothing called “No. 1 Mother”. Every mother is No. 1 for her Kids and the reason is her personalized attention.Rather than sitting in a large group with “No. 1”, you should aim for a personalized attention (We join any help for their teachers or their course offering).Myth & Mistake-5: Deciding after taking DemosAll Institutes stage their Demos. They are very carefully planned. The teacher is usually the teacher, who will not teach regularly. If anyone says “Book your demo” or guide you to a specific time, then it is staged. The best way is to ask them about their class timings and insist on sitting in the ongoing class. If you feel the focus is on you, then you are at the wrong place.Try to identify honest institutes. Honesty should be a very important deciding factor.Myth & Mistake-6: Choosing Institute which makes “Toppers” or just focuses on “Past Records”Never choose any institute if its marketing is focused on this fundamental. Keep your basics simple. Think what you want from it and focus on its delivery. You are there for education, not to hear its past stories.Institutes focus on this factor to take your attention away from their product. Your focus should only be on their product, their teachers, their teaching methodologies, their course structures, etc.Myth & Mistake-7: Jo Dikhta hai, Wo (Nahi) Bikta haiA good product needs no marketing. Weak products need marketing. Whenever you see lots of marketing effort, Google ads, ATL or BTL, it proves that the product is weak. Strong product does not need for all these advertisements. In the marketing world, out of 4Ps, the product is supreme. Focus on “Product”.Myth & Mistake-8: Marketing Gimmick-CAT/GMAT Toppers as TeachersThis is the most commonly used marketing tool, which has a flawed assumption. Now I am talking more of “Critical Reasoning” language. The flawed assumption is “All Toppers are good Teachers”. Teaching needs a very different skill set. The teaching is to impart knowledge; all toppers cannot be good teachers and all good teachers cannot be toppers.Myth & Mistake-9: Institutes offering Patented Techniques or “Tips & Tricks”All tests require “Hard Work”. If someone can patent “Hard-work”, then this “Gimmick” should be accepted. “Tips & Tricks” are developed with your hard-work. Shortcuts should be evolved and should never be learnt from someone else. Particularly for CAT/GMAT, which is more of an IQ test, “Techniques, Tips & Tricks” should be evolved.Myth & Mistake-10: CAT/GMAT will take me to HarvardThis point is more applicable to business schools taking GMAT as a screening tool.The student’s full profile will work. The CAT/GMAT is a one small part of the profile. Look at all business schools as a family, no family will allow you to be their part till the time they see their values or virtues in you. Every Business school has a distinct positioning and your profile should be positioned in the same way. Profile building is the main work and every person should concentrate on.Myth & Mistake-11: Adopting Toppers StrategiesHear everyone, but adopt none. Every person develops his own ways depending upon his Strengths & Weaknesses or as per his conditions. Good for someone may not be good for you. Hear everyone, but adopt only wisely.Myth & Mistake-12: Practice-More the merrierPractice Better, Not More. The practice should have a direction, running in circles will not help. Do Tests and review. Keep error Logs and keep on practicing. Practice wisely, so that every time you move, you should learn from your past mistakes. Do not overdo the tests.Myth & Mistake-13: Teachers will make me a TopperTeachers show us directions. Unless you practice the topics taught in the class, it will not work. I saw many students thinking that if they spend more time in classes, it will help.Myth & Mistake-14: All tests just needs lot of studying, no need to focus on healthHealthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. I see many students not focusing on their health during exams. Many of the studious people have unhealthy bodies. You need to balance life with at least 7-8 hours’ sleep.Myth & Mistake-15: I do not need any peer groupYou learn more from peers than the teachers. The most important factor will be jealousy. Competition in the group brings the best out of you. I was very fortunate that all others in my group were good. They have already scored more than 700 in prep tests. Every test was like a world war where every one of us wanted to beat everyone else in the group.Myth & Mistake-16: I will study and practice from lot of free materials on netBeware of free materials. There is no free lunch. Some free materials are good, but most of it is crap. The real test is different from the Free tests you see on the net. You will be caught off-guard if you are preparing from the net material.Myth & Mistake-17: Beware from 30-day toppers, 15-day toppersThis is the most common way of advertisement. Become a topper in 30 days or 15 days. It’s hilarious. This is a perfect example of fraud marketing. The CAT/GMAT is an IQ test. Only Asterix magic potion can do it and nothing else.Myth & Mistake-18: You can deceive GMAT Computer Adaptive AlgorithmPlease do not try. GMAC has evolved a test which cannot be deceived. Every question can carry you “Up” and throw you “Down”. Each question is important and has the same value as others do.One more myth is when a student believes that difficult questions carry more marks. And easy questions weightage is low. Do not read too much into any strategy. Work hard and it will show.One more mistake is trying to gauge your performance by counting correct questions out of total. This is the reason why the GMAC computer algorithm is difficult to copy.If you see easy questions, you are not doomed. It does not necessarily mean that your test is not going well.Myth & Mistake-19: Quantitative is important, Engineers have an advantageEngineers do not have any advantage in this test. Rather, they are at a disadvantage because their strength (Quant.) does not have substantial weightage. I have seen many students crossing 700 with 40 in quant and Q40 can be achieved by more than 80% of the test givers.Myth & Mistake-20: I am good in English, verbal will be kids playVerbal is not English, verbal is all about IQ. The only portion of the grammar it touches is SC. But the way CAT/GMAT tests your grammar is more based on IQ rather than grammar rules. SC is more about identifying the wrong choices rather than the correct one. It depends upon how easily you can see 2-3 splits and apply logic to find the correct answer.In CAT/GMAT, there is no perfect answer, you must mark the “Most” correct answer. There might not be any perfect answer in the five choices.Your choices should be based on your experience and how a help will help you cover your shortcomings. I found EduShastra customized approach much better than others. I also found their teachers dedicated to their students.","I'll tell you step by step how you should study to get 99.9 percentile in CAT,now you have around say 11 months to prepare. so CAT exam typically comprises of1.

CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam.

I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,Is the CAT a tough exam?,https://www.quora.com//Is-the-CAT-a-tough-exam,Common Admission Test (CAT),58,"Okay. I am going to post a different reply here. By ‘different’ I mean its not the usual success story that you commonly see from CAT toppers where they have cracked the exam within 2 attempts with just under 6 months of preparation.You have many websites for those success stories - GPkafunda.com, Careers 360 and MBA UNiverse. Websites like these post only the story of the toppers. You hardly get to hear the other side of the story if you follow only what they have to say. And why not?. If they start doing so, then their market would vanish overnight.I am going to follow the words of our late President APJ Abdul Kalam-“Dont read success stories, you get only the message. Read failure stories, you get ideas to success”and going to give a more realistic picture of this exam.As a person who has been bitten by this exam 4 times- I feel I have to give out my opinion when I saw this question come up in my feed.The straight answer to this question is- YES. CAT is tough. But the word ‘tough’ has got nothing to do with the content or the syllabus or the preparation.CAT- being a competitive exam, suffers from the same three shortcomings that almost all other competitive exams in India( like GATE, IBPS, IITJEE, AIEEE, UPSC) suffer from- competition, reservation and irrational admission criteria.Its important to know about these three things before you attempt this test.Heavy competition: About 2 lakh people on an average give CAT every year. And guess how many seats are there in all IIMs put together?. Just 4000. Is it not fair to say that the odds are always stacked up against you?. This is one factor which will always bring you down. You can think that you are well prepared. But there will be atleast 20 people who are probably more well prepared than you. This is not unique to CAT, but its unique to any government level entrance exam in India.Reservation: Now, dont get me wrong. I know its there because of social justice and all. And I am not asking anyone to cite reservation as an excuse in case you fail. But, even an SC student will find it difficult to an extent as the cut-off for the top IIMs would still be >90 percentile. You can check it here- http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/users....Admission criteria: A lot of B-schools look at your 10th , 12th scores as a pre-requisite. This is very unfair- IMO. Because you may not have performed well in your 10th Boards due to a variety of reasons. For example- my grand-dad died just 2 days before my 12th Board exams were to start. It was a painful experience for me as he was quite close. As a result- I could not concentrate much. Luckily I managed to score 93% overall aggregate. And my brother had developed a sudden viral fever during his 10th Boards. He could not concentrate for the first few days.Apart from these three factors, there is one which is unique to CAT- the normalization process. This used to be a big deal till CAT 2013. Since there are multiple slots, there is a possibility that one slot might have had a relatively easier question set compared to others. Thus the scores of the easier slots are normalized to a scaled standardized score out of 450 and then you are ranked based on that. And how this normalization is done- remains a million dollar question.And none of these factors are under your control. How is your 10th performance supposed to be a deciding factor in your selection?. Your social circumstances could have been different. Your level of schooling would have been different, your guidance and financial status would have been different. All these are NOT taken into account by the top IIMs.Point is- to eliminate the heavy competition, B- schools use these tricks as a means of filtering out students.Now coming to the much hyped ‘difficulty level’ of CAT. I think that this is probably where most success stories you hear from toppers are centered around. The actual syllabus is just elementary maths and English. And its not that difficult to solve these questions once you remove the three factors I mentioned above.I tried a simple experiment. I gave some 10 questions from one of the previous AIMCAT papers to the son of my next-door-neighbour, who is studying in Class 11. He solved all 10 of them correctly within 15 mins!!.And AIMCAT is regarded as one of the toughest CAT prep series conducted by TIME.Why was he able to solve when most of us cant?. Because he is in touch with the syllabus, when most of us are not. Thats the key ingredient you must know.There are three sections in CAT according to the latest 2015 pattern.SECTION- 1: VERBAL ABILITY and READING COMPREHENSIONThis contains a lot of commie level type of passages. The kind you commonly find in editorials of newspapers like the Economic Times, NYT and the Hindu. Most of them would be centered around some topics like - economics, art history, Greek literature, language and semantics, ancient civilizations etc… Atmost 70- 80% of the passages are from these areas. You can read newspapers editorials to get the hang of it. Or else you can try Arts & Letters Daily .SECTION- 2: LOGICAL REASONING and DATA INTERPRETATIONI just hate this section- to tell you the truth. I mean all these complex kinds of bar-graphs and pie-charts , the amount of mind-boggling data you have to process manually. I find this section the most irrelevant. In my experience of the real world- there are scientific calculators and any chart can be easily computed today using Microsoft Excel formulae. Thats how its being done in most organizations. I really feel that this section should be done away with- or atleast we can give a reduced weightage.But what I really like about this section is that its fun. Total fun when you remove the time constraint. And the next best thing is that you need not require any knowledge on complex formula- like you have to remember for Quant related topics. All you have to do is to understand the data given and correlate the various graphs. Most of the questions in this section could be solved when you tabulate all the data in a single table or a single graph.SECTION-3: QUANTITATIVE ABILITY:Probably the most easiest of all. Some may be surprised at this, because they are most likely to have forgotten what they have learnt in their 10th and 12th Maths. But the NCERT books can really be a good foundation with which you can attempt this section. Questions asked are from the following areas.Geometry and Mensuration- Questions on circles, triangles, polygons and properties.Permutation and Probability- Selection, arrangements.Number Theory- Remainder Theorem, Factor theorem.Progressions- AP, GP, HP, Number series.Algebra- equations, functions and graphs.Business Maths- Profit and Loss, SI& CI, RPVs etc…Most of these topics can be found in NCERT text books or you can even refer your old Maths book- if you still have it. Once you have written all the basic formula in a paper, you can easily tabulate them accordingly as to when you should apply which formula.Once this is done- you can solve a lot of sectional tests Probably the most important step. Most are available for free- if you are going with self-study.Or you can enroll in one the coaching centers and take them too- this is the best course for first-timers.But even after doing all this- you have to be prepared for the worst. Like I said before- if you think you are prepared, there are atleast 20 more people who are more well-prepared than you.The difference between the absolute raw scores( not scaled scores) of a 90 percentiler and a 100 percentiler might not be much( most probably a difference of 50–70 marks, going by what I used to analyze with my mock scores). And percentile ranking is flawed to an extent. Its a ranking system - just a relative score and not an absolute way to judge your talent.In summary: Yes, CAT is tough and unique- in its own respect. It has got its own share of flaws too. Its foolish to compare it with JEE/GATE and say that its easier. Its like comparing apples with oranges.","CAT isn’t difficult at all . It is an exam which tests your coolness and decision making power. CAT is all about choosing the right question and leaving a question if it takes much time of yours(Only by constant practice,u can increase the speed and choose the right question).And you should also understand that the colleges doesn’t consider your score and they consider your percentile only. The main reason for failure in cat is the “aspirants ego”(Don’t mistake me guys).Because we test takers, when we did not get the solution for an easy question, we get tensed and try to solve that question, which may eat up our valuable minutes.Strategy to be followed acc. to my point of view:If u r strong in basics then ok; else clear your basics of q,v,r in a month or two(one month is actually enough).Then start solving aimcat test series(Note: Need not solve all qns in ur course books; start aimcat asap)Understand the concepts from course books and then start solving the aimcat series from January itself(THIS IS IMPORTANT: pls pls start aimcat from jan itself; even if u dint complete ur course books).And don’t ever skip any aimcat. Taking aimcat is important but the more imp. thing is reviewing your aimcat papers thoroughly before giving your next aimcat .Reviewing is not all about understanding the “no idea” qns alone. It’s about finding the shortcuts for each qns and sticking to the fastest way of solving the qns. And it’s also important to read the newspapers daily in order to improve ur vocabulary, reading speed(words per min needs to be increased drastically).It helps a lot in GD too.","No.Cracking CAT is not tough. CAT is an aptitude test. You need to be in high spirits built with good practice. That is the key.Lots of people take the CAT prep too hard on themselves, this ain’t fair. Reason: CAT is an aptitude exam, you can do awesome on your day! It is not a syllabus coverage based exam. It is about solving the questions you know well -an exam of calm mind - selection of easy to moderate questions and solving them!But, the other side is also not cool - you should not just do nothing or do bits and pieces.What I advice my students is to practice hard till a month before CAT and then relax a month before CAT - only do basic revision and give a few mocks. Keep your calm in the final month. Aptitude, once built, stays for long. So practice and then relax and enter CAT.Load nahi lene ka guys!Best wishesRahul SirFollow my CAT prep group on: CAT Prep with IIM A alumni","Is CAT exam really tough? It just might be and at the same time, it might not be. How? Simple, not all humans are same and not everyone have same logical and metal aptitude. Not everyone is preparing the same way you are, Not everyone have been disciplined enough to prepare, Not everyone have their basics clear or have a good vocabulary skills.It is up to you to decide where to land and where do you want to see yourself. Lets take a quick peek at what CAT is,Quant 1.Basic Quant: 12 to 14 questions, This section accounts for Maths that we learn in our 6–9th grades. These contain basic topics like percentages Profit/Loss and what not. Now it depends for person to person on how much time allocation needs to be. Books like Rd Sharma are enough for this section.2.Data Interpretation: 15 to 17 questions, This section is all about reading charts and graphs and analysing the data given , and hence it does not require much practisce until you are like a year to give your exam3.Data Sufficiency : 2 to 3 questions4.Geometry and Algebra : 17 to 18 questions: This is a slightly more tougher topic and you will need some certain professional help in order to master this part of the paper. I would highly recommend you buy correspondence packs of institutions like TIME etc.Verbal 1.Reading Comprehensions: 15 to 17 questions: To improve this part one must read read an dread. There is no shortcut to master RC’s. It is preferable that you read 500–600 passages as part of the preparation as that is the idle size of an RC expected in the paper itself. As you will read for days you will notice that your reading time per passage is decreasing and you will slowly learn the way of speed reading.2. Logical Reasoning: 15 to 17 Questions: These questions are very basic conceptual based algorithms which you have already prbably done in many Olympiads and stuff, no extra practice must go into it if you have a high aptitude.3. Paragraph Completion/Sentence Rearrangement/ Sentence elimination: 3 questions: This involves deep knowledge of grammar and hence I would recommend you to go through the book called Wren and Martin. Grammar will take time to improve and dont stop your practice once you think that you are thorough enough instead keep practicing this till the last day.4.Text Completion/Word Usage:3 questions: For this high vocab skill set is required and I would recommend you to use Word Power Made easy by Norman Lewis, which has application and roots of many words which will not only help you in your CAT but also in GRE GMAT and what not. An app called VoLT (Vocabulary Learning Technique) is also there which is really helpful as it has pictorial representation of words and really large word list for that matter . Do check it out I found it very helpful.Follow the lead given up here and you be just fine, again all I can comment upon is based on what an average person and candidate would prepare for. Maybe you have a very good base of Maths have been speaking English for the most part of your life, then its a complete different scenario.So keep calm and prepare, No need to be scared. Trust on yourself that YES, you have prepared the best way possible and you will be just fine."

CAT,How much percentile will a raw score of 105-110 in CAT fetch?,https://www.quora.com//How-much-percentile-will-a-raw-score-of-105-110-in-CAT-fetch,"CAT (Common Admission Test) 2016, Exam and Test Results, Common Admission Test Percentiles, Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",7,"Between 85–90 %ileFor a much more detailed analysis and year-on-year comparison, you can have a look at the data given here: Score vs Percentile Mapping for CAT Exam - 2017, 2016, 2015","Hi,Firstly, let me start by saying that estimating percentiles at this stage is very dicey - given that we do not have access to the actual paper and the actual performances of students in the paper - most of the coaching institutes and experts will be basing their prediction on the inputs received from the various test-takers as well as experts who themselves take the test. So, do take all the estimations with a pinch of salt(or maybe more).Right now, the expected percentile should only help you decide on colleges that have application dates before the actual CAT results. So work with a buffer of +/- 5%ile while making these decisions.My estimate: IBased on the premise that CAT 2016 was slightly more difficult than CAT 2015, I would expect someone with a raw score of 105–110 to score around 90 percentile. Find below a percentile-score mapper that is based on my interactions with students and experts:Hope this helps.All the best!VKIMS VKpedia",You can assume it between 83–87 percentile based on past data.I had written CAT’15. My score was 126. It had been converted into approximately 89 percentile.Based on difficulty level it can be changed. I have written CAT this year also. I found the difficulty level same as of the last year.You can’t be certain regarding the percentile but you can have broader idea based on this.,"As per last 2 years,at raw score of 105–110 you will easily fetch around 85 %tile but since this time (CAT-2016), paper was relatively difficult(especially DILR section) so i would say.. this time raw score of 110 would fetch you around 90%tile.and last but not least,since second slot was relatively difficult(DILR&QA) so scaled score can depict very different picture so better to wait few more week.and hope for the best!"
CAT,How do I score 102 percentile in CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-score-102-percentile-in-CAT,"Exam and Test Results, Common Admission Test Percentiles, Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",10,"Just for asking such a question, I suggest that you DO NOT attempt to write CAT.To clarify, he is an example. There are 20 people writing an exam. You got the 5th highest marks. So, there are 80% of people whose marks are below yours. Therefore, you have a percentile of 80. Lets say that you score the highest marks of the 20, your percentile would be 100. (in theory the 0th percentile falls at negative infinity and the 100th percentile at positive infinity, although in many practical applications, such as test results, natural lower and/or upper limits are enforced.)So, when you say 102 percentile, practically and theoretically, it doesn’t seem feasible.",Possible Condition to score 102%ile in CAT:-1.Attempt cat multiple no of times and start adding all your percentile till it becomes 102.2.Drop a mail to Mr.Neeraj Dwivedi(CAT Conveyor 2017) and ask him to give the percentile you are thinking about.3.Start believing that miracle is going to happen this year and your percentile like 10.20 shows 102.00%ile to you (Could be possible if the person who is feeding data makes a error).Your Question is a hypothetical which needs a answer like this but I am sorry my dear friend it doesn't suits in any of the condition.P.S:- Your question is good for quantitive Aptitude like what is the possible Value of error if 102 percentile is awarded in cat examination while the maximum percentile awarded should be 100?A.0B.0C.0D.0Period!!,"This is only an expectation scoring 102 Marks in CAT Exam because as it is having only 100 Marks. So out of 100 we can score maximum 100 marks not much more than 100. So we only say it as expectation or in daily routine scenario where we put not 100 I am 101% sure, we simple say we are talking about 100%So here 102 means 100 % marks in CAT Exam.The very important thing you need to keep in your mind i.e. concentration over your preparation.The second important thing is that keep CAT Exam in your priority list, once it will be come in your priorityOnly think that you have to clear any how and any situation CAT exam this year, because if in your mind either have or not that if this year you can not clear it then will try better next year.Always to make a proper time table for preparation. The preparation plan according to your schedule try to make it according to you. Don’t make a plan which you have not able to follow.Once you make the plan then you need to review your syllabus. As there is not any prescribed syllabus for CAT Exam but as per the past year trends various IIMs create a common syllabus for examination.Once you review the syllabus need to figure out that which are your strong areas and which are the weak areas. The topics where are strong or the topics where you are weak.Try to remove your weak areas.Prepare a daily plan and monthly plan.Follow these plan.Try to finish your goal on time which will motivates you towards your new goalsTry to make plan for each and every section.For quantitative section you need to prepare more and more topics or problem.For data interpretation is scoring subjects need to solve more and more questions.For verbal ability need more and more reading and reading news papers and need to learn new words.For logical reasoning this is the section which wants more and more practice of puzzles and you need to build basics and make strong your reasoning and analytical skills.Try to attempt mock test to evaluate your preparation. It will give you a sample idea about the difficulty level of question papers.Try to solve more and more previous year question papers.On examination day reach 30 minutes before in the examination hall and try to solve easy question first and tough and average question in after the easy question.Try to analyse your preparation every day by solving a set of sample papers.Revision is the most important thing for preparation.Try to manage your time. Time management is the most important things for preparation.All the very Best!!!!!!",I think you are living on a gola with some different base number.Probably 102 there equates to 100 or 99.9 in decimal base on this gola.
CAT,Can an average student crack CAT?,https://www.quora.com//Can-an-average-student-crack-CAT,"Average Student, Exam and Test Preparation Advice, CAT Preparation, Exam Strategies, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",87,"Let me introduce myself. I consider myself an average student. I went to IIT (just got in, to be precise). I took CAT 4 times. I managed 99+ twice in CAT, without any coaching. My lowest sectional score was 75 percentile. With some efforts, I managed well above 99 percentile in that section in my last attempt. I have had interview calls from all IIMs except Bangalore. (No, I did not go to IIM for an MBA). Answer in short : Yes. You can.  But, Work hardLong Answer: Firstly, I presume you want to get admission in an IIM. For that, clearing CAT will not suffice. Believe me, I got rejected in half a dozen interviews and I know 100 percentilers rejected by IIM. Clearing CAT: As you would know, there are three sections in CAT exam. Prepare for all of them. The Quant section was easy last time. This essentially means that if you solve hundreds of questions beforehand and remember all the formulas, this section will be a cakewalk for you. So, buy a question bank. Career Launcher  had online subscriptions. Check those out. [A risky advice: I think the expected score of randomly guessing answers for all questions with negative marks is 0. So, if you can eliminate a choice or two, your expected marks by guessing the answer is positive. I strongly suggest you to learn to eliminate choices. Eg: for a probability question involving 2 dice, the answer will most likely have denominators  - 36,18,12,9, etc. It is very unlikely for the answer to have 17 or 19 or 13 in the denominator.]The DI section is relatively tougher. Again, with practice, this can be mastered. Get books with tough problems, like Arun Sharma. [For questions involving seating arrangement, attribute matching etc, the options in the following questions may give strong hints which may be helpful to derive the arrangement. Learn to use those. I strongly urge not to guess blindly for line graphs or bar charts. If you must mark without real calculation, stare at the graph for 3-4 seconds before marking the answer]Same goes for the verbal part. Practice. Last time, there were only sentence arrangement and reading comprehensions. So, start reading. And start writing.  Read quality articles. The Hindu editorials may be a great place to start. Else, google for project-syndicate. Increase your speed at which you read (comprehend). Don't worry, I do not have a great reading speed. Increase your vocabulary. Start thinking in English. Start talking in English. Meanwhile, perfect your grammar. I have heard that TIME material is the best. Get access to that. Beg, Borrow or Steal. Join mock test series. www.hitbullseye.com has some awesome free material. (This is the only coaching which I had). You can get a lot of GMAT material online. Install a vocabulary building app in your phone. To increase your speed, install apps in your phone - brain wars, Lumosity etc. Do not go for the paid versions. Practice everyday for half an hour. The pace at which your brain fires will go up drastically. Practice. Be honest to your plans. Be systematic. You will clear CAT with 99+ percentile. Now, as said earlier, CAT score alone will not get you an admission. Make a good profile. You should be prepared for the interview - Why MBA? Why this IIM? What value addition can you bring to the class? Strengths? Weaknesses? Regrets in life? Short term and medium term goals? Current affairs? Make a great profile. One which stands out. Do one or two relevant specialization in Coursea (they give free certificates, if you meet their criteria) if your academics are not great.  Tell them you know VBA and python. Work for an NGO (this got me a job offer which I had to decline). Learn a foreign language. Do a project which sounds great or which has significance for everyday life. Listen to and learn a course from open course  website which is relevant for MBA (Like microeconomics from MIT or Game Theory from Yale or OR from NPTEL). Have a hobby. (not solving puzzles alone please. Half the people appearing for the interview claim that they can solve puzzles). Learn to talk well (with varying modulation and accepted pace of speech). Dress well for the interview(believe me, at least 20% of the guys whom I met at the interviews were not dressed properly). Smile. Perfect your body language. Make the interview a discussion and not Q&A. May the force be with you. ","Yes, definitely. CAT is totally a different exam. The topics are very general and to crack CAT, you just need good preparation and a strategy for individual sections and then its very easy to clear CAT with 99 percentile.Being an average student does not affect your percentile and therefore should not affect your preparation.If you are dreaming to crack CAT with good score you need a plan of how to start and to finish of this race leading yourself on the top.CAT is the most familiar MBA entrance test. Every year more than 1.5 students registers for CAT but only few of them crack it with 100%ile and get the chance to enter in one of the prestige institutions like IIMs, FMS, ISB etc.Now the question is HOW TO CRACK THE EXAM?CAT includes 3 sections:VERBAL ABILITY – 34 Questions (60 minutes)DATA INTERPRETATIONAND LOGICAL REASONING – 32 Questions (60 minutes)QUANTITATIVE ABILITY – 34 Questions (60 minutes)Plus one mark on every right answer and minus one-third marks on every wrong answer.To crack the exam with 100% you must follow a simplified approach for your preparation. Here are some tips that will definitely lead you to score good.So firstly divide the three sections and put emphasis on each one according to your comfortability with the section.PART 1: VERBAL ABILITY: The verbal section in CAT not only tests the Grammar and English of a candidate but also the critical thinking skills. Since the last 3 years, VA-RC is one section in which candidates have particularly faced difficulty. In this post, we give you a guide on how to approach Reading Comprehension in the Verbal Section and the pattern for the section in CAT 2018DISTRIBUTION OF QUESTIONS:6-7 questions on error correction5-6 questions on jumbled paragraphs4-5 questions on facts, inference or judgment3-4 questions on para summary15-16 questions on reading comprehensionPART 2: DATA INTERPRETATION AND LOGICAL REASONING:1. Quick Calculations and approximations– This is specifically true for DI section. Be sure to do as much as mental calculations as possible and memorize things like squares, cubes, roots, fractions and percentage conversions. You can use approximations up to 1% in your calculations as the options in CAT are general varied by at least 3%. For ex, you can use 3 instead of 3.453 to speed up calculations.2. Focus on keywords: There are a few keywords that can completely change the meaning of a statement. Some words that should be paid attention to are: all, some, none, other than, only, unless, if and only if, and some prefixes like non-, un-, dis- etc3. DIAGRAMMATICAL APPROACH: You should organise the information in a systematic manner by using tables, symbols and diagrams. This minimises the work involved and helps you solve a different set of questions based on one main problem. The symbols used should be such that they convey the proper meaning to you as given in the question4. Don’t get stuck in a Question: It is quite possible that while scanning, you choose a data set that looked simpler, but while solving, it turned out to be tough or highly calculation-intensive. You should detach yourself from the data set as soon as you find it very tough or time-consuming, even if you have invested time in it.5. Use Options – Be sure to look at the options before you start solving the questions. It will help you eliminate some of the variables which are not a part of the options and, more often than not, includes clues which will help you solve the answer in less duration.PART 3: QUANTITATIVE ABILITY:When you start preparing for quants and start progressing through topics, it is advised to have a personal formula bank with yourself. There are always more than 1 way to write a formula, keep the formula bank handy with the the formulas that suit you the bestA lot of times, rather than solving questions, it’s possible to get the answer by plugging in the values given in the options than working out from the actual algorithm.There are a number of tricks for speed maths. Go through these as they are really handyWhile practicing problems, identify your weak areas and keep a track if there has been some progress in the topics. If the mistakes are recurring then evaluate on WHY this is happening. It might be a case of a conceptual gap rather than a question-to-question mistake.When you are done with individual section preparation, move to mocks and try giving as many tests as you can. Here are some tips to that:PREPARATION:1. Mocks: In every mock, always aim to solve at least 50% of the test in the stipulated time. This allows you to give ample amount of time for each set and improve accuracy.2. Fixing approach for different types of questions: There is a limit to the sets that can be made. Exposure to variety, traps, and fixed approaches to problems will help you do well in the section. Also, focus on the thought process.3. Practice: Along with your preparation for QA and VA, be sure to devote at least 1-1.5 hours and solve 2 sets of LR and DI each. Be sure to experiment with different approaches to discover the one that suits you the best.LR & DI COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE FOR CAT 2018How to Prepare for Quantitative Aptitude to crack CAT 2018 - MBA PreparationGo through this plan and you will definitely crack CAT 2018.Also, here are some tips and tricks which you should follow while preparing for CAT.Tip 1. Take mock tests in an online environmentYou must take computer-based mock CAT so that you are familiar with the actual test environment. Start taking the mock CAT as they will make you feel in the real environment and completely help you to prepare and save any wastage and you will be able to learn many tricks of how to solve the questions, which type of questions to be opt first.Tip 2. Analysis and Evaluation is mandatoryAfter every CAT mock test, you must analyse your performance and evaluate your scoring areas based on CAT exam pattern.Shiv Raj an IIM CALCUTTA student and 99.94 percentiler in CAT shares, ""Whenever you take a mock test, assess not only the wrong questions but also the right ones. Sometimes you may score very high, while on other occasions you might get a low score.Tip 3. Find your strength and weaknessTo prepare for CAT 2018, it is very importance to identify your strengths and weaknesses. Going by your own evaluation, you must focus on your strong areas and start working on that. As most of the questions in CAT are based on the application of basic concepts such as linear equation, probability, permutation and combination,(in quant), learning both concepts and application of all the topics at this stage is not advisable if you are aiming to crack CAT 2018.Tip 4. Practice, Practice and PracticeCAT Experts suggest that you must practice a lot so that you can make an instant connect with the question during your CAT exam day. Regular practice in a right direction will not only help increase your question-solving speed but also make you habitual to sit for three hours.CHHAVI GUPTA, one of the two female CAT 2017 toppers who secured 100 percentile mentions, ""I rigorously practised the Mock CAT series, selected some random tests online and sample CAT. To be precise, I solved 35 practice tests and analysing them critically.""Tip 5. Set your TargetsCAT pattern is always similar to its previous one and CAT 2018 is expected to be like 2017. So candidates should do SMARTWORK and focus on targeting the minimum and maximum number of questions that you will be attempting during CAT 2018. Around 20 questions in each the sections can take you to around 98 or 99 percentile in CAT but you should be open up in those sections which are your strengths.Mayank Raj, 100 percentiler, CAT 2017 shares that he had attempted all questions from Quantitative Ability as it was his strength area accurately followed by DI & LR and VARC.Tip 6. Time managementWith 60 minutes allotted for each section during your CAT test duration, you should first attempt the questions which you can solve quickly. If you are doubtful on a question at the first glance, you leave it in the first round and come back to it in sequence after you have completed the first round of attempts. As you quickly solve a few questions, it will inculcate a higher level of confidence to attempt the difficult questions during the second round of attempts. Sharing his section wise time management strategy regarding how to prepare for CAT 2018,Madhur Gupta, CAT 2017 100 percentiler says, ""In DILR, I focussed on question wise approach. Did the easier questions of the set and marked the tough ones of later consideration. In this was completed five sets and later came back to the tougher questions. I found this very convenient. Quant and verbal sections were too easy for any strategy. You either knew the answers or didn't know them.""Tip 7. Accuracy is very importantPrioritizing the questions is becoming one of the key areas to success. As you go on attempting questions during your CAT, make sure that you compromise very little on accuracy, as there is negative marking on each wrong attempt,so you have to be very cautious and very confident while answering any question.Nikhil Singh, IIM Shillong PGP 2017-19 batch student says “ My basic strategy was to attempt as many questions as possible. Even though there was a slight compromise with the strategy but it ended up attempting 90% questions with around 70 percent accuracy.,”Tip 8. Leave the questionsIn case you find questions a little difficult during the second round of your attempt, and are not sure about the answer, try to leave it. But yes, sometimes you can find the answer by analysing the options. So this strategy can also be followed.Sai Praneeth Reddy, another 100 percetiler of CAT 2017 mentions, ""I started with DILR but I found that first few questions were really tough and time-taking. So, I skipped first four questions. Gradually, I realised that skipping questions won’t lead me anywhere. Then I started from the last question and started solving followed by whatever I could answer first.""Tip 9. Relax and BE focused at your D-dayYou should prepare well before your date with CAT. Spend a day before the test in a stress-free environment. You should meet your friends and relax the way you like.Once you enter the test centre keep yourself focused on the test and maintain calm.Pranit Arora, who secured 100 percentile in CAT 2015 says, “It is important to stay relaxed and not get nervous for the test. Stress leads to failure which must be avoided. So do not overthink, stay calm and confident.”Before the exam day, it is extremely important to keep your cool and rest properly.”Focus on maximising the number of attempts with high accuracy. Leave the rest on to your honest effort.For preparing CAT 2018, You can join the course EckovationThis course includes concept videos, mock test with good material. It will really benefit you.For more information on - MBA Preparation How to prepare for CAT 2018 in less than 6 months? - MBA PreparationHope it help you.All The Best:)","YES.How?Mental power is more important than intellectual strength in respect to cracking CAT. When you are psychically strong, you will be ready to make any challenging moves. If you are low in believing that you can, then you can never make it happen. Eternally remember the competition should be with you not with the world. When you compete with yourself you explore yourself and develop your abilities. This certainly drives to success and credits to your hard work.CAT:The word itself brings so much of heaviness (although C means Common!) and one starts suspecting if he can or not. A student cracking CAT with 100% is a genius holding in himself and making an effort beyond the limits (rest is history). So, motivate yourself well enough that you work remarkably hard which makes you proud.Here comes a question again, I have seen many students working hard spending a year or two but they don’t make the way to IIM. What now? Aren’t they sincere and hardworking? Thomas Alva Edison before making a bulb failed more than 100 times! But that doesn’t mean he wasn’t doing the right hard work. It is just that our life seems short to take CAT more than 4 times because there is a lot in life to do. You can obviously use that sharpened brain in many other tests and competitions in life.Q: Who is an average student?A: The one who can solve anything but takes time.Q: So, how can he crack CAT?A: By giving time to sharpen his skills.How to prepare for CAT?Planning: Structure a plan that will help you carry on the academic/professional/personal life along with CAT preparation smoothly. As you are the one who takes time in grasping things, so start your preparation early i.e., at least before 6 months.Books: Choose your books wisely. Do not start preparing for a topic from different books. Choose one book and try completing it wholly.Online/offline course: Rely on one course and make use of it entirely. Do not hesitate to ask questions to clear your doubts. If possible be in a group of students always who are preparing for CAT. Spend more time in understanding and solving a difficult question yourself, this will help you explore ideas and learn many ways of solving a question. I would suggest you opt for “Handa Ka Funda” online course, this is an awesome aid for beginners. It's video tutorials are easy to understand and helps in moving fastly to advance level of questions. The doubt clarification classes help you clear your doubts as well as discover additional helpful things.Dedication:Dedicate time to each and every section and never let any subject rest. Always keep revising even the easiest part. Mocks are the heart of CAT preparation. Scrutinize each mock thoroughly to identify your strengths and weaknesses.Hope this helps. All the best!","Let’s understand on who qualifies as an average student in the first place, as I see many students tend to(rather want to) qualify themselves as an average student although they maybe in the top quartile of their graduating batch or school.An average student is somebody who is in the mid range of the graduating batch or board or school,So in if you have scored,10th CBSE/ICSE 60–70% or State Board(like TN/AP, the more generous ones) have scored 70–80%12th 60–70%UG - Engineering - Non IIT/NIT/BITS, Non Tier 1 Govt/Pvt Univ/College like COEP, DTU, NSIT, VIT Univ, SRM Univ.. Arts & Science - Non Top Delhi Univ, Mumbai Univ, Bangalore Univ colleges.. Have scored around 60% but don’t have any arrearsthen you qualify to be the average student.Now if you dwell deeper into why does one become an average student, two things come up,He/She was not really good at acads from the onset, maybe had interests elsewhere like extra-curricular stuff like Music, Movies, Cooking, Sports etcHe/She didn't quite like what he/she was being taught and generally drifted away from being amongst the top performers of the class/batchIf you are the former type of average student, trying to even attempt CAT, and not pursuing the things that you are really really passionate about or good at, you are doing a big mistake. Remember, there are 1.3 Crore students graduating out of various UG programs only 2 Lakh give CAT, and mind you a vast majority of successful people are non MBAs/IIM Grads. You get the ideaIf its the later, then the good news is CAT is an exam that doesn't test most things that they taught you in school or college, at least not the boring parts.CAT tests you on your basics/understanding around Quant, Verbal & Logical Skills and these are absolutely trainable areas with enough time and willingness to prepare hard/right.In my personal experience I have seen numerous students fromTier 2/3 engineering colleges with below average grades,Arts & Science colleges who hated Maths,Vernacular medium who struggled with English during UG,Small town who were never serious about anything in life before wanting to attempt CAT,conquer the CAT and in style. And what connected all of them was their unflinching intent to make it big in life.So it doesn't matter if you are an average student or otherwise, as long as you have the hunger to succeed and make a kickass career for yourself, you can and you will crack CAT, my friend!Hope this helps!All the Best!"

CAT,Which one is better CAT or XAT?,https://www.quora.com//Which-one-is-better-CAT-or-XAT,"Xavier Aptitude Test, Comparisons, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",8,"'BETWEEN CAT and XAT', it is hard to separate which one of them is better, however here are a few contrasts between the two that can/might enable you to choose for yourself.Time Limit for XAT and CATIn XAT there is no time confine, competitors need to endeavor most extreme out of 72 inquiries in the term of 170 minutes. You are permitted to switch between segments in the given time window. While, in CAT, there is the one-hour sectional point of confinement for each area. When as far as possible is finished you don't have the opportunity to switch between the areas.The Focus of XAT and CAT ExamsThe Xavier Aptitude Test concentrates much on dialect abilities and thinking abilities. Hopefuls need great direction over syntax and basic leadership. In CAT, the emphasis is on DILR area which requires broad reasoning to comprehend the riddle based inquiries.Difficulty Level in XAT and CATThe trouble of both the exam is high. The XAT is troublesome because of its Decision Making and Quantitative Aptitude. The paper requires great thinking aptitudes. While, CAT is troublesome because of its Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning Section. This has all the earmarks of being a most difficult segment of the exam.Marking Scheme for XAT and CATIn CAT, there are 3 marks for each right answer and negative stamping of 1 check for each mistaken answer. There is no negative stamping for the Non-MCQ questions.In XAT, there is an extra of imprints for each right and a conclusion of 0.25 imprints for the wrong answer. Additionally, for each unattempted question past 8, there is negative checking of 0.05 imprints.Test Takers for XAT and CATAll in all, the quantity of test takers for the CAT is higher than XAT. A year ago there were 2,31,067 understudies connected for CAT. Though for XAT around 90, 000 hopefuls connected for XAT. The quantity of test takers is less however the opposition is high because of few numbers situates in XLRI when contrasted with aggregate IIM's and different schools.","Thanks for the A2A, firstly. In my opinion, there is no hard and fast rule to choosing one over the other. Ideally, I would suggest targeting the two to an actual serious B-School Aspirant who wishes to land in one among the top B-Schools or the one he/she wishes to join.  If the question meant to be in the light of pattern perspective, XAT, for me, scores higher. It's still a highly respected examination in the country which I feel aptly gauges a potential candidate for their programmes. Though, perspectives do differ. I have had thoroughly enjoyed my XAT preparations and I still love reminiscing. I would surely recommend people take up XAT, who have not been considering for a while. Taking CAT then, is a habit whose scores are widely accepted. One needs to aptly assess the strategies one needs to maul each of these, that are actually individual-centric. Good Luck!","CAT Exam . Common Admission Test (CAT) is a computer based selection test conducted by the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) for their business administration programs.The CAT score is being used by more than 500 institutes for the admission.XAT ,XLRI conducts XAT on behalf of the XAMI. For more than 60 years XLRI is conducting XAT at all India level to select the most appropriate students for management education. The XAT score is being used by more than 150 institutes for the admission.the importance of exam depends on individual level, where which colleges you are targeting to get admission inEngineering Results 2017 :JEE : BITSAT : PET : VITEEE : SRMJEEE : Engineering Entrance Exams","Comparing CAT and XAT is like comparing apples and pears. The reason being both are healthy and have their own nutrient value.CAT is the gateway to the 20 IIMs and other top colleges. XAT is accepted by 11 XAMI member colleges like XLRI and 150 non-XAMI colleges. So both the exams have a very lucrative list if colleges.The difficulty level of both the exams is at-par with each other. Personally, I would say XAT is tougher than CAT. XAT tests a whole lot of other things other than English, quant and logical reasoning. The sections like Decision Making and GK are part of the XAT exam which is unique it.Other than many good colleges like MDI, XAT etc accept both XAT or CAT scores.So if you aspire for only top colleges then both are equally good and you must write both."
CAT,What is the best time to prepare for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-the-best-time-to-prepare-for-CAT,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",100+,"‘The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex, overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, then starting on the first one.’ - Mark TwainYou ask a top company CEO or a budding entrepreneur in the start-up world about the day when they made it big in corporate world. The answer will be “Every day from the point I decided to start working towards my/our goals”.So the right time to start your preparation is the moment when you have decided that you want pursue Management studies from top B-school in India. Just as “Rome was not built in a day”, no successful career in any field was built in a day.CAT Preparation may take 10–12 months for a person with average past academic record, 6–8 months for a person with above average past academic record and 3–4 months for a person with excellent past academic record. But an early starter will surely give you an advantage over the others who are yet to decide on it.Divide the preparation in phases. The reason to divide the preparation in phases is that you need to have clear goals to achieve which shall help you in achieving your next goal.The time dedicated to each of the phases varies from person to person depending on the hard work, time you put in to achieve it. Make a realistic timeline for yourself keeping in mind your college schedule and exams.I will be explaining it with 8 months preparation plan.Phase 1 – First 10 daysDevelop reading SkillsDevelop your reading skills by reading daily newspaper editorials and business news so that you can simultaneously improve your reading speed and knowledge which shall help you during your GD-PI process. Don’t just read newspaper articles, try to understand it and if possible, try getting greater insights of the topic by doing self-research on the internet. This will surely improve your analysing skills, vocabulary and knowledge. This process of developing reading skills should continue not only till your GD-PI but for lifetime.Get clear idea about various MBA entrance Exams and B-schools.PGDM or MBA is not just about CAT and IIM. There are many other institutes which match the levels of IIM i.e. MDI, XLRI, SPJIMR, etc. Have a look at some top B-schools placement analysisMany of the top institutes like NMIMS, SIBM, XLRI conduct their own entrance tests. Go through their batch profile, placement figures, Job offered profile and then decide whether you really want to do PGDM or MBA. It is been observed that many join B-schools only considering the lucrative packages.Phase 2 – Day 11 to Day 100Syllabus for Quant:Syllabus for DI :Syllabus for LR:Syllabus for Verbal:Firstly you need to analyse your aptitude level. Take a Free Mock Test available online. Though it is a tiring process, you will be able to get clear idea about the exam pattern, level of difficulty. It also depends on your understanding of school – level Maths and Verbal concepts.If you scored low (<60%) in these topics in school and it reflects in your Free Mock also, then you would be requiring assistance in your preparation.If you scored average (60%-80%) in these topics in school and had average score in Free Mock, then you can prepare by self by subscribing to various course material provided online and with Mock tests.If you scored more than 80% in these topics in your school and had average score in Free Mock, you are clear on your concepts and you require practice of various types of questions and Mock Tests. If any point of time, you feel you are not confident about your school concepts, I recommend you take assistant from experts for preparation.Once you have figured out your requirements, now start your practice. Considering that you are a college student, devote 1-2 hours daily depending upon the other prior commitments.Make a strict study plan for each day. Also keep weekly dose of entertainment, parties in mind while preparing your schedule. Considering these stuffs makes your plan more realistic and practical to follow. Make sure you strictly adhere to your deadlines because many of the aspirants don’t work seriously on this phase and end up with little time for Mocks.Divide the CAT syllabus into small sections.Track your preparation. Analyse what you practice with data points like Questions solved in the week, Average accuracy of a topic, your strengths and weakness, important formulae and tricks for easy calculation. Log in to PRAQTISE to start your preparation because it is based on adaptive algorithm, it gives analysis of your practice questions, you can create your own customised study plan and track your compliance.Phase 3 – Day 101 to Day 140You should be well versed with the concepts and what you require now is practice. Take sectional tests. Know your strengths and weakness. Work on your weakness because at this time, you will start developing the comfort level with particular sections or topics.Phase 4 – Day 141 to Day 230Simulating the test environment is an important aspect. Start taking mock tests. Analyse your mocks as it will give you clear idea of your strengths and weakness, strategy to attempt a mock, time management.You should try out multiple strategies for improvement and see what works best for you. The best suited strategy should be applied to last 5–6 mocks which will eventually give you confidence to go forward with your strategy in actual CAT.Try to take at least 15 mocks. Don’t give multiple mocks in a day as your brain needs rest and you need time to anaylse your test and work on your weakness and strengths. For more details, have a look here.Phase 5: Last 7 daysDon’t try to solve any new topic or take Mock tests. Suggested thing to do is to revise the formulae and the mocks which you have given. Go through the bookmarked questions.Don’t solve or revise any questions just a day before. Relax your body and brain. Don’t over sleep or do strenuous work. Nothing good will happen, so avoid doing anything bad.Get up fresh on D-Day and calm yourself as a steady mind always gives better result.Good Luck for CAT.","The best time is whenever you decide that you want to crack CAT - once you start, maintain the rhythm. CAT is all about practice.Ideally, it depends on whether you are equally comfortable in Maths and English till 10th class or not. If you are comfortable with both subjects, then you can start 10–12 months before CAT. If you are not very comfortable lets say with any one section - for instance English - you need to spend extra 3–4 months to build command over the subject.The idea is to make sections comparable and then rise up to the CAT level.So, if one section is very weak compared to the other: you need to spend 15–16 months; if both sections are equally good and if really good, then you can do it in 10 months type as well.However, lots of people who have all subjects well covered in high school(class 7 to 10th) crack CAT in 5–7 months as well.So, assess your current status in subjects and accordingly start the preparation.Best of luck!Rahul SirFollow my CAT group on FB: CAT Prep with IIM A alumni","You need to strategize and plan to do well in anything. There a few geniuses out of there who do well in many things without a lot of preparation, but for the rest of us, dedicated planning and hard work can work wonders.CAT preparation involves two stages, a long term strategy and a focused short term strategy.a) Long Term - Improving generic skills: These are good habits/skills to inculcate which will improve the all round personality of a person. Doing better in CAT is a positive side effect. Some of them are given below:Reading Novels: Reading is a very good habit to pick up. It gives you a great perspective of different cultures and time periods which will help you understand the world around you better. With an eye on CAT, start reading as many nonfiction books as possible. Books based on history, philosophy, science, etc will help cultivate an interest in that specific field. This gives you an edge when you are attempting the exam.Solving Sudoku: Having good attention to detail is a great skill to inculcate. Your CAT percentile will improve significantly if you can cut down on ‘silly mistakes’. You should aspire to perform to the best of your abilities and not miss out on any easy questions. Solving Sudokus enhances your attention to detail and concentration power.Playing Chess: Chess is an excellent tool to improve problem solving skills. I improved these skills by playing chess. It is very under rated how much they help in improving your concentration levels.Newspaper habit: Reading newspapers like The Hindu everyday is a great way to enhance vocabulary. People who read newspapers regularly certainly fare better than their peers in Reading comprehension, Para Jumbles and Cloze test. Plus it helps in developing an all round personality that helps in the interview.The sole point of inculcating these habits is not CAT Preparation. These are good habits to develop which have a positive impact on your CAT preparation.b) Short Term - Focused effort: With 5 months left to CAT, the preparation should take on a mission mode and completely focussed on CAT preparation. The chart shown is a reliable strategy used by some successful candidates during CAT preparation.Daily tests for CAT: Daily tests are very crucial for regular practice. Daily tests are to be attempted every day for all the 5 months. Always attempt the questions before checking the answers. Keep track of topics that you are not faring well in, so you can improve your basics of those by watching video concepts and solving study room problems. Cracku is offering FREE daily tests for CAT.Old CAT papers: Previous papers are useful to understand the changing trends in CAT. There is an element of surprise in every exam but there is an element of predictability too. Its is always advisable to start your preparation with previous papers as you can get an idea as to what type of questions you need to focus your efforts on. Cracku is offering FREE solved previous CAT papers.Mock Tests:Mock tests help improve accuracy and that is essential for the actual exam. Attempt online timed mocks only. After the mock, a thorough analysis of sectional and topic percentiles should be conducted. Compile a list of questions that were correct, wrong and unattempted. Look for trends in the scoring pattern. To get interview calls from IIMs you have to clear the sectional cutoffs. So, focus on weak areas after every mock. Aim to complete atleast 25 - 30 mocks before appearing for the test. Cracku is offering FREE online mocks for CAT. Every alternate Friday, a mock is released that is FREE for 3 - 4 days.Study room: Enroll to a reputed study room package that covers the entire syllabus. The more the questions the better the package is. Good questions are only half the battle. You have to ensure the package you follow has detailed solutions to all the questions as you can improve your fundamentals if you don’t know the answer to any particular question. Cracku’s CAT studyroom has 600 FREE questions with detailed solutions.Video concepts:Look for video concepts packages which cover the entire syllabus of CAT in detail. Videos should give shortcuts and tips to all the concepts. There should also be a provision to ask doubts where experts review each question and answer them accordingly. Cracku’s CAT video series has 450 videos that cover the ENTIRE syllabus of CAT and also includes video solutions of 10 most difficult questions of each Mock.With this strategy success in CAT is a guarantee. Best of Luck!","I have been training students for CAT for the last five years and I always find that one question crops up time and again: Do I have sufficient time to crack CAT? Can I do it in 7 months by studying 4-5 hours every day?My answer to this question has always been “YES and NO”.To elaborate, let us take a g at this fact: A vast majority of students of IIMs crack CAT in about 6 months time or less!This fact, in no way means that it is extremely easy to crack CAT in 6-7 months. It only means that some of the most systematic planners of the country crack this exam in 6 months or less time. Brings me to the next point: Very few test takers give any real thought to prepare systematically for CAT!4-5 hours won’t be enough if you treat it like any other exam of your life. It won’t be enough if you study as per your convenience and mood. It won’t be enough if you don’t have a fixed structure or schedule for studies. In short, random solving of some Maths questions, attending few classes and appearing for few mocks here and there is not going to be sufficient to crack CAT, even if you keep on doing it for 2 years!4-5 hours for 6 months is enough thought, if you have a systematic plan to follow, and enough motivation to keep on following it for each and every day for the next 6-7 months. Here are few bits that may help:Identify the time of the day when you are at your best: When are you most productive in your studies? Is it late nights? Early mornings? Post lunch? Identify those 2 hours that may matter the most for your career.Get your basics running: CAT has never been an exam to search for Maths genius. It just looks for smart managers who can use their time efficiently. As such, the basics of CAT come from your high school syllabus. So, there are no excuses for getting the basics wrong. Work from level zero on basics of high-school Maths if you are struggling to solve questions.Get your daily targets right: 20 questions of Maths, 2 sets of DI/LR and 2 passages of RC is the least you need to do everyday. Anything more than this will be bonus. On any single day, if this minimum target has not been achieved, you should not be able to sleep properly!Newspapers, newspapers and newspapers: If you don’t find half an hour to read and think about the newspaper editorials daily, you are doing severe damage to your intellectual discourse in the long run. MBA is a professional course and it needs you to be well aware of the issues of social, political and economic interest around the world. This parameter can’t be compromised on.Basics of calculations: Square of numbers, fraction to decimal values, tables should be there on your fingertips. This does not take too much of effort and if you don’t take the pains of being thorough with these things, you may find it difficult to solve DI questions in CAT.Set your weekly targets: 140- 150 quant questions, 7 LR sets, 7 DI sets and 15 RC passages is the least you should accomplish every week from now on. You must note down the number of questions done everyday on a routine sheet, and do a weekly follow-up on every Sunday.Set up a testing mechanism: About 20 mocks from any coaching centre are more than enough, if you use them properly. Starting from first week of June, make sure you appear a mock every alternate week. Besides, it is equally important to thoroughly analyze the mock within 5 days of appearing for it. Identify your mistakes, weak and strong areas, and formulate new strategies for the next mock. Every mock should me a stepping stone for the final exam.Avoid over-thinking: Think less and act more. Over analyzing, working on different permutations and combinations is not going to help unless you pick up that book on your desk and start solving questions. Just take charge of your preparation: 4-5 hours a day. This is the only thing that is in your control.These habits are essential not just to crack CAT, but also to be a successful manager in the long run. Proper time management skills, proper planning for an upcoming event, setting targets and following-up on them, measuring your performance through continuous monitoring and guidance.. all these skills, if developed properly during preparation for CAT will help you immensely in your professional life in the coming years!Brings me to the initial point: 4-5 hours for 6 months is enough, only if you believe that it is enough to crack CAT. Go with your gut feeling, and don’t look back once you throw yourself in the arena. Make these 7 months the most fulfilling time of your life: the time you will cherish all your life, the result of the hard work you put in these months will make you what you will be in the coming years!Remember, hours don't count. Your daily targets do.Enjoy your CAT preparation.Aditya MishraDirector, IBT Institute Ranchi(99.2 percentile in CAT 2015)."
CAT,How should I prepare for CAT 2018 if I am starting from now?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-prepare-for-CAT-2018-if-I-am-starting-from-now,"CAT 2018 Aspirant, CSE 2018 Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",100+,"Strategy for CAT preparation could vary significantly from person to person depending on your current abilities and in general, there is no one size fits all strategy that you could refer to. In this answer I will try to write a comprehensive guide assuming an average initial level in all the 3 sections namely VA, DI-LR & QAQuantitative Ability:Probably the favorite section for engineers. A big chunk of CAT aspirants tend to overestimate their skills in this section (including myself in my first attempt when my percentile turned out to be lowest in QA among the 3 sections). Preparation of Quant largely involves two parts, concept and speedConcept:Focus on building your fundamentals first. Solve basic questions from all the topics that you struggle in, don’t time your attempts initially, what matters now is learning and accuracy. Make sure to not leave out any topic, people generally tend to leave out numbers or geometry and put all their time in solving algebra problems or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your prep. Remember to get an access of 99+ percentile in Quant, you need to solve around 28/34 questions (based on recent CAT papers) and leaving out entire topics would not help your cause.Material: Any good textbook or coaching class material should be enough for studying fundamentals. You can also checkout few good Youtube channels.You should ideally be done with the fundamentals of all the topics by July 31st, latest by 10th of August.Speed:Once you have a good grasp on the fundamentals, you can work on building up your speed. Here’s where it gets tricky, simply mugging up tables, ratios, squares and cubes would do little good. The idea is to be able to develop the skill to solve a question without using old school methods.This could involve solving questions using option elimination, rough estimation, logical guesswork etc.But then how do you develop this skill. The answer, as trivial or stupid as it may sound is that you need to stop solving questions using the straight forward, lengthy original methods. Instead, try to solve it using a different, shorter method, try using the options, if the options are numerically far apart try to estimate the range of the answer, just avoid old school!!! (Can’t stress this enough)You can find good examples of how this could be done in the link below:Getting better at CAT QuantBased on observation, for developing speed, questions that are present online (based on your test series) tend to be better than questions in standard textbooksResult: You will notice that you might not be able to find a shortcut in roughly 80% of the questions. But the skill you develop and the amount of time it will save on the remaining 20% will make a huge difference. To illustrate, you will be able to solve around 7 questions in under 45 seconds each as opposed to the average 1.8 to 2 minutes. This gives you roughly 8 to 9 minutes extra in the paper, which could be the difference between a 97 percentile and a 99.5 percentile in Quant.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:A high initial ability is a big plus in this section. But even if you are not very good at verbal in your current stage of preparation, significant improvements can be made that can potentially take you beyond the 99 percentile mark in VA-RCFirst and foremost, if your current level in VA-RC is average you need to solve atleast one Reading Comprehension set every single day. There are no shortcuts here. This worked wonders for me. There are two things you need to focus on while you solve RCs viz. Reading speed and thought flow of the author. I stress on reading speed because it is essential that you are atleast able to read and give a fair attempt to all 34 questions. That’s not going to happen if you take 9 minutes to read an RC.Analyse each RC that you solve. Gradually time your attempts. Every time you read, try and step into the author’s shoes , try to comprehend the reason behind why the article was written in the first place. This will help you tons in those tricky summary and tone of the passage questions. Do not mark options haphazardly, read each answer option carefully, compare it to the context and your understanding of the passage and then attempt. Do not take accuracy for granted. High accuracy does wonders in the VA sections and for that matter all the 3 sections.If you are facing problems in understanding passages and see yourself getting direct questions wrong, then it might be a good idea to go back to basics, invest time there.Moving from direct questions to inference based questions, this is a bit tricky and it’s slightly hard to directly write a guide for this but remember the trick is to be able to see the passage as a logical flow of ideas and not a discrete collection of sentences. When you are able to connect each passage with the next and are able to draw out a logical story where the sum is greater than the parts, you should be able to do fairly well in Inference based questions. So focus on understanding each idea in the passage and how they connect to each other.Be patient, do not lose heart if you don’t see improvements in 5–6 days. You will notice significant difference in a month but stick to the 1+ RC a day formula. You will notice you are able to read faster which will save considerable time.Moving on to Verbal Ability,Again this is a section where improvement takes time, there is no easy way. Tracking your improvement could be even more challenging, since the improvements are gradual.So like every other section, continous practice is the way to go. Spend some time in understanding solutions for questions that you do not get right in the first go. Analysing these questions will significantly boost your skills in VA over time.You can follow the points below for different types of questions in VASummary type questions: Mark 3–4 important points or take-aways in the passage, check all the options for the one which has the most points present from what you have markedOdd-one out: First identify atleast two sentences that would be part of the passages, some sentences would obviously form a pair. See what the common theme is, check if the theme is not present in any of the options or if any of the options cannot not precede or succeed or fit between the pair you have selected, that should be your answer (Obviously, easier said than done)Para-jumbles: Absence of answer options can make these types of questions very tricky. As mentioned in the previous type, start with identifying any of the following if apparent: mandatory pair, obvious opening statement, obvious concluding statement. Build the connect from there onData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:Seeing the difficulty level of this section for the past 3 years, it’s now probably the make or break section in CAT. If you have taken past CATs or seen the questions, you will know what I am talking about.The good part is most people fail to do well in this section not because they are not prepared but either because their strategy is flawed or because they panic on D-day.I will come to the exam strategy part for all the 3 sections later in this answer, let’s first cover how you should prepare for DI-LR.One DI and one LR set every single day (if your current level is average then this is a must do). Do not directly start with practicing CAT level sets, start with basic questions. Once you are comfortable with that, move on to the intermediate level questions. After a few weeks of practice do a few easy sets again and see if you are able to solve them in under 5 mins. That’s the real trick to acing the DI-LR section. It’s not about how hard problems you are able to solve but more about how fast can you solve the easy level questions so that you can devote a fair amount of time to doing the medium level sets on D-Day.Solve all the standard type of sets including arrangements, tournaments, blood relations type questions in LR though there is close to 0% chance that any of these would come in the actual CAT, they will help you build your reasoning skills. Now when you move to the not so standard types, the way you approach them is try to map out a path in your mind that goes from what is given to what you need to find. Sounds vague but trust me it will help. You will get better at it with practice.In DI as mentioned in the QA part , have a strong grip on ratios and percentages. Fast calculations will help you do the direct questions (quite rare these days) quickly. For the non-direct ones, well again it will only come with practice. But the general approach is the same as mentioned, try to map out a way from given to what is to be found.All in all, probably the most important take away for this section is practice, practice and more practice.Bonus: The CAT Writer this blog helped me a lot during my preparation. Make sure you go through all the relevant articles in itCAT-holics This blog covers almost all Quant topics with solved problems. The questions covered in it are better (utility-wise) than what you will find in most books. Certainly a must do!Few general points:Do not panic at any point during the exam, remember, if you find the paper difficult, others are probably feeling the same. So, focus on getting max questions rightSimilarly, do not get carried away if you think the paper is easy. The worst thing you can do is get complacent mid-examYour preparation should ideally peak in September through mid October, do not exhaust yourself in the last two weeks before the test, it will do you no goodMake sure you subscribe to atleast 2 good test series, do not miss tests and analyse all the tests that you give, attempting alone without doing a post result analyses is practically uselessLastly, CAT could be a dicey exam. Do not lose heart if you are not able to do well because of some reason. It's not the end of the worldI will keep editing the answer as and when I remember more pointsFor strategy on how to attempt the CAT on D-Day you can refer to Gautam Oswal's answer to What could be the best strategy for attempting CAT paper?All the Best!Special credits: Tony Xavier","CAT is an online comprehensive entrance exam for MBA pursuits. It is a gateway, an opportunity to study in the most prestigious and brilliant colleges. It comprises of 3 sectionsQuantitative Aptitude, this one is all about elementary level of maths. You all need to revise and practice them thoroughly.Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation, this one is all about your common sense, logic and analytical skills. You should also work on your calculations and arithmetic skills to excel in this section.Reading Comprehension and Verbal ability, this section is all about your grammatical and reading skills. So, if you have been an avid reader in your school time it will benefit you but if you do not then start reading novels and newspaper right now.As, you are planning planning for CAT 18 you have ample of time to prepare and instead of rushing through the course hurriedly you can go for in-depth study plan preparing smoothly all through out. Each of these sections consist of various sub-topics and concepts that you need to prepare rigorously. As a result you will easily able to attempt any question in the exam. As said, ‘Practice makes man perfect’, you need to follow the same rule. You have to practice a lot and you can too. Give mock and solve past papers they are extremely significant and integral part of CAT preparation.You can even join a classroom or online program for expert guidance. I feel online program is much more convenient and easy to follow up if you are working simultaneously . A excellent and a leading online program for CAT aspirants is HANDA ka Funda .HANDA ka Funda’s online program provides the best preparation for CAT. From explaining basics to solving doubts it provides a round a clock assistance in everything. It has more than 750+ videos for concept understanding along with solved examples on each of them to learn their applicability. It gives you access to discussion forums where you can discuss your queries with other students and Ravi Handa sir as well. He also conducts live sessions on weekends to personally clear your problems and doubts.For more information you can visit this link: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams","A quick intro to my credentials:VARC: 79.94(99.63 percentile)LR-DI: 40.62(98.14 percentile)QA: 73.76 (98.95 percentile)Overall scaled score 194.32 (99.74 percentile)I'll try to answer assuming you have only a little knowledge of QA, LRDI , VARC. First of all, and this is very important, you should know the reason why you are attempting the CAT. Why I am saying this is that most people don't know what they are doing and why are they doing so. It is necessary to know your reason and use it to work hard.There are a lot of education institutes that help students prepare for CAT, but I would recommend TIME because their classroom programme has really helped me step up my game. In addition to that TIME’s study material covers basics very well. A very important thing here is to give AIMCATs or mock CATs to understand where are you lagging, what kind of mistakes are you making, how to remedy those mistakes, which areas to skip(do not think one too early), how can you improve your accuracy , uniqueness of these questions - repetitive or new concepts or a new dressing on the same concept. This will also help you know your forte which instills a new confidence(helpful many a times…lol). Take a note of your mental state too. Jot down these things in a diary or keep them in mind.Now let us delve into the specific subjects:VARC:Read newspapers: Make it a habit to read Economic Times daily or Business Standard. I would recommend Economic Times because it provides with a wide range of news from diverse topics. Use this to improve your reading speed (focus on accuracy not on speed), comprehension and to build up a good vocabulary. You'll learn some phrasal verbs, some idioms(not needed in cat, useful anyhow) and it also helps with grammar.Wren and Martin High School English Grammar and Composition: This book has been put together specially for Indian Subcontinent. It provides ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension and other allied areas to improve English communication.Tata McGraw Hill How to prepare for VARC by Arun Sharma: An awesome book. I‘ll admit it is tough, but it helps immensely.Merriam Webster App: Play the vocabulary game. It’s addictive, fun and helping.Read books : This has been suggested invariably by all my English teachers to improve comprehension and build vocabulary but i emphasize on it because it improves medium term memory(little eroded by RCs). Not necessary though!LR-DI: I attended my classes regularly and gave mocks. I sometimes used Arun Sharma’s books 1 and 2. It is sufficient. My LR-DI section was pretty weak, but these things helped me score decently.QA: QA was my forte. But a dry spell in QA was all that was needed to trim my overconfidence. Again, I used Arun Sharma Sir’s books and have to say I was surprised at my ignorance. The tips and tricks that sir has mentioned not only improved my efficiency but also my speed.Last things last, prepare well for CAT. Focus on knowledge. Use poor results as motivation. Use mediocre results as motivation. Use good results as motivation. Maintain a healthy mental state. Take some breaks regularly. Thanks to my friends,I could keep calm. I would get anxious or stuck in self-doubt and they’d help me to regain energy. Maintain a good physical health. 30–60 minutes of brisk walking is enough. And don’t beat up yourself for anything, just try to move past it(take the lesson ans use it wisely).Disclaimer: I did all the things above, but not even to 25% levels. So keep calm and prosper.","First of all find out each and every information related to CAT, likeOpportunities after CATNo of students present in examLast year exam analysis ( At how many number, how much percentile occur)SyllabusPaper LevelMake your percentile goalAfter seen all the information then make a strategy.

CAT,How should I prepare for CAT 2018 if I am starting from now?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-prepare-for-CAT-2018-if-I-am-starting-from-now,"CAT 2018 Aspirant, CSE 2018 Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",100+,"Strategy for CAT preparation could vary significantly from person to person depending on your current abilities and in general, there is no one size fits all strategy that you could refer to. In this answer I will try to write a comprehensive guide assuming an average initial level in all the 3 sections namely VA, DI-LR & QAQuantitative Ability:Probably the favorite section for engineers. A big chunk of CAT aspirants tend to overestimate their skills in this section (including myself in my first attempt when my percentile turned out to be lowest in QA among the 3 sections). Preparation of Quant largely involves two parts, concept and speedConcept:Focus on building your fundamentals first. Solve basic questions from all the topics that you struggle in, don’t time your attempts initially, what matters now is learning and accuracy. Make sure to not leave out any topic, people generally tend to leave out numbers or geometry and put all their time in solving algebra problems or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your prep. Remember to get an access of 99+ percentile in Quant, you need to solve around 28/34 questions (based on recent CAT papers) and leaving out entire topics would not help your cause.Material: Any good textbook or coaching class material should be enough for studying fundamentals. You can also checkout few good Youtube channels.You should ideally be done with the fundamentals of all the topics by July 31st, latest by 10th of August.Speed:Once you have a good grasp on the fundamentals, you can work on building up your speed. Here’s where it gets tricky, simply mugging up tables, ratios, squares and cubes would do little good. The idea is to be able to develop the skill to solve a question without using old school methods.This could involve solving questions using option elimination, rough estimation, logical guesswork etc.But then how do you develop this skill. The answer, as trivial or stupid as it may sound is that you need to stop solving questions using the straight forward, lengthy original methods. Instead, try to solve it using a different, shorter method, try using the options, if the options are numerically far apart try to estimate the range of the answer, just avoid old school!!! (Can’t stress this enough)You can find good examples of how this could be done in the link below:Getting better at CAT QuantBased on observation, for developing speed, questions that are present online (based on your test series) tend to be better than questions in standard textbooksResult: You will notice that you might not be able to find a shortcut in roughly 80% of the questions. But the skill you develop and the amount of time it will save on the remaining 20% will make a huge difference. To illustrate, you will be able to solve around 7 questions in under 45 seconds each as opposed to the average 1.8 to 2 minutes. This gives you roughly 8 to 9 minutes extra in the paper, which could be the difference between a 97 percentile and a 99.5 percentile in Quant.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:A high initial ability is a big plus in this section. But even if you are not very good at verbal in your current stage of preparation, significant improvements can be made that can potentially take you beyond the 99 percentile mark in VA-RCFirst and foremost, if your current level in VA-RC is average you need to solve atleast one Reading Comprehension set every single day. There are no shortcuts here. This worked wonders for me. There are two things you need to focus on while you solve RCs viz. Reading speed and thought flow of the author. I stress on reading speed because it is essential that you are atleast able to read and give a fair attempt to all 34 questions. That’s not going to happen if you take 9 minutes to read an RC.Analyse each RC that you solve. Gradually time your attempts. Every time you read, try and step into the author’s shoes , try to comprehend the reason behind why the article was written in the first place. This will help you tons in those tricky summary and tone of the passage questions. Do not mark options haphazardly, read each answer option carefully, compare it to the context and your understanding of the passage and then attempt. Do not take accuracy for granted. High accuracy does wonders in the VA sections and for that matter all the 3 sections.If you are facing problems in understanding passages and see yourself getting direct questions wrong, then it might be a good idea to go back to basics, invest time there.Moving from direct questions to inference based questions, this is a bit tricky and it’s slightly hard to directly write a guide for this but remember the trick is to be able to see the passage as a logical flow of ideas and not a discrete collection of sentences. When you are able to connect each passage with the next and are able to draw out a logical story where the sum is greater than the parts, you should be able to do fairly well in Inference based questions. So focus on understanding each idea in the passage and how they connect to each other.Be patient, do not lose heart if you don’t see improvements in 5–6 days. You will notice significant difference in a month but stick to the 1+ RC a day formula. You will notice you are able to read faster which will save considerable time.Moving on to Verbal Ability,Again this is a section where improvement takes time, there is no easy way. Tracking your improvement could be even more challenging, since the improvements are gradual.So like every other section, continous practice is the way to go. Spend some time in understanding solutions for questions that you do not get right in the first go. Analysing these questions will significantly boost your skills in VA over time.You can follow the points below for different types of questions in VASummary type questions: Mark 3–4 important points or take-aways in the passage, check all the options for the one which has the most points present from what you have markedOdd-one out: First identify atleast two sentences that would be part of the passages, some sentences would obviously form a pair. See what the common theme is, check if the theme is not present in any of the options or if any of the options cannot not precede or succeed or fit between the pair you have selected, that should be your answer (Obviously, easier said than done)Para-jumbles: Absence of answer options can make these types of questions very tricky. As mentioned in the previous type, start with identifying any of the following if apparent: mandatory pair, obvious opening statement, obvious concluding statement. Build the connect from there onData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:Seeing the difficulty level of this section for the past 3 years, it’s now probably the make or break section in CAT. If you have taken past CATs or seen the questions, you will know what I am talking about.The good part is most people fail to do well in this section not because they are not prepared but either because their strategy is flawed or because they panic on D-day.I will come to the exam strategy part for all the 3 sections later in this answer, let’s first cover how you should prepare for DI-LR.One DI and one LR set every single day (if your current level is average then this is a must do). Do not directly start with practicing CAT level sets, start with basic questions. Once you are comfortable with that, move on to the intermediate level questions. After a few weeks of practice do a few easy sets again and see if you are able to solve them in under 5 mins. That’s the real trick to acing the DI-LR section. It’s not about how hard problems you are able to solve but more about how fast can you solve the easy level questions so that you can devote a fair amount of time to doing the medium level sets on D-Day.Solve all the standard type of sets including arrangements, tournaments, blood relations type questions in LR though there is close to 0% chance that any of these would come in the actual CAT, they will help you build your reasoning skills. Now when you move to the not so standard types, the way you approach them is try to map out a path in your mind that goes from what is given to what you need to find. Sounds vague but trust me it will help. You will get better at it with practice.In DI as mentioned in the QA part , have a strong grip on ratios and percentages. Fast calculations will help you do the direct questions (quite rare these days) quickly. For the non-direct ones, well again it will only come with practice. But the general approach is the same as mentioned, try to map out a way from given to what is to be found.All in all, probably the most important take away for this section is practice, practice and more practice.Bonus: The CAT Writer this blog helped me a lot during my preparation. Make sure you go through all the relevant articles in itCAT-holics This blog covers almost all Quant topics with solved problems. The questions covered in it are better (utility-wise) than what you will find in most books. Certainly a must do!Few general points:Do not panic at any point during the exam, remember, if you find the paper difficult, others are probably feeling the same. So, focus on getting max questions rightSimilarly, do not get carried away if you think the paper is easy. The worst thing you can do is get complacent mid-examYour preparation should ideally peak in September through mid October, do not exhaust yourself in the last two weeks before the test, it will do you no goodMake sure you subscribe to atleast 2 good test series, do not miss tests and analyse all the tests that you give, attempting alone without doing a post result analyses is practically uselessLastly, CAT could be a dicey exam. Do not lose heart if you are not able to do well because of some reason. It's not the end of the worldI will keep editing the answer as and when I remember more pointsFor strategy on how to attempt the CAT on D-Day you can refer to Gautam Oswal's answer to What could be the best strategy for attempting CAT paper?All the Best!Special credits: Tony Xavier","CAT is an online comprehensive entrance exam for MBA pursuits. It is a gateway, an opportunity to study in the most prestigious and brilliant colleges. It comprises of 3 sectionsQuantitative Aptitude, this one is all about elementary level of maths. You all need to revise and practice them thoroughly.Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation, this one is all about your common sense, logic and analytical skills. You should also work on your calculations and arithmetic skills to excel in this section.Reading Comprehension and Verbal ability, this section is all about your grammatical and reading skills. So, if you have been an avid reader in your school time it will benefit you but if you do not then start reading novels and newspaper right now.As, you are planning planning for CAT 18 you have ample of time to prepare and instead of rushing through the course hurriedly you can go for in-depth study plan preparing smoothly all through out. Each of these sections consist of various sub-topics and concepts that you need to prepare rigorously. As a result you will easily able to attempt any question in the exam. As said, ‘Practice makes man perfect’, you need to follow the same rule. You have to practice a lot and you can too. Give mock and solve past papers they are extremely significant and integral part of CAT preparation.You can even join a classroom or online program for expert guidance. I feel online program is much more convenient and easy to follow up if you are working simultaneously . A excellent and a leading online program for CAT aspirants is HANDA ka Funda .HANDA ka Funda’s online program provides the best preparation for CAT. From explaining basics to solving doubts it provides a round a clock assistance in everything. It has more than 750+ videos for concept understanding along with solved examples on each of them to learn their applicability. It gives you access to discussion forums where you can discuss your queries with other students and Ravi Handa sir as well. He also conducts live sessions on weekends to personally clear your problems and doubts.For more information you can visit this link: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams","A quick intro to my credentials:VARC: 79.94(99.63 percentile)LR-DI: 40.62(98.14 percentile)QA: 73.76 (98.95 percentile)Overall scaled score 194.32 (99.74 percentile)I'll try to answer assuming you have only a little knowledge of QA, LRDI , VARC. First of all, and this is very important, you should know the reason why you are attempting the CAT. Why I am saying this is that most people don't know what they are doing and why are they doing so. It is necessary to know your reason and use it to work hard.There are a lot of education institutes that help students prepare for CAT, but I would recommend TIME because their classroom programme has really helped me step up my game. In addition to that TIME’s study material covers basics very well. A very important thing here is to give AIMCATs or mock CATs to understand where are you lagging, what kind of mistakes are you making, how to remedy those mistakes, which areas to skip(do not think one too early), how can you improve your accuracy , uniqueness of these questions - repetitive or new concepts or a new dressing on the same concept. This will also help you know your forte which instills a new confidence(helpful many a times…lol). Take a note of your mental state too. Jot down these things in a diary or keep them in mind.Now let us delve into the specific subjects:VARC:Read newspapers: Make it a habit to read Economic Times daily or Business Standard. I would recommend Economic Times because it provides with a wide range of news from diverse topics. Use this to improve your reading speed (focus on accuracy not on speed), comprehension and to build up a good vocabulary. You'll learn some phrasal verbs, some idioms(not needed in cat, useful anyhow) and it also helps with grammar.Wren and Martin High School English Grammar and Composition: This book has been put together specially for Indian Subcontinent. It provides ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension and other allied areas to improve English communication.Tata McGraw Hill How to prepare for VARC by Arun Sharma: An awesome book. I‘ll admit it is tough, but it helps immensely.Merriam Webster App: Play the vocabulary game. It’s addictive, fun and helping.Read books : This has been suggested invariably by all my English teachers to improve comprehension and build vocabulary but i emphasize on it because it improves medium term memory(little eroded by RCs). Not necessary though!LR-DI: I attended my classes regularly and gave mocks. I sometimes used Arun Sharma’s books 1 and 2. It is sufficient. My LR-DI section was pretty weak, but these things helped me score decently.QA: QA was my forte. But a dry spell in QA was all that was needed to trim my overconfidence. Again, I used Arun Sharma Sir’s books and have to say I was surprised at my ignorance. The tips and tricks that sir has mentioned not only improved my efficiency but also my speed.Last things last, prepare well for CAT. Focus on knowledge. Use poor results as motivation. Use mediocre results as motivation. Use good results as motivation. Maintain a healthy mental state. Take some breaks regularly. Thanks to my friends,I could keep calm. I would get anxious or stuck in self-doubt and they’d help me to regain energy. Maintain a good physical health. 30–60 minutes of brisk walking is enough. And don’t beat up yourself for anything, just try to move past it(take the lesson ans use it wisely).Disclaimer: I did all the things above, but not even to 25% levels. So keep calm and prosper.","First of all find out each and every information related to CAT, likeOpportunities after CATNo of students present in examLast year exam analysis ( At how many number, how much percentile occur)SyllabusPaper LevelMake your percentile goalAfter seen all the information then make a strategy.

CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"

Take the help of following blog to analysis the mock- How to Analyze Mock CATs to Improve your Scores and PercentileGood luck for your bright future.Jai Hind!","There are 3 months left for the CAT 2018. Undoubtedly, the CAT difficulty level is high. I mentioned some valuable points along with the strategy for preparation below,Preparation StrategyThere are no hard and fast rules that one can crack CAT if they start preparation very early. Some of them with just 2 months of rigorous preparation have been able to pull it off. Yes indeed. If you start early, you will have lots of time and can prepare with ease. If not, then it could be pretty strenuous but still you can pull it off provided that you have the sheer determination to do it so.Focus on the Basics/Fundamentals.Then increase the pace and also the level of your preparation.TargetTry to score a minimum of 95+ percentile in each and every section in CAT Exam to get calls from any of new IIMs. However, it is advisable to score 98+ percentile and above in each section to get calls from IIM-A,B,C. Kindly note that the CAT Scores is only one of the criteria used for the selection process and even with a very high percentile; there are no hard and fast rule that for sure you will get calls from old IIMs. My suggestion is that you try to score the maximum in the CAT exam. Still with a very high score, there is no guarantee that you will get selected.The reasons could be as mentioned below,Academics, Previous Work Experience, Diversity, Extra-curricular and your past performance. Please note that the selection is based on ’n’ number of factors and not the scores alone.Strong in Academics (Getting very high CAT percentile) but weak in personality development like lack of good effective communication skills (Includes Writing + Speaking Skills) might lead to student not doing well at all in WAT and PI.Each and every IIMs are autonomous institutions. They have their own criteria to select. So no one can question them when it comes to their credibility during the selection process.Overconfidence. Don’t be overconfident if you get 99 percentile in CAT. Please don’t forget that you have WAT and PI. Prepare well and give your best.Be careful at the time of personal interviews. Kindly respect and be very humble with the interviewers (IIM Professors). Don’t act way too smart and No Heropanti Please.Over smart. There might be many others like you who get selected. Even if they got 95 or say 97 percentile, they might run over you at the time of WAT and PI.Finally, the committee must feel convinced that you are the right selection for their prestigious institution and if they feel that you are not, then you are out.Simple strategies but could prove to be very effective:Please follow 20 mins strategy. Prepare seriously for 20 mins and then give a small break. Break depends as you can take a 1 min break to an hour. It solely boils down to you. With this strategy, even if you prepare for 10 times a day (10 x 20 mins = 200 mins = 3hrs 20 mins); then you would be able to put in 3hrs and 20 mins of valuable effort. More importantly, you will not have any starting problem as some students struggle to even start.Further, keep yourself fit by doing meditation, yoga and exercises like walking, running etc to keep yourself fit. Staying fit helps you in enhancing the body & mind and in turn helps in increasing the concentration level.Have a clear goal for your preparation. Work everyday with a plan. Systematic and consistent preparation helps you a lot. More importantly, learn it with passion. If you learn with passion, then you can enjoy studying and not creating self inflicted unwanted stress.Clear Plan and GoalI come across students at times who say that they want to do this and that and so on. Have a clear plan, stick onto your goal and learn with passion. You can then achieve what you want.Self Study or Joining Online/Classroom CoachingOne always has an option to go in for self study. But that requires a high level of self motivation, sheer hard work and lots of time to understand the concepts.In turn, if you join coaching institute, it really helps you as you get to learn from the expert faculty in respective areas and it helps you to save a lot of time, as understanding concepts can take time. Further, you tend to learn tips, strategies and short cuts from the faculties.Further for preparation, student can choose online coaching. But then, the rigor of online and classroom coaching definitely differs. Coaching institutes play an important role in imparting strategies and giving a systematic structure to the student.Other than this, student should be sincere to classes and must put the best effort as their is no substitute for hard work.Factors to be Considered for Classroom CoachingIf someone has to choose coaching institute, then the factors to be considered are1) Faculty profiles (that also include qualifications) [In my opinion, that's one of the most important factor],2) Small class size i.e Faculty : Student Ratio (Even this is a very important factor) [It is still fine if the class size is slightly large provided that very good faculties handle the class]3) Materials,4) Online Test Series (Since most of the exams are online),5) Training for Written Ability Test & Personal Interview,6) Post Counselling [To help students to choose the best of the B-Schools]Online test series, training for interviews, post counselling etc will be missing if you were to prepare on your own. It’s not how early you start or you prepare in a rush with few months to go, the most important thing is that you enjoy the journey & learn it with passion and work hard with clear goal of getting into the top B-Schools no matter what.Take Mock TestsFurther, take lots of Mock Tests (after your preparation) and do a lot of self analysis after each and every test. Through this, you would be able to analyze your strengths and weakness. More importantly, you will not repeat the same mistakes again.NOTE: SIGN Consulting has created a mark in the field of CAT Coaching because of it’s rigor and for the individual attention given to each & every student.

When it comes to a test-taking approach, one of the most important aspects you should remember is that there will always be a certain number of direct or simple questions in the QA section that are easy and doable, and identifying and cracking such questions is a major part of the challenge. Here are some practical tips that will help you during the exam time.First, be disciplined and focussed in your approach, as it will help you maintain a cool head and give you much required control and confidence during the CAT. Often, a lack of discipline is the greatest negative factor that could pull down one’s performance.Second, remember that there are no marks for trying and neither are there any extra marks for solving more difficult questions. Hence, make sure you do not waste your time on questions that seem either difficult or unfamiliar – you can always return to such questions, time permitting.When you are tackling the QA section, approach the questions in a group wise manner. This means that you first read through a group of four to five QA questions at a time, by using the ‘next’ and ‘previous’ buttons in the online interface, before actually delving into any of them. This will help you choose the right question(s) to attempt, and thereby help you optimise your time and number of attempts. Out of about five questions, consider attempting just around two or three questions. Consider attempting more only if you find them really easy.Also, while attempting any question, first put down all the given information in a structured manner, after which you will be in a position to decide whether you can proceed further or whether you should leave that question and move on. Try to check for alternative approaches like elimination/substitution of choices, which often save a lot of time and pay rich dividends. These can be mastered only through practice. Further, an important aspect of the CAT is the on-screen calculator provided during the test. While the utility of the calculator in a section like QA would be much less when compared to a section like DILR, there may still be some questions where using the calculator would help save time, if not completely solve them. In order to make the most of the features, you should ensure that you get enough practice with it.You should also actively mark questions for review, if you think that you may be able to solve them with some more effort, so that, time permitting, you could come back to look at them. This way, you would be working through the 34 QA questions in around seven groups of about five questions each. And each group should take you about 5 to 6 minutes, on an average, thereby completing one round of the section in 35 to 40 minutes. And by then you would have attempted anywhere from 14 to 18 questions already, with at least another 20 minutes or so to return to the questions marked for review. In fact, this strategy of managing about 15 to 20 minutes of spare time will work wonders for you if you implement it well, wherein the extra time at the end could also bring another 8 to 10 questions into Play at - development in progress the end of the day, you need to remember that a level- and cool-headed approach will make all the difference. So, give it your best and do not worry too much about the result, at least not while you are taking the exam!Best wishes from all of us at T.I.M.E.!"
CAT,How should I prepare for CAT 2018 if I am starting from now?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-prepare-for-CAT-2018-if-I-am-starting-from-now,"CAT 2018 Aspirant, CSE 2018 Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",100+,"Strategy for CAT preparation could vary significantly from person to person depending on your current abilities and in general, there is no one size fits all strategy that you could refer to. In this answer I will try to write a comprehensive guide assuming an average initial level in all the 3 sections namely VA, DI-LR & QAQuantitative Ability:Probably the favorite section for engineers. A big chunk of CAT aspirants tend to overestimate their skills in this section (including myself in my first attempt when my percentile turned out to be lowest in QA among the 3 sections). Preparation of Quant largely involves two parts, concept and speedConcept:Focus on building your fundamentals first. Solve basic questions from all the topics that you struggle in, don’t time your attempts initially, what matters now is learning and accuracy. Make sure to not leave out any topic, people generally tend to leave out numbers or geometry and put all their time in solving algebra problems or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your prep. Remember to get an access of 99+ percentile in Quant, you need to solve around 28/34 questions (based on recent CAT papers) and leaving out entire topics would not help your cause.Material: Any good textbook or coaching class material should be enough for studying fundamentals. You can also checkout few good Youtube channels.You should ideally be done with the fundamentals of all the topics by July 31st, latest by 10th of August.Speed:Once you have a good grasp on the fundamentals, you can work on building up your speed. Here’s where it gets tricky, simply mugging up tables, ratios, squares and cubes would do little good. The idea is to be able to develop the skill to solve a question without using old school methods.This could involve solving questions using option elimination, rough estimation, logical guesswork etc.But then how do you develop this skill. The answer, as trivial or stupid as it may sound is that you need to stop solving questions using the straight forward, lengthy original methods. Instead, try to solve it using a different, shorter method, try using the options, if the options are numerically far apart try to estimate the range of the answer, just avoid old school!!! (Can’t stress this enough)You can find good examples of how this could be done in the link below:Getting better at CAT QuantBased on observation, for developing speed, questions that are present online (based on your test series) tend to be better than questions in standard textbooksResult: You will notice that you might not be able to find a shortcut in roughly 80% of the questions. But the skill you develop and the amount of time it will save on the remaining 20% will make a huge difference. To illustrate, you will be able to solve around 7 questions in under 45 seconds each as opposed to the average 1.8 to 2 minutes. This gives you roughly 8 to 9 minutes extra in the paper, which could be the difference between a 97 percentile and a 99.5 percentile in Quant.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:A high initial ability is a big plus in this section. But even if you are not very good at verbal in your current stage of preparation, significant improvements can be made that can potentially take you beyond the 99 percentile mark in VA-RCFirst and foremost, if your current level in VA-RC is average you need to solve atleast one Reading Comprehension set every single day. There are no shortcuts here. This worked wonders for me. There are two things you need to focus on while you solve RCs viz. Reading speed and thought flow of the author. I stress on reading speed because it is essential that you are atleast able to read and give a fair attempt to all 34 questions. That’s not going to happen if you take 9 minutes to read an RC.Analyse each RC that you solve. Gradually time your attempts. Every time you read, try and step into the author’s shoes , try to comprehend the reason behind why the article was written in the first place. This will help you tons in those tricky summary and tone of the passage questions. Do not mark options haphazardly, read each answer option carefully, compare it to the context and your understanding of the passage and then attempt. Do not take accuracy for granted. High accuracy does wonders in the VA sections and for that matter all the 3 sections.If you are facing problems in understanding passages and see yourself getting direct questions wrong, then it might be a good idea to go back to basics, invest time there.Moving from direct questions to inference based questions, this is a bit tricky and it’s slightly hard to directly write a guide for this but remember the trick is to be able to see the passage as a logical flow of ideas and not a discrete collection of sentences. When you are able to connect each passage with the next and are able to draw out a logical story where the sum is greater than the parts, you should be able to do fairly well in Inference based questions. So focus on understanding each idea in the passage and how they connect to each other.Be patient, do not lose heart if you don’t see improvements in 5–6 days. You will notice significant difference in a month but stick to the 1+ RC a day formula. You will notice you are able to read faster which will save considerable time.Moving on to Verbal Ability,Again this is a section where improvement takes time, there is no easy way. Tracking your improvement could be even more challenging, since the improvements are gradual.So like every other section, continous practice is the way to go. Spend some time in understanding solutions for questions that you do not get right in the first go. Analysing these questions will significantly boost your skills in VA over time.You can follow the points below for different types of questions in VASummary type questions: Mark 3–4 important points or take-aways in the passage, check all the options for the one which has the most points present from what you have markedOdd-one out: First identify atleast two sentences that would be part of the passages, some sentences would obviously form a pair. See what the common theme is, check if the theme is not present in any of the options or if any of the options cannot not precede or succeed or fit between the pair you have selected, that should be your answer (Obviously, easier said than done)Para-jumbles: Absence of answer options can make these types of questions very tricky. As mentioned in the previous type, start with identifying any of the following if apparent: mandatory pair, obvious opening statement, obvious concluding statement. Build the connect from there onData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:Seeing the difficulty level of this section for the past 3 years, it’s now probably the make or break section in CAT. If you have taken past CATs or seen the questions, you will know what I am talking about.The good part is most people fail to do well in this section not because they are not prepared but either because their strategy is flawed or because they panic on D-day.I will come to the exam strategy part for all the 3 sections later in this answer, let’s first cover how you should prepare for DI-LR.One DI and one LR set every single day (if your current level is average then this is a must do). Do not directly start with practicing CAT level sets, start with basic questions. Once you are comfortable with that, move on to the intermediate level questions. After a few weeks of practice do a few easy sets again and see if you are able to solve them in under 5 mins. That’s the real trick to acing the DI-LR section. It’s not about how hard problems you are able to solve but more about how fast can you solve the easy level questions so that you can devote a fair amount of time to doing the medium level sets on D-Day.Solve all the standard type of sets including arrangements, tournaments, blood relations type questions in LR though there is close to 0% chance that any of these would come in the actual CAT, they will help you build your reasoning skills. Now when you move to the not so standard types, the way you approach them is try to map out a path in your mind that goes from what is given to what you need to find. Sounds vague but trust me it will help. You will get better at it with practice.In DI as mentioned in the QA part , have a strong grip on ratios and percentages. Fast calculations will help you do the direct questions (quite rare these days) quickly. For the non-direct ones, well again it will only come with practice. But the general approach is the same as mentioned, try to map out a way from given to what is to be found.All in all, probably the most important take away for this section is practice, practice and more practice.Bonus: The CAT Writer this blog helped me a lot during my preparation. Make sure you go through all the relevant articles in itCAT-holics This blog covers almost all Quant topics with solved problems. The questions covered in it are better (utility-wise) than what you will find in most books.

So, focus on getting max questions rightSimilarly, do not get carried away if you think the paper is easy.

It is a gateway, an opportunity to study in the most prestigious and brilliant colleges. It comprises of 3 sectionsQuantitative Aptitude, this one is all about elementary level of maths. You all need to revise and practice them thoroughly.Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation, this one is all about your common sense, logic and analytical skills. You should also work on your calculations and arithmetic skills to excel in this section.Reading Comprehension and Verbal ability, this section is all about your grammatical and reading skills. So, if you have been an avid reader in your school time it will benefit you but if you do not then start reading novels and newspaper right now.As, you are planning planning for CAT 18 you have ample of time to prepare and instead of rushing through the course hurriedly you can go for in-depth study plan preparing smoothly all through out. Each of these sections consist of various sub-topics and concepts that you need to prepare rigorously. As a result you will easily able to attempt any question in the exam. As said, ‘Practice makes man perfect’, you need to follow the same rule. You have to practice a lot and you can too. Give mock and solve past papers they are extremely significant and integral part of CAT preparation.You can even join a classroom or online program for expert guidance. I feel online program is much more convenient and easy to follow up if you are working simultaneously . A excellent and a leading online program for CAT aspirants is HANDA ka Funda .HANDA ka Funda’s online program provides the best preparation for CAT. From explaining basics to solving doubts it provides a round a clock assistance in everything. It has more than 750+ videos for concept understanding along with solved examples on each of them to learn their applicability. It gives you access to discussion forums where you can discuss your queries with other students and Ravi Handa sir as well. He also conducts live sessions on weekends to personally clear your problems and doubts.For more information you can visit this link: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams","A quick intro to my credentials:VARC: 79.94(99.63 percentile)LR-DI: 40.62(98.14 percentile)QA: 73.76 (98.95 percentile)Overall scaled score 194.32 (99.74 percentile)I'll try to answer assuming you have only a little knowledge of QA, LRDI , VARC. First of all, and this is very important, you should know the reason why you are attempting the CAT. Why I am saying this is that most people don't know what they are doing and why are they doing so. It is necessary to know your reason and use it to work hard.There are a lot of education institutes that help students prepare for CAT, but I would recommend TIME because their classroom programme has really helped me step up my game. In addition to that TIME’s study material covers basics very well. A very important thing here is to give AIMCATs or mock CATs to understand where are you lagging, what kind of mistakes are you making, how to remedy those mistakes, which areas to skip(do not think one too early), how can you improve your accuracy , uniqueness of these questions - repetitive or new concepts or a new dressing on the same concept. This will also help you know your forte which instills a new confidence(helpful many a times…lol). Take a note of your mental state too. Jot down these things in a diary or keep them in mind.Now let us delve into the specific subjects:VARC:Read newspapers: Make it a habit to read Economic Times daily or Business Standard. I would recommend Economic Times because it provides with a wide range of news from diverse topics. Use this to improve your reading speed (focus on accuracy not on speed), comprehension and to build up a good vocabulary. You'll learn some phrasal verbs, some idioms(not needed in cat, useful anyhow) and it also helps with grammar.Wren and Martin High School English Grammar and Composition: This book has been put together specially for Indian Subcontinent. It provides ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension and other allied areas to improve English communication.Tata McGraw Hill How to prepare for VARC by Arun Sharma: An awesome book. I‘ll admit it is tough, but it helps immensely.Merriam Webster App: Play the vocabulary game. It’s addictive, fun and helping.Read books : This has been suggested invariably by all my English teachers to improve comprehension and build vocabulary but i emphasize on it because it improves medium term memory(little eroded by RCs). Not necessary though!LR-DI: I attended my classes regularly and gave mocks. I sometimes used Arun Sharma’s books 1 and 2. It is sufficient. My LR-DI section was pretty weak, but these things helped me score decently.QA: QA was my forte. But a dry spell in QA was all that was needed to trim my overconfidence. Again, I used Arun Sharma Sir’s books and have to say I was surprised at my ignorance. The tips and tricks that sir has mentioned not only improved my efficiency but also my speed.Last things last, prepare well for CAT. Focus on knowledge. Use poor results as motivation. Use mediocre results as motivation. Use good results as motivation. Maintain a healthy mental state. Take some breaks regularly. Thanks to my friends,I could keep calm. I would get anxious or stuck in self-doubt and they’d help me to regain energy. Maintain a good physical health. 30–60 minutes of brisk walking is enough. And don’t beat up yourself for anything, just try to move past it(take the lesson ans use it wisely).Disclaimer: I did all the things above, but not even to 25% levels. So keep calm and prosper.","First of all find out each and every information related to CAT, likeOpportunities after CATNo of students present in examLast year exam analysis ( At how many number, how much percentile occur)SyllabusPaper LevelMake your percentile goalAfter seen all the information then make a strategy.

Whenever you Whenever you get distracted, you can dream about the day when you will crack the exam and it will definitely motivate you.Syllabus:This is a useful tip for almost any exam. Before starting you must be aware that what will ask in exam and keep a point in mind that you have to creak the exam not to do Ph.D on syllabus. You have to prepare only that part that is asked in exam. The syllabus is divided into 3 sections:Quantitative Ability (QA) [34 Questions]Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DILR) [32 Questions]Verbal & Reading Comprehension (VARC) [34 Questions]The concepts used in this examination are broadly of class 10 level but the questions are little bit tricky. To solve a paper in a given time limit it require good amount of logical thinking and lots of practice.For complete detail of syllabus you can go through my previous answer: Deepak Saini's answer to What is the syllabus of the CAT?Join coaching:It is always better to have a guide/mentor when you prepare for a competitive exam.

Try to maintain environment of mock test same as main exam environment like-Proper sitting arrangement.Take mock on same timing of final CAT exam.No disturbance etc.10 full length mocks are sufficient if you will done following things after every mock-Focus on the number of errors made. Try to minimize errors, they don’t have more than 2 in QA section, not more than 2 in LRDI section, not more than 20% in VARC section. If you are doing more error than this number means you are also attempting those question also whom your are not 100% sure.Look beyond scores and percentiles. Score and percentile is just a number, they might make you feel good or bad but you have to look beyond this.Attempt the entire paper again. An average CAT aspirant attempts 50–60 question in mock mean they have miss out a large number of good questions. Re-attempt it again without time pressure.Analyze your question, set, passage selection. After re-attempt the mock evaluate yourself on those parameters- Did I attempt the correct questions in Quant?, Did I pick the right sets in LR/DI?, Did I pick the right passages in RC? etc in my first attempt.Identify the strategy that works best for you. Follow a strategy that will help you to solve more question. According to me attempt every section in two phases. In phase 1 attempt all easy question that you can solve easily in less time and mark those question that can be solved by you but they take more time. In phase 2 attempt all marked question. This strategy will sure you that you don’t leave any easy question.Identify your weak areas. After analysis 2–3 mocks, you will identify your weak areas and than work out on that before attempting next mock.Check if you are slipping in your strong areas. Some time this happen when you are over confident on your strong area and don’t give enough time to this. You can identify this during identify weak area. This should not be happen, if this is happen than work out on it also.Plan your next mock.

One might say read,read and read but i would say read smartly,read wisely and read actively.What does i mean by that? Rather then picking up any news paper and reading editorials i would suggest you to solve RC online on daily basis. Solve atleast 5-6 RC daily in a time constraint manner. That is why effectively reading is important.You can actually join iquanta crash course from CAT Preparation online - IQuanta They will be posting several rc each day and will be providing detail solution.LR-DIThis is a stressful section for everyone.I would highly recommend you join iquanta facebook page CAT Preparation - iQuanta where you will find Daily LR-DI events where they are providing 3-4 high level of LR-DI sets every day with detail solution and that is completely free.

That leads to the feeling of having seen the similar question but not knowing how to solve it. For each of the sections, the revision should be done differently:Verbal Ability: Revise all the mistakes you have made while solving questions. DO NOT REPEAT these mistakes in mocks from now onwards.DI/LR: Revise logic required to solve all the sets you have solved so far. Also, the structure required to solve these problems.Quantitative Aptitude: Revise all the types of questions you have solved. Do not focus on solving a lot of similar types of questions now. Arun Sharma and all the similar thick books should be avoided.CAT Previous years’ papers: CAT 1990 to CAT 2008 and CAT 2017 (2 slots) papers are available in the public domain. Solve all the papers, even if you feel that similar types of questions are not asked in different sections.Exam Strategy: CAT is not a single exam, it is 3 exams of 1 hour each. Here is what you have to keep in mind while writing mocks:Verbal Ability: You need to have a very high level of accuracy. Everyone attempts 30+ questions in English but with accuracy not more than 70%. 25*3=75 was 99.9 percentile even last year when VA is considered to be easy.DI/LR: It is all about selection. Make a selection strategy. Give first 5–8 minutes of the section in selecting 2–3 easy sets.Quantitative Aptitude: CAT 2017 QA was easy and the pattern should continue as it benefitted non-engineers much more than earlier exams when QA was relatively difficult. To maximize the score you have to have great speed. Leave moderate and difficult questions, solve fast.If you have begun your preparation just now then you can refer to this post: Kamlesh Chauhan's answer to Can I crack the CAT 2018 if I start preparing from 16th August 2018?If you are Delhi then you can visit our center at Google Maps and we can discuss more.

CAT,How should I prepare for CAT 2018 if I am starting from now?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-prepare-for-CAT-2018-if-I-am-starting-from-now,"CAT 2018 Aspirant, CSE 2018 Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",100+,"Strategy for CAT preparation could vary significantly from person to person depending on your current abilities and in general, there is no one size fits all strategy that you could refer to. In this answer I will try to write a comprehensive guide assuming an average initial level in all the 3 sections namely VA, DI-LR & QAQuantitative Ability:Probably the favorite section for engineers. A big chunk of CAT aspirants tend to overestimate their skills in this section (including myself in my first attempt when my percentile turned out to be lowest in QA among the 3 sections). Preparation of Quant largely involves two parts, concept and speedConcept:Focus on building your fundamentals first. Solve basic questions from all the topics that you struggle in, don’t time your attempts initially, what matters now is learning and accuracy. Make sure to not leave out any topic, people generally tend to leave out numbers or geometry and put all their time in solving algebra problems or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your prep. Remember to get an access of 99+ percentile in Quant, you need to solve around 28/34 questions (based on recent CAT papers) and leaving out entire topics would not help your cause.Material: Any good textbook or coaching class material should be enough for studying fundamentals. You can also checkout few good Youtube channels.You should ideally be done with the fundamentals of all the topics by July 31st, latest by 10th of August.Speed:Once you have a good grasp on the fundamentals, you can work on building up your speed. Here’s where it gets tricky, simply mugging up tables, ratios, squares and cubes would do little good. The idea is to be able to develop the skill to solve a question without using old school methods.This could involve solving questions using option elimination, rough estimation, logical guesswork etc.But then how do you develop this skill. The answer, as trivial or stupid as it may sound is that you need to stop solving questions using the straight forward, lengthy original methods. Instead, try to solve it using a different, shorter method, try using the options, if the options are numerically far apart try to estimate the range of the answer, just avoid old school!!! (Can’t stress this enough)You can find good examples of how this could be done in the link below:Getting better at CAT QuantBased on observation, for developing speed, questions that are present online (based on your test series) tend to be better than questions in standard textbooksResult: You will notice that you might not be able to find a shortcut in roughly 80% of the questions. But the skill you develop and the amount of time it will save on the remaining 20% will make a huge difference. To illustrate, you will be able to solve around 7 questions in under 45 seconds each as opposed to the average 1.8 to 2 minutes. This gives you roughly 8 to 9 minutes extra in the paper, which could be the difference between a 97 percentile and a 99.5 percentile in Quant.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:A high initial ability is a big plus in this section. But even if you are not very good at verbal in your current stage of preparation, significant improvements can be made that can potentially take you beyond the 99 percentile mark in VA-RCFirst and foremost, if your current level in VA-RC is average you need to solve atleast one Reading Comprehension set every single day. There are no shortcuts here. This worked wonders for me. There are two things you need to focus on while you solve RCs viz. Reading speed and thought flow of the author. I stress on reading speed because it is essential that you are atleast able to read and give a fair attempt to all 34 questions. That’s not going to happen if you take 9 minutes to read an RC.Analyse each RC that you solve. Gradually time your attempts. Every time you read, try and step into the author’s shoes , try to comprehend the reason behind why the article was written in the first place. This will help you tons in those tricky summary and tone of the passage questions. Do not mark options haphazardly, read each answer option carefully, compare it to the context and your understanding of the passage and then attempt. Do not take accuracy for granted. High accuracy does wonders in the VA sections and for that matter all the 3 sections.If you are facing problems in understanding passages and see yourself getting direct questions wrong, then it might be a good idea to go back to basics, invest time there.Moving from direct questions to inference based questions, this is a bit tricky and it’s slightly hard to directly write a guide for this but remember the trick is to be able to see the passage as a logical flow of ideas and not a discrete collection of sentences. When you are able to connect each passage with the next and are able to draw out a logical story where the sum is greater than the parts, you should be able to do fairly well in Inference based questions. So focus on understanding each idea in the passage and how they connect to each other.Be patient, do not lose heart if you don’t see improvements in 5–6 days. You will notice significant difference in a month but stick to the 1+ RC a day formula. You will notice you are able to read faster which will save considerable time.Moving on to Verbal Ability,Again this is a section where improvement takes time, there is no easy way. Tracking your improvement could be even more challenging, since the improvements are gradual.So like every other section, continous practice is the way to go. Spend some time in understanding solutions for questions that you do not get right in the first go. Analysing these questions will significantly boost your skills in VA over time.You can follow the points below for different types of questions in VASummary type questions: Mark 3–4 important points or take-aways in the passage, check all the options for the one which has the most points present from what you have markedOdd-one out: First identify atleast two sentences that would be part of the passages, some sentences would obviously form a pair. See what the common theme is, check if the theme is not present in any of the options or if any of the options cannot not precede or succeed or fit between the pair you have selected, that should be your answer (Obviously, easier said than done)Para-jumbles: Absence of answer options can make these types of questions very tricky. As mentioned in the previous type, start with identifying any of the following if apparent: mandatory pair, obvious opening statement, obvious concluding statement. Build the connect from there onData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:Seeing the difficulty level of this section for the past 3 years, it’s now probably the make or break section in CAT. If you have taken past CATs or seen the questions, you will know what I am talking about.The good part is most people fail to do well in this section not because they are not prepared but either because their strategy is flawed or because they panic on D-day.I will come to the exam strategy part for all the 3 sections later in this answer, let’s first cover how you should prepare for DI-LR.One DI and one LR set every single day (if your current level is average then this is a must do). Do not directly start with practicing CAT level sets, start with basic questions. Once you are comfortable with that, move on to the intermediate level questions. After a few weeks of practice do a few easy sets again and see if you are able to solve them in under 5 mins. That’s the real trick to acing the DI-LR section. It’s not about how hard problems you are able to solve but more about how fast can you solve the easy level questions so that you can devote a fair amount of time to doing the medium level sets on D-Day.Solve all the standard type of sets including arrangements, tournaments, blood relations type questions in LR though there is close to 0% chance that any of these would come in the actual CAT, they will help you build your reasoning skills. Now when you move to the not so standard types, the way you approach them is try to map out a path in your mind that goes from what is given to what you need to find. Sounds vague but trust me it will help. You will get better at it with practice.In DI as mentioned in the QA part , have a strong grip on ratios and percentages. Fast calculations will help you do the direct questions (quite rare these days) quickly. For the non-direct ones, well again it will only come with practice.

A excellent and a leading online program for CAT aspirants is HANDA ka Funda .HANDA ka Funda’s online program provides the best preparation for CAT. From explaining basics to solving doubts it provides a round a clock assistance in everything. It has more than 750+ videos for concept understanding along with solved examples on each of them to learn their applicability. It gives you access to discussion forums where you can discuss your queries with other students and Ravi Handa sir as well. He also conducts live sessions on weekends to personally clear your problems and doubts.For more information you can visit this link: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams","A quick intro to my credentials:VARC: 79.94(99.63 percentile)LR-DI: 40.62(98.14 percentile)QA: 73.76 (98.95 percentile)Overall scaled score 194.32 (99.74 percentile)I'll try to answer assuming you have only a little knowledge of QA, LRDI , VARC. First of all, and this is very important, you should know the reason why you are attempting the CAT. Why I am saying this is that most people don't know what they are doing and why are they doing so. It is necessary to know your reason and use it to work hard.There are a lot of education institutes that help students prepare for CAT, but I would recommend TIME because their classroom programme has really helped me step up my game. In addition to that TIME’s study material covers basics very well. A very important thing here is to give AIMCATs or mock CATs to understand where are you lagging, what kind of mistakes are you making, how to remedy those mistakes, which areas to skip(do not think one too early), how can you improve your accuracy , uniqueness of these questions - repetitive or new concepts or a new dressing on the same concept. This will also help you know your forte which instills a new confidence(helpful many a times…lol). Take a note of your mental state too. Jot down these things in a diary or keep them in mind.Now let us delve into the specific subjects:VARC:Read newspapers: Make it a habit to read Economic Times daily or Business Standard. I would recommend Economic Times because it provides with a wide range of news from diverse topics. Use this to improve your reading speed (focus on accuracy not on speed), comprehension and to build up a good vocabulary. You'll learn some phrasal verbs, some idioms(not needed in cat, useful anyhow) and it also helps with grammar.Wren and Martin High School English Grammar and Composition: This book has been put together specially for Indian Subcontinent. It provides ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension and other allied areas to improve English communication.Tata McGraw Hill How to prepare for VARC by Arun Sharma: An awesome book. I‘ll admit it is tough, but it helps immensely.Merriam Webster App: Play the vocabulary game. It’s addictive, fun and helping.Read books : This has been suggested invariably by all my English teachers to improve comprehension and build vocabulary but i emphasize on it because it improves medium term memory(little eroded by RCs). Not necessary though!LR-DI: I attended my classes regularly and gave mocks. I sometimes used Arun Sharma’s books 1 and 2. It is sufficient. My LR-DI section was pretty weak, but these things helped me score decently.QA: QA was my forte. But a dry spell in QA was all that was needed to trim my overconfidence. Again, I used Arun Sharma Sir’s books and have to say I was surprised at my ignorance. The tips and tricks that sir has mentioned not only improved my efficiency but also my speed.Last things last, prepare well for CAT. Focus on knowledge. Use poor results as motivation. Use mediocre results as motivation. Use good results as motivation. Maintain a healthy mental state. Take some breaks regularly. Thanks to my friends,I could keep calm. I would get anxious or stuck in self-doubt and they’d help me to regain energy. Maintain a good physical health. 30–60 minutes of brisk walking is enough. And don’t beat up yourself for anything, just try to move past it(take the lesson ans use it wisely).Disclaimer: I did all the things above, but not even to 25% levels. So keep calm and prosper.","First of all find out each and every information related to CAT, likeOpportunities after CATNo of students present in examLast year exam analysis ( At how many number, how much percentile occur)SyllabusPaper LevelMake your percentile goalAfter seen all the information then make a strategy.

CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,Which online coaching for the CAT 2018 gives personal attention?,https://www.quora.com//Which-online-coaching-for-the-CAT-2018-gives-personal-attention,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",13,"Every 2nd coaching institute claims that they provide personal attention to students in CAT preparation but when student joins the journey is entirely different. In Delhi, Alchemist has been making difference in CAT preparation with best online tools. These tools let the students control the preparation:Class SchedulingAlchemist has created modular approach and to proper execution of same they have created Alchemist Scheduler, which helps the students book their class as per own availability. This also Alchemist adhering to their batch size of 25. With the technology neither the student nor Alchemist itself can increase the batch size.Performance Analysis ToolAlchemist has been utilizing the Online Analysis Tool called OnlineMocks which enables Alchemist as well as students keeping track of performance. Students can track where they have reached and where they are lacking or good at for CAT exam. This begins with a SWOT analysis, as knowing your weaknesses and strengths is very important.KnowDoubtThe most important, Alchemist uses an App called KnowDoubt, where the students can clear their doubts with other students and faculty. This has eradicated the use of WhatsApp groups which is used by various coaching institute that breaches student’s privacy as there gets shared with the whole batch.","Learn Quest.1. Professors-Anuj Kumar Sinha and Nikhil Goyal are perspicacious and know their subject very well.LRDI in CAT is not a cakewalk.Exposure to new questions, clearing the basics is a must for picking the right questions in exam.LQ does that right.2.Mode of conduct-Facebook being one of the developed platforms for discussions i was very comfortable learning through that.One can save posts, tag the professor when in doubt , share posts, etcAlso, the site will not crash when there is unprecedented load factor so I can even revise in the last week.PS : In November 2017, TIME , CL site crashed so revising Aimcats / Mocks was a Herculean task.3. Doubt clearance-One can approach them 24*7 with the doubts.Also, there is one added advantage- to post your doubts is the group so that anyone can answer.4.Personal attention-The Professor bothers to ask students in person- How is your preparation going?What challenges are you facing?Or look at your scores and without mincing words tell you that your style of studying is incorrect.This is awesome5. Constant Motivation-When Aimcats throws surprises at you, when your scores plummet , faith in yourself will keep you pushing.The peers and professors won't let you spiral down.I could add more points.But, the most important thing for me is what i learn.Everything else is just perks.And Learn Quest will never disappoint you.So overall i would suggest the future aspirants to join LQ for learning and TIME / CL/ IMS / Hitbullseye atleast 2 out of the 4 to practice what was learnt.","A lots of online courses available in market but here i am writing only one name that is Handa Ka Funda.

CAT,How should I prepare for CAT 2018 if I am starting from now?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-prepare-for-CAT-2018-if-I-am-starting-from-now,"CAT 2018 Aspirant, CSE 2018 Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",100+,"Strategy for CAT preparation could vary significantly from person to person depending on your current abilities and in general, there is no one size fits all strategy that you could refer to. In this answer I will try to write a comprehensive guide assuming an average initial level in all the 3 sections namely VA, DI-LR & QAQuantitative Ability:Probably the favorite section for engineers. A big chunk of CAT aspirants tend to overestimate their skills in this section (including myself in my first attempt when my percentile turned out to be lowest in QA among the 3 sections). Preparation of Quant largely involves two parts, concept and speedConcept:Focus on building your fundamentals first. Solve basic questions from all the topics that you struggle in, don’t time your attempts initially, what matters now is learning and accuracy. Make sure to not leave out any topic, people generally tend to leave out numbers or geometry and put all their time in solving algebra problems or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your prep. Remember to get an access of 99+ percentile in Quant, you need to solve around 28/34 questions (based on recent CAT papers) and leaving out entire topics would not help your cause.Material: Any good textbook or coaching class material should be enough for studying fundamentals. You can also checkout few good Youtube channels.You should ideally be done with the fundamentals of all the topics by July 31st, latest by 10th of August.Speed:Once you have a good grasp on the fundamentals, you can work on building up your speed. Here’s where it gets tricky, simply mugging up tables, ratios, squares and cubes would do little good. The idea is to be able to develop the skill to solve a question without using old school methods.This could involve solving questions using option elimination, rough estimation, logical guesswork etc.But then how do you develop this skill. The answer, as trivial or stupid as it may sound is that you need to stop solving questions using the straight forward, lengthy original methods. Instead, try to solve it using a different, shorter method, try using the options, if the options are numerically far apart try to estimate the range of the answer, just avoid old school!!! (Can’t stress this enough)You can find good examples of how this could be done in the link below:Getting better at CAT QuantBased on observation, for developing speed, questions that are present online (based on your test series) tend to be better than questions in standard textbooksResult: You will notice that you might not be able to find a shortcut in roughly 80% of the questions. But the skill you develop and the amount of time it will save on the remaining 20% will make a huge difference. To illustrate, you will be able to solve around 7 questions in under 45 seconds each as opposed to the average 1.8 to 2 minutes. This gives you roughly 8 to 9 minutes extra in the paper, which could be the difference between a 97 percentile and a 99.5 percentile in Quant.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:A high initial ability is a big plus in this section. But even if you are not very good at verbal in your current stage of preparation, significant improvements can be made that can potentially take you beyond the 99 percentile mark in VA-RCFirst and foremost, if your current level in VA-RC is average you need to solve atleast one Reading Comprehension set every single day. There are no shortcuts here. This worked wonders for me. There are two things you need to focus on while you solve RCs viz. Reading speed and thought flow of the author. I stress on reading speed because it is essential that you are atleast able to read and give a fair attempt to all 34 questions. That’s not going to happen if you take 9 minutes to read an RC.Analyse each RC that you solve. Gradually time your attempts. Every time you read, try and step into the author’s shoes , try to comprehend the reason behind why the article was written in the first place. This will help you tons in those tricky summary and tone of the passage questions. Do not mark options haphazardly, read each answer option carefully, compare it to the context and your understanding of the passage and then attempt. Do not take accuracy for granted. High accuracy does wonders in the VA sections and for that matter all the 3 sections.If you are facing problems in understanding passages and see yourself getting direct questions wrong, then it might be a good idea to go back to basics, invest time there.Moving from direct questions to inference based questions, this is a bit tricky and it’s slightly hard to directly write a guide for this but remember the trick is to be able to see the passage as a logical flow of ideas and not a discrete collection of sentences. When you are able to connect each passage with the next and are able to draw out a logical story where the sum is greater than the parts, you should be able to do fairly well in Inference based questions. So focus on understanding each idea in the passage and how they connect to each other.Be patient, do not lose heart if you don’t see improvements in 5–6 days. You will notice significant difference in a month but stick to the 1+ RC a day formula. You will notice you are able to read faster which will save considerable time.Moving on to Verbal Ability,Again this is a section where improvement takes time, there is no easy way. Tracking your improvement could be even more challenging, since the improvements are gradual.So like every other section, continous practice is the way to go. Spend some time in understanding solutions for questions that you do not get right in the first go. Analysing these questions will significantly boost your skills in VA over time.You can follow the points below for different types of questions in VASummary type questions: Mark 3–4 important points or take-aways in the passage, check all the options for the one which has the most points present from what you have markedOdd-one out: First identify atleast two sentences that would be part of the passages, some sentences would obviously form a pair. See what the common theme is, check if the theme is not present in any of the options or if any of the options cannot not precede or succeed or fit between the pair you have selected, that should be your answer (Obviously, easier said than done)Para-jumbles: Absence of answer options can make these types of questions very tricky. As mentioned in the previous type, start with identifying any of the following if apparent: mandatory pair, obvious opening statement, obvious concluding statement. Build the connect from there onData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:Seeing the difficulty level of this section for the past 3 years, it’s now probably the make or break section in CAT. If you have taken past CATs or seen the questions, you will know what I am talking about.The good part is most people fail to do well in this section not because they are not prepared but either because their strategy is flawed or because they panic on D-day.I will come to the exam strategy part for all the 3 sections later in this answer, let’s first cover how you should prepare for DI-LR.One DI and one LR set every single day (if your current level is average then this is a must do). Do not directly start with practicing CAT level sets, start with basic questions. Once you are comfortable with that, move on to the intermediate level questions. After a few weeks of practice do a few easy sets again and see if you are able to solve them in under 5 mins. That’s the real trick to acing the DI-LR section. It’s not about how hard problems you are able to solve but more about how fast can you solve the easy level questions so that you can devote a fair amount of time to doing the medium level sets on D-Day.Solve all the standard type of sets including arrangements, tournaments, blood relations type questions in LR though there is close to 0% chance that any of these would come in the actual CAT, they will help you build your reasoning skills. Now when you move to the not so standard types, the way you approach them is try to map out a path in your mind that goes from what is given to what you need to find. Sounds vague but trust me it will help. You will get better at it with practice.In DI as mentioned in the QA part , have a strong grip on ratios and percentages. Fast calculations will help you do the direct questions (quite rare these days) quickly. For the non-direct ones, well again it will only come with practice. But the general approach is the same as mentioned, try to map out a way from given to what is to be found.All in all, probably the most important take away for this section is practice, practice and more practice.Bonus: The CAT Writer this blog helped me a lot during my preparation. Make sure you go through all the relevant articles in itCAT-holics This blog covers almost all Quant topics with solved problems. The questions covered in it are better (utility-wise) than what you will find in most books. Certainly a must do!Few general points:Do not panic at any point during the exam, remember, if you find the paper difficult, others are probably feeling the same. So, focus on getting max questions rightSimilarly, do not get carried away if you think the paper is easy. The worst thing you can do is get complacent mid-examYour preparation should ideally peak in September through mid October, do not exhaust yourself in the last two weeks before the test, it will do you no goodMake sure you subscribe to atleast 2 good test series, do not miss tests and analyse all the tests that you give, attempting alone without doing a post result analyses is practically uselessLastly, CAT could be a dicey exam. Do not lose heart if you are not able to do well because of some reason. It's not the end of the worldI will keep editing the answer as and when I remember more pointsFor strategy on how to attempt the CAT on D-Day you can refer to Gautam Oswal's answer to What could be the best strategy for attempting CAT paper?All the Best!Special credits: Tony Xavier","CAT is an online comprehensive entrance exam for MBA pursuits. It is a gateway, an opportunity to study in the most prestigious and brilliant colleges. It comprises of 3 sectionsQuantitative Aptitude, this one is all about elementary level of maths. You all need to revise and practice them thoroughly.Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation, this one is all about your common sense, logic and analytical skills. You should also work on your calculations and arithmetic skills to excel in this section.Reading Comprehension and Verbal ability, this section is all about your grammatical and reading skills. So, if you have been an avid reader in your school time it will benefit you but if you do not then start reading novels and newspaper right now.As, you are planning planning for CAT 18 you have ample of time to prepare and instead of rushing through the course hurriedly you can go for in-depth study plan preparing smoothly all through out. Each of these sections consist of various sub-topics and concepts that you need to prepare rigorously. As a result you will easily able to attempt any question in the exam. As said, ‘Practice makes man perfect’, you need to follow the same rule. You have to practice a lot and you can too. Give mock and solve past papers they are extremely significant and integral part of CAT preparation.You can even join a classroom or online program for expert guidance. I feel online program is much more convenient and easy to follow up if you are working simultaneously . A excellent and a leading online program for CAT aspirants is HANDA ka Funda .HANDA ka Funda’s online program provides the best preparation for CAT. From explaining basics to solving doubts it provides a round a clock assistance in everything. It has more than 750+ videos for concept understanding along with solved examples on each of them to learn their applicability. It gives you access to discussion forums where you can discuss your queries with other students and Ravi Handa sir as well. He also conducts live sessions on weekends to personally clear your problems and doubts.For more information you can visit this link: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams","A quick intro to my credentials:VARC: 79.94(99.63 percentile)LR-DI: 40.62(98.14 percentile)QA: 73.76 (98.95 percentile)Overall scaled score 194.32 (99.74 percentile)I'll try to answer assuming you have only a little knowledge of QA, LRDI , VARC. First of all, and this is very important, you should know the reason why you are attempting the CAT. Why I am saying this is that most people don't know what they are doing and why are they doing so. It is necessary to know your reason and use it to work hard.There are a lot of education institutes that help students prepare for CAT, but I would recommend TIME because their classroom programme has really helped me step up my game. In addition to that TIME’s study material covers basics very well. A very important thing here is to give AIMCATs or mock CATs to understand where are you lagging, what kind of mistakes are you making, how to remedy those mistakes, which areas to skip(do not think one too early), how can you improve your accuracy , uniqueness of these questions - repetitive or new concepts or a new dressing on the same concept. This will also help you know your forte which instills a new confidence(helpful many a times…lol). Take a note of your mental state too. Jot down these things in a diary or keep them in mind.Now let us delve into the specific subjects:VARC:Read newspapers: Make it a habit to read Economic Times daily or Business Standard. I would recommend Economic Times because it provides with a wide range of news from diverse topics. Use this to improve your reading speed (focus on accuracy not on speed), comprehension and to build up a good vocabulary. You'll learn some phrasal verbs, some idioms(not needed in cat, useful anyhow) and it also helps with grammar.Wren and Martin High School English Grammar and Composition: This book has been put together specially for Indian Subcontinent. It provides ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension and other allied areas to improve English communication.Tata McGraw Hill How to prepare for VARC by Arun Sharma: An awesome book. I‘ll admit it is tough, but it helps immensely.Merriam Webster App: Play the vocabulary game. It’s addictive, fun and helping.Read books : This has been suggested invariably by all my English teachers to improve comprehension and build vocabulary but i emphasize on it because it improves medium term memory(little eroded by RCs). Not necessary though!LR-DI: I attended my classes regularly and gave mocks. I sometimes used Arun Sharma’s books 1 and 2. It is sufficient. My LR-DI section was pretty weak, but these things helped me score decently.QA: QA was my forte. But a dry spell in QA was all that was needed to trim my overconfidence. Again, I used Arun Sharma Sir’s books and have to say I was surprised at my ignorance. The tips and tricks that sir has mentioned not only improved my efficiency but also my speed.Last things last, prepare well for CAT. Focus on knowledge. Use poor results as motivation. Use mediocre results as motivation. Use good results as motivation. Maintain a healthy mental state. Take some breaks regularly. Thanks to my friends,I could keep calm. I would get anxious or stuck in self-doubt and they’d help me to regain energy. Maintain a good physical health. 30–60 minutes of brisk walking is enough. And don’t beat up yourself for anything, just try to move past it(take the lesson ans use it wisely).Disclaimer: I did all the things above, but not even to 25% levels. So keep calm and prosper.","First of all find out each and every information related to CAT, likeOpportunities after CATNo of students present in examLast year exam analysis ( At how many number, how much percentile occur)SyllabusPaper LevelMake your percentile goalAfter seen all the information then make a strategy.

Before starting you must be aware that what will ask in exam and keep a point in mind that you have to creak the exam not to do Ph.D on syllabus. You have to prepare only that part that is asked in exam. The syllabus is divided into 3 sections:Quantitative Ability (QA) [34 Questions]Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DILR) [32 Questions]Verbal & Reading Comprehension (VARC) [34 Questions]The concepts used in this examination are broadly of class 10 level but the questions are little bit tricky.

CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,How should I prepare for CAT 2018 if I am starting from now?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-prepare-for-CAT-2018-if-I-am-starting-from-now,"CAT 2018 Aspirant, CSE 2018 Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",100+,"Strategy for CAT preparation could vary significantly from person to person depending on your current abilities and in general, there is no one size fits all strategy that you could refer to. In this answer I will try to write a comprehensive guide assuming an average initial level in all the 3 sections namely VA, DI-LR & QAQuantitative Ability:Probably the favorite section for engineers. A big chunk of CAT aspirants tend to overestimate their skills in this section (including myself in my first attempt when my percentile turned out to be lowest in QA among the 3 sections). Preparation of Quant largely involves two parts, concept and speedConcept:Focus on building your fundamentals first. Solve basic questions from all the topics that you struggle in, don’t time your attempts initially, what matters now is learning and accuracy. Make sure to not leave out any topic, people generally tend to leave out numbers or geometry and put all their time in solving algebra problems or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your prep. Remember to get an access of 99+ percentile in Quant, you need to solve around 28/34 questions (based on recent CAT papers) and leaving out entire topics would not help your cause.Material: Any good textbook or coaching class material should be enough for studying fundamentals. You can also checkout few good Youtube channels.You should ideally be done with the fundamentals of all the topics by July 31st, latest by 10th of August.Speed:Once you have a good grasp on the fundamentals, you can work on building up your speed. Here’s where it gets tricky, simply mugging up tables, ratios, squares and cubes would do little good. The idea is to be able to develop the skill to solve a question without using old school methods.This could involve solving questions using option elimination, rough estimation, logical guesswork etc.But then how do you develop this skill. The answer, as trivial or stupid as it may sound is that you need to stop solving questions using the straight forward, lengthy original methods. Instead, try to solve it using a different, shorter method, try using the options, if the options are numerically far apart try to estimate the range of the answer, just avoid old school!!! (Can’t stress this enough)You can find good examples of how this could be done in the link below:Getting better at CAT QuantBased on observation, for developing speed, questions that are present online (based on your test series) tend to be better than questions in standard textbooksResult: You will notice that you might not be able to find a shortcut in roughly 80% of the questions. But the skill you develop and the amount of time it will save on the remaining 20% will make a huge difference. To illustrate, you will be able to solve around 7 questions in under 45 seconds each as opposed to the average 1.8 to 2 minutes. This gives you roughly 8 to 9 minutes extra in the paper, which could be the difference between a 97 percentile and a 99.5 percentile in Quant.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:A high initial ability is a big plus in this section. But even if you are not very good at verbal in your current stage of preparation, significant improvements can be made that can potentially take you beyond the 99 percentile mark in VA-RCFirst and foremost, if your current level in VA-RC is average you need to solve atleast one Reading Comprehension set every single day. There are no shortcuts here. This worked wonders for me. There are two things you need to focus on while you solve RCs viz. Reading speed and thought flow of the author. I stress on reading speed because it is essential that you are atleast able to read and give a fair attempt to all 34 questions. That’s not going to happen if you take 9 minutes to read an RC.Analyse each RC that you solve. Gradually time your attempts. Every time you read, try and step into the author’s shoes , try to comprehend the reason behind why the article was written in the first place. This will help you tons in those tricky summary and tone of the passage questions. Do not mark options haphazardly, read each answer option carefully, compare it to the context and your understanding of the passage and then attempt. Do not take accuracy for granted. High accuracy does wonders in the VA sections and for that matter all the 3 sections.If you are facing problems in understanding passages and see yourself getting direct questions wrong, then it might be a good idea to go back to basics, invest time there.Moving from direct questions to inference based questions, this is a bit tricky and it’s slightly hard to directly write a guide for this but remember the trick is to be able to see the passage as a logical flow of ideas and not a discrete collection of sentences. When you are able to connect each passage with the next and are able to draw out a logical story where the sum is greater than the parts, you should be able to do fairly well in Inference based questions. So focus on understanding each idea in the passage and how they connect to each other.Be patient, do not lose heart if you don’t see improvements in 5–6 days. You will notice significant difference in a month but stick to the 1+ RC a day formula. You will notice you are able to read faster which will save considerable time.Moving on to Verbal Ability,Again this is a section where improvement takes time, there is no easy way. Tracking your improvement could be even more challenging, since the improvements are gradual.So like every other section, continous practice is the way to go. Spend some time in understanding solutions for questions that you do not get right in the first go. Analysing these questions will significantly boost your skills in VA over time.You can follow the points below for different types of questions in VASummary type questions: Mark 3–4 important points or take-aways in the passage, check all the options for the one which has the most points present from what you have markedOdd-one out: First identify atleast two sentences that would be part of the passages, some sentences would obviously form a pair. See what the common theme is, check if the theme is not present in any of the options or if any of the options cannot not precede or succeed or fit between the pair you have selected, that should be your answer (Obviously, easier said than done)Para-jumbles: Absence of answer options can make these types of questions very tricky. As mentioned in the previous type, start with identifying any of the following if apparent: mandatory pair, obvious opening statement, obvious concluding statement. Build the connect from there onData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:Seeing the difficulty level of this section for the past 3 years, it’s now probably the make or break section in CAT. If you have taken past CATs or seen the questions, you will know what I am talking about.The good part is most people fail to do well in this section not because they are not prepared but either because their strategy is flawed or because they panic on D-day.I will come to the exam strategy part for all the 3 sections later in this answer, let’s first cover how you should prepare for DI-LR.One DI and one LR set every single day (if your current level is average then this is a must do). Do not directly start with practicing CAT level sets, start with basic questions. Once you are comfortable with that, move on to the intermediate level questions. After a few weeks of practice do a few easy sets again and see if you are able to solve them in under 5 mins. That’s the real trick to acing the DI-LR section. It’s not about how hard problems you are able to solve but more about how fast can you solve the easy level questions so that you can devote a fair amount of time to doing the medium level sets on D-Day.Solve all the standard type of sets including arrangements, tournaments, blood relations type questions in LR though there is close to 0% chance that any of these would come in the actual CAT, they will help you build your reasoning skills. Now when you move to the not so standard types, the way you approach them is try to map out a path in your mind that goes from what is given to what you need to find. Sounds vague but trust me it will help. You will get better at it with practice.In DI as mentioned in the QA part , have a strong grip on ratios and percentages. Fast calculations will help you do the direct questions (quite rare these days) quickly. For the non-direct ones, well again it will only come with practice. But the general approach is the same as mentioned, try to map out a way from given to what is to be found.All in all, probably the most important take away for this section is practice, practice and more practice.Bonus: The CAT Writer this blog helped me a lot during my preparation. Make sure you go through all the relevant articles in itCAT-holics This blog covers almost all Quant topics with solved problems. The questions covered in it are better (utility-wise) than what you will find in most books. Certainly a must do!Few general points:Do not panic at any point during the exam, remember, if you find the paper difficult, others are probably feeling the same. So, focus on getting max questions rightSimilarly, do not get carried away if you think the paper is easy. The worst thing you can do is get complacent mid-examYour preparation should ideally peak in September through mid October, do not exhaust yourself in the last two weeks before the test, it will do you no goodMake sure you subscribe to atleast 2 good test series, do not miss tests and analyse all the tests that you give, attempting alone without doing a post result analyses is practically uselessLastly, CAT could be a dicey exam. Do not lose heart if you are not able to do well because of some reason. It's not the end of the worldI will keep editing the answer as and when I remember more pointsFor strategy on how to attempt the CAT on D-Day you can refer to Gautam Oswal's answer to What could be the best strategy for attempting CAT paper?All the Best!Special credits: Tony Xavier","CAT is an online comprehensive entrance exam for MBA pursuits. It is a gateway, an opportunity to study in the most prestigious and brilliant colleges. It comprises of 3 sectionsQuantitative Aptitude, this one is all about elementary level of maths. You all need to revise and practice them thoroughly.Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation, this one is all about your common sense, logic and analytical skills. You should also work on your calculations and arithmetic skills to excel in this section.Reading Comprehension and Verbal ability, this section is all about your grammatical and reading skills. So, if you have been an avid reader in your school time it will benefit you but if you do not then start reading novels and newspaper right now.As, you are planning planning for CAT 18 you have ample of time to prepare and instead of rushing through the course hurriedly you can go for in-depth study plan preparing smoothly all through out. Each of these sections consist of various sub-topics and concepts that you need to prepare rigorously. As a result you will easily able to attempt any question in the exam. As said, ‘Practice makes man perfect’, you need to follow the same rule. You have to practice a lot and you can too. Give mock and solve past papers they are extremely significant and integral part of CAT preparation.You can even join a classroom or online program for expert guidance. I feel online program is much more convenient and easy to follow up if you are working simultaneously . A excellent and a leading online program for CAT aspirants is HANDA ka Funda .HANDA ka Funda’s online program provides the best preparation for CAT. From explaining basics to solving doubts it provides a round a clock assistance in everything. It has more than 750+ videos for concept understanding along with solved examples on each of them to learn their applicability. It gives you access to discussion forums where you can discuss your queries with other students and Ravi Handa sir as well. He also conducts live sessions on weekends to personally clear your problems and doubts.For more information you can visit this link: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams","A quick intro to my credentials:VARC: 79.94(99.63 percentile)LR-DI: 40.62(98.14 percentile)QA: 73.76 (98.95 percentile)Overall scaled score 194.32 (99.74 percentile)I'll try to answer assuming you have only a little knowledge of QA, LRDI , VARC. First of all, and this is very important, you should know the reason why you are attempting the CAT. Why I am saying this is that most people don't know what they are doing and why are they doing so. It is necessary to know your reason and use it to work hard.There are a lot of education institutes that help students prepare for CAT, but I would recommend TIME because their classroom programme has really helped me step up my game. In addition to that TIME’s study material covers basics very well. A very important thing here is to give AIMCATs or mock CATs to understand where are you lagging, what kind of mistakes are you making, how to remedy those mistakes, which areas to skip(do not think one too early), how can you improve your accuracy , uniqueness of these questions - repetitive or new concepts or a new dressing on the same concept. This will also help you know your forte which instills a new confidence(helpful many a times…lol). Take a note of your mental state too. Jot down these things in a diary or keep them in mind.Now let us delve into the specific subjects:VARC:Read newspapers: Make it a habit to read Economic Times daily or Business Standard. I would recommend Economic Times because it provides with a wide range of news from diverse topics. Use this to improve your reading speed (focus on accuracy not on speed), comprehension and to build up a good vocabulary. You'll learn some phrasal verbs, some idioms(not needed in cat, useful anyhow) and it also helps with grammar.Wren and Martin High School English Grammar and Composition: This book has been put together specially for Indian Subcontinent. It provides ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension and other allied areas to improve English communication.Tata McGraw Hill How to prepare for VARC by Arun Sharma: An awesome book. I‘ll admit it is tough, but it helps immensely.Merriam Webster App: Play the vocabulary game. It’s addictive, fun and helping.Read books : This has been suggested invariably by all my English teachers to improve comprehension and build vocabulary but i emphasize on it because it improves medium term memory(little eroded by RCs). Not necessary though!LR-DI: I attended my classes regularly and gave mocks. I sometimes used Arun Sharma’s books 1 and 2. It is sufficient. My LR-DI section was pretty weak, but these things helped me score decently.QA: QA was my forte. But a dry spell in QA was all that was needed to trim my overconfidence. Again, I used Arun Sharma Sir’s books and have to say I was surprised at my ignorance. The tips and tricks that sir has mentioned not only improved my efficiency but also my speed.Last things last, prepare well for CAT. Focus on knowledge. Use poor results as motivation. Use mediocre results as motivation. Use good results as motivation. Maintain a healthy mental state. Take some breaks regularly. Thanks to my friends,I could keep calm. I would get anxious or stuck in self-doubt and they’d help me to regain energy. Maintain a good physical health. 30–60 minutes of brisk walking is enough. And don’t beat up yourself for anything, just try to move past it(take the lesson ans use it wisely).Disclaimer: I did all the things above, but not even to 25% levels. So keep calm and prosper.","First of all find out each and every information related to CAT, likeOpportunities after CATNo of students present in examLast year exam analysis ( At how many number, how much percentile occur)SyllabusPaper LevelMake your percentile goalAfter seen all the information then make a strategy. A person can help you to guide you only the way but you have to put the actual effort that will make the result.Begin with the end in mind:Start your preparation with sheer determination and self motivation. Whenever you Whenever you get distracted, you can dream about the day when you will crack the exam and it will definitely motivate you.Syllabus:This is a useful tip for almost any exam. Before starting you must be aware that what will ask in exam and keep a point in mind that you have to creak the exam not to do Ph.D on syllabus. You have to prepare only that part that is asked in exam. The syllabus is divided into 3 sections:Quantitative Ability (QA) [34 Questions]Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DILR) [32 Questions]Verbal & Reading Comprehension (VARC) [34 Questions]The concepts used in this examination are broadly of class 10 level but the questions are little bit tricky. To solve a paper in a given time limit it require good amount of logical thinking and lots of practice.For complete detail of syllabus you can go through my previous answer: Deepak Saini's answer to What is the syllabus of the CAT?Join coaching:It is always better to have a guide/mentor when you prepare for a competitive exam.

CAT,Should I attempt CAT 2018 when I scored 40.86 percentile in CAT 2017 by self study in 3 months without giving any mock?,https://www.quora.com//Should-I-attempt-CAT-2018-when-I-scored-40-86-percentile-in-CAT-2017-by-self-study-in-3-months-without-giving-any-mock,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",24,Yes…!! A big yes..!! I like to share my story here. I have given CAT 2016 with just 20 days preparation and just got 65 percentile . Again I gave CAT 2017 with self preparation and attempted 10 mocks and I got 93 percentile this year. Though I managed to get around 97 percentile in Quant and DI section but in verbal I just got 72 percentile for which my over all percentile dropped to 93.This happened just because I have attempted very less no of mocks . So for CAT-2018 I am preparing again and planning to give as many mocks as I can to increase my percentile to 99.99 .So I will suggest you to prepare for CAT-2018 with lots of patience and hardwork. And most important attempt as many mocks as you can.You will definitely get a very good percentile.All the best….Edit 1: Thanks for 200 upvotes . It will inspire me more and more.,"Before jumping to any conclusion go through the whole answer.Here is the ordinary story of an ordinary student.I joined coaching centre in 4th sem of engineering as I was clear since the beginning that I wanted to be in corporate world and pursue an MBA career as my family background belongs to that. I had almost 2 years to prepare for CAT. In the 2–3 nascent months I worked hard, but with time I realized that I had lost much of the time procrastinating. I did almost nothing for the next 15 months and January 2016 arrived which made me realize that I am yet to prepare for CAT 16. I gave first mock in February and scored 60%le. In next I scored 80, 75, and 80. I started gaining confidence gradually. But as college submission and semester exam started I did nothing for next 2 months. Here comes June. Four months remained. Burned midnight oil and prepared a lot. Scoring around 70–85%le. But drop started as I got busy with final year project and submission, then end semester exam. Did nothing in October, November. Went for CAT 16 without preparing last 2–3 months end up in 63%le.But the main story starts from here. I know that wasn't my best shot and I was determined to prepare again for CAT 17. Finished last sem exam in May and started preparing from very next day. Next 5 months prepared like a hell. My situation for an MBA was 'This time or never'. With 2 mock series and weekend classes, I started preparing again. There were many ups and downs in mocks with percentile as high as 93% to as low as 40%le. Generally scoring in 70–90%le. Felt blue when the score was low. More to add every day in FB, Insta there were at least 3 friends who post their Canada, USA check-in. More pressure. But determined to fight hard and never gave up. In last 2 months score fell down to around 60%le. Depressed. One close friend went abroad other two were planning. Blue. But never gave up.The first exam was, everybody's favourite, NMAT. Went well. Scored 206. Last year score was 180. I know that this was not safe score as last year's cut-off was 208.On November last Sunday, the D-day. Went well. Next Sunday IIFT, totally screwed. Next Sunday 2nd attempt of NMAT, went well. Next Sunday SNAP, not so well.Came January 2018, 1st week. Results started one by one. Snap not as expected. Nmat 206, again same score. In the 2nd week, there came CAT result, 88.42%le. I know it was not great to get a call from any IIMs or IITs. But I was happy because hard work paid. Y-o-Y growth around 40%. A journey from 63%le to 88%le was great. I pat myself on the back to never give up.Morale: Consistency, focus, determination are key to score well.","First thing; 40th percentile, that you scored, means that you ended up with a net negative score (whatever may be the normalized score is irrelevant)Although I don’t know which state of mind the question was written in as in whether you are proud that you scored 40th percentile with 3 months of self study or you are disappointed in this score; I must tell you the truth that this is a pathetic score (for a General category candidate)Now for the question; YES go for another attempt but know that you need a lot of effort to do good in the exam.As far as the score you need to target goes; it should be nothing less than 97th Percentile.Here is the General Cutoff scenario for General Category (not considering acads/workex for now; just the CAT score):Above 99.7: You have a good chance of getting calls from the old IIMs (C, K, A, S will call but not sure about Indore and Banagalore), FMS Delhi, IIT B, JBIMS MumbaiAbove 97 but less than 99: Most IITs, New IIMs , baby IIMs, MDI Gurgaon, NITIE Bombay.97> score >95: IIT Kgp, IIT M, IIT Kanpur, IIT Roorkee, MDI Gurgaon and a few others94 < score < 95: IIT Roorkee, IIT M, IIT Kanpur, MDI, IMT G, IMI Delhi90 < Score < 94: IMT G, IMI Delhi, Fore, GIM etcThe above list is based on the General Category cutoffs for the years 2011 - 2015 that I compiled when I was preparing for CAT and can be taken at face value. If some idiot advises you to apply for IITs at 89 percentile then tell him/her to fcuk off.So, as you can see, the best spot for a General Category candidate in the CAT exam is a score above 97 percentile; below that score, the opportunities begin to dry up and the colleges that call you/offer admission are really not worth putting the time and money in.If you need help with preparation you can reach out to me in personal message.Save this list as a reminder of the rank you need to secure to get into a good college.Remember, the colleges in the <94th percentile band are a waste of resources and should not be considered.GL and start preparing for the next exam.","Offcourse!! It does not matter how much you scored in CAT 2017. Trust me, it never does. Just don’t let this percentile demotivate you or dishearten you. Turn to a new leaf and start from the very beginning. You know where you went wrong. You did not get much time to practice and it was a grave mistake appearing for CAT without taking any mock. Taking mock is the only way of securing a good percentile. That is what differentiated a 99 percentile from a 90 percentile. So never ever neglect or underestimate the power of mock exams!!Now that you have a clear idea of what you have to do, lets focus on belling the cat. The best way to prepare for cat is to take as many mocks as you can. But in order to take the mocks seriously, you need to know all the shortcuts and formula for every chapters. So I would suggest you start preparing for cat a good one and a half years before you actually take the exam. 6 months to go through all the topics individually and the rest one year to take mocks. Remember, only solving the topics individually won’t help until and unless you regularly take mocks and analyze the mocks religiously. Appear for 2-4 mocks a week. This way, in a year you will be able to take and analyze a handsome 150-160 mocks which is enough to take you to 98-99 percentile. But don’t worry, even if you don’t have a year and half at your disposal. Start as soon as possible and take as many mocks as you can. For your practice, you can take CATKing mocks. They are pretty useful. Remember one thing. This time start from the month of March-April itself, so that you get a fair amount of time to clear all your concepts. You can attend a free workshop as well to get a clearer picture. If you find the workshop useful, you can join a classroom program as well so as to get a structured and systematic learning. So, the main crux of the matter is, start your preparation with clearing the concepts and then eventually plunge into taking mocks and analyzing them. There is absolutely no other way.Hope this helps.All the best!!"
CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,How should I prepare for CAT 2018 if I am starting from now?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-prepare-for-CAT-2018-if-I-am-starting-from-now,"CAT 2018 Aspirant, CSE 2018 Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",100+,"Strategy for CAT preparation could vary significantly from person to person depending on your current abilities and in general, there is no one size fits all strategy that you could refer to. In this answer I will try to write a comprehensive guide assuming an average initial level in all the 3 sections namely VA, DI-LR & QAQuantitative Ability:Probably the favorite section for engineers. A big chunk of CAT aspirants tend to overestimate their skills in this section (including myself in my first attempt when my percentile turned out to be lowest in QA among the 3 sections). Preparation of Quant largely involves two parts, concept and speedConcept:Focus on building your fundamentals first. Solve basic questions from all the topics that you struggle in, don’t time your attempts initially, what matters now is learning and accuracy. Make sure to not leave out any topic, people generally tend to leave out numbers or geometry and put all their time in solving algebra problems or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your prep. Remember to get an access of 99+ percentile in Quant, you need to solve around 28/34 questions (based on recent CAT papers) and leaving out entire topics would not help your cause.Material: Any good textbook or coaching class material should be enough for studying fundamentals. You can also checkout few good Youtube channels.You should ideally be done with the fundamentals of all the topics by July 31st, latest by 10th of August.Speed:Once you have a good grasp on the fundamentals, you can work on building up your speed. Here’s where it gets tricky, simply mugging up tables, ratios, squares and cubes would do little good. The idea is to be able to develop the skill to solve a question without using old school methods.This could involve solving questions using option elimination, rough estimation, logical guesswork etc.But then how do you develop this skill. The answer, as trivial or stupid as it may sound is that you need to stop solving questions using the straight forward, lengthy original methods. Instead, try to solve it using a different, shorter method, try using the options, if the options are numerically far apart try to estimate the range of the answer, just avoid old school!!! (Can’t stress this enough)You can find good examples of how this could be done in the link below:Getting better at CAT QuantBased on observation, for developing speed, questions that are present online (based on your test series) tend to be better than questions in standard textbooksResult: You will notice that you might not be able to find a shortcut in roughly 80% of the questions. But the skill you develop and the amount of time it will save on the remaining 20% will make a huge difference. To illustrate, you will be able to solve around 7 questions in under 45 seconds each as opposed to the average 1.8 to 2 minutes. This gives you roughly 8 to 9 minutes extra in the paper, which could be the difference between a 97 percentile and a 99.5 percentile in Quant.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:A high initial ability is a big plus in this section. But even if you are not very good at verbal in your current stage of preparation, significant improvements can be made that can potentially take you beyond the 99 percentile mark in VA-RCFirst and foremost, if your current level in VA-RC is average you need to solve atleast one Reading Comprehension set every single day. There are no shortcuts here. This worked wonders for me. There are two things you need to focus on while you solve RCs viz. Reading speed and thought flow of the author. I stress on reading speed because it is essential that you are atleast able to read and give a fair attempt to all 34 questions. That’s not going to happen if you take 9 minutes to read an RC.Analyse each RC that you solve. Gradually time your attempts. Every time you read, try and step into the author’s shoes , try to comprehend the reason behind why the article was written in the first place. This will help you tons in those tricky summary and tone of the passage questions. Do not mark options haphazardly, read each answer option carefully, compare it to the context and your understanding of the passage and then attempt. Do not take accuracy for granted. High accuracy does wonders in the VA sections and for that matter all the 3 sections.If you are facing problems in understanding passages and see yourself getting direct questions wrong, then it might be a good idea to go back to basics, invest time there.Moving from direct questions to inference based questions, this is a bit tricky and it’s slightly hard to directly write a guide for this but remember the trick is to be able to see the passage as a logical flow of ideas and not a discrete collection of sentences. When you are able to connect each passage with the next and are able to draw out a logical story where the sum is greater than the parts, you should be able to do fairly well in Inference based questions. So focus on understanding each idea in the passage and how they connect to each other.Be patient, do not lose heart if you don’t see improvements in 5–6 days. You will notice significant difference in a month but stick to the 1+ RC a day formula. You will notice you are able to read faster which will save considerable time.Moving on to Verbal Ability,Again this is a section where improvement takes time, there is no easy way. Tracking your improvement could be even more challenging, since the improvements are gradual.So like every other section, continous practice is the way to go. Spend some time in understanding solutions for questions that you do not get right in the first go. Analysing these questions will significantly boost your skills in VA over time.You can follow the points below for different types of questions in VASummary type questions: Mark 3–4 important points or take-aways in the passage, check all the options for the one which has the most points present from what you have markedOdd-one out: First identify atleast two sentences that would be part of the passages, some sentences would obviously form a pair. See what the common theme is, check if the theme is not present in any of the options or if any of the options cannot not precede or succeed or fit between the pair you have selected, that should be your answer (Obviously, easier said than done)Para-jumbles: Absence of answer options can make these types of questions very tricky. As mentioned in the previous type, start with identifying any of the following if apparent: mandatory pair, obvious opening statement, obvious concluding statement. Build the connect from there onData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:Seeing the difficulty level of this section for the past 3 years, it’s now probably the make or break section in CAT. If you have taken past CATs or seen the questions, you will know what I am talking about.The good part is most people fail to do well in this section not because they are not prepared but either because their strategy is flawed or because they panic on D-day.I will come to the exam strategy part for all the 3 sections later in this answer, let’s first cover how you should prepare for DI-LR.One DI and one LR set every single day (if your current level is average then this is a must do). Do not directly start with practicing CAT level sets, start with basic questions. Once you are comfortable with that, move on to the intermediate level questions. After a few weeks of practice do a few easy sets again and see if you are able to solve them in under 5 mins. That’s the real trick to acing the DI-LR section. It’s not about how hard problems you are able to solve but more about how fast can you solve the easy level questions so that you can devote a fair amount of time to doing the medium level sets on D-Day.Solve all the standard type of sets including arrangements, tournaments, blood relations type questions in LR though there is close to 0% chance that any of these would come in the actual CAT, they will help you build your reasoning skills. Now when you move to the not so standard types, the way you approach them is try to map out a path in your mind that goes from what is given to what you need to find. Sounds vague but trust me it will help. You will get better at it with practice.In DI as mentioned in the QA part , have a strong grip on ratios and percentages. Fast calculations will help you do the direct questions (quite rare these days) quickly. For the non-direct ones, well again it will only come with practice. But the general approach is the same as mentioned, try to map out a way from given to what is to be found.All in all, probably the most important take away for this section is practice, practice and more practice.Bonus: The CAT Writer this blog helped me a lot during my preparation. Make sure you go through all the relevant articles in itCAT-holics This blog covers almost all Quant topics with solved problems. The questions covered in it are better (utility-wise) than what you will find in most books. Certainly a must do!Few general points:Do not panic at any point during the exam, remember, if you find the paper difficult, others are probably feeling the same. So, focus on getting max questions rightSimilarly, do not get carried away if you think the paper is easy. The worst thing you can do is get complacent mid-examYour preparation should ideally peak in September through mid October, do not exhaust yourself in the last two weeks before the test, it will do you no goodMake sure you subscribe to atleast 2 good test series, do not miss tests and analyse all the tests that you give, attempting alone without doing a post result analyses is practically uselessLastly, CAT could be a dicey exam. Do not lose heart if you are not able to do well because of some reason. It's not the end of the worldI will keep editing the answer as and when I remember more pointsFor strategy on how to attempt the CAT on D-Day you can refer to Gautam Oswal's answer to What could be the best strategy for attempting CAT paper?All the Best!Special credits: Tony Xavier","CAT is an online comprehensive entrance exam for MBA pursuits. It is a gateway, an opportunity to study in the most prestigious and brilliant colleges. It comprises of 3 sectionsQuantitative Aptitude, this one is all about elementary level of maths. You all need to revise and practice them thoroughly.Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation, this one is all about your common sense, logic and analytical skills. You should also work on your calculations and arithmetic skills to excel in this section.Reading Comprehension and Verbal ability, this section is all about your grammatical and reading skills. So, if you have been an avid reader in your school time it will benefit you but if you do not then start reading novels and newspaper right now.As, you are planning planning for CAT 18 you have ample of time to prepare and instead of rushing through the course hurriedly you can go for in-depth study plan preparing smoothly all through out. Each of these sections consist of various sub-topics and concepts that you need to prepare rigorously. As a result you will easily able to attempt any question in the exam. As said, ‘Practice makes man perfect’, you need to follow the same rule. You have to practice a lot and you can too. Give mock and solve past papers they are extremely significant and integral part of CAT preparation.You can even join a classroom or online program for expert guidance. I feel online program is much more convenient and easy to follow up if you are working simultaneously . A excellent and a leading online program for CAT aspirants is HANDA ka Funda .HANDA ka Funda’s online program provides the best preparation for CAT. From explaining basics to solving doubts it provides a round a clock assistance in everything. It has more than 750+ videos for concept understanding along with solved examples on each of them to learn their applicability. It gives you access to discussion forums where you can discuss your queries with other students and Ravi Handa sir as well. He also conducts live sessions on weekends to personally clear your problems and doubts.For more information you can visit this link: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams","A quick intro to my credentials:VARC: 79.94(99.63 percentile)LR-DI: 40.62(98.14 percentile)QA: 73.76 (98.95 percentile)Overall scaled score 194.32 (99.74 percentile)I'll try to answer assuming you have only a little knowledge of QA, LRDI , VARC. First of all, and this is very important, you should know the reason why you are attempting the CAT. Why I am saying this is that most people don't know what they are doing and why are they doing so. It is necessary to know your reason and use it to work hard.There are a lot of education institutes that help students prepare for CAT, but I would recommend TIME because their classroom programme has really helped me step up my game. In addition to that TIME’s study material covers basics very well. A very important thing here is to give AIMCATs or mock CATs to understand where are you lagging, what kind of mistakes are you making, how to remedy those mistakes, which areas to skip(do not think one too early), how can you improve your accuracy , uniqueness of these questions - repetitive or new concepts or a new dressing on the same concept. This will also help you know your forte which instills a new confidence(helpful many a times…lol). Take a note of your mental state too. Jot down these things in a diary or keep them in mind.Now let us delve into the specific subjects:VARC:Read newspapers: Make it a habit to read Economic Times daily or Business Standard. I would recommend Economic Times because it provides with a wide range of news from diverse topics. Use this to improve your reading speed (focus on accuracy not on speed), comprehension and to build up a good vocabulary. You'll learn some phrasal verbs, some idioms(not needed in cat, useful anyhow) and it also helps with grammar.Wren and Martin High School English Grammar and Composition: This book has been put together specially for Indian Subcontinent. It provides ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension and other allied areas to improve English communication.Tata McGraw Hill How to prepare for VARC by Arun Sharma: An awesome book. I‘ll admit it is tough, but it helps immensely.Merriam Webster App: Play the vocabulary game. It’s addictive, fun and helping.Read books : This has been suggested invariably by all my English teachers to improve comprehension and build vocabulary but i emphasize on it because it improves medium term memory(little eroded by RCs). Not necessary though!LR-DI: I attended my classes regularly and gave mocks. I sometimes used Arun Sharma’s books 1 and 2. It is sufficient. My LR-DI section was pretty weak, but these things helped me score decently.QA: QA was my forte. But a dry spell in QA was all that was needed to trim my overconfidence. Again, I used Arun Sharma Sir’s books and have to say I was surprised at my ignorance. The tips and tricks that sir has mentioned not only improved my efficiency but also my speed.Last things last, prepare well for CAT. Focus on knowledge. Use poor results as motivation. Use mediocre results as motivation. Use good results as motivation. Maintain a healthy mental state. Take some breaks regularly. Thanks to my friends,I could keep calm. I would get anxious or stuck in self-doubt and they’d help me to regain energy. Maintain a good physical health. 30–60 minutes of brisk walking is enough. And don’t beat up yourself for anything, just try to move past it(take the lesson ans use it wisely).Disclaimer: I did all the things above, but not even to 25% levels. So keep calm and prosper.","First of all find out each and every information related to CAT, likeOpportunities after CATNo of students present in examLast year exam analysis ( At how many number, how much percentile occur)SyllabusPaper LevelMake your percentile goalAfter seen all the information then make a strategy.

CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"

CAT 2017 was my first attempt, and I scored 99.98 percentile (scaled score - 222.81). My sectionals are: VARC - 98.15 (71.07), LRDI - 99.76 (53.68), QA - 100 (98.09). My past academic record is: Class 10th - 10 CGPA, Class 12th - 95%, Grad - 77% (up to 7th semester).In the days after the CAT 2017 result got announced, I got hundreds of queries from friends, seniors, juniors and random people from across the wide internet. So I decided to post an answer on a public platform, so that it may be used by anyone wishing to excel at CAT.DISCLAIMERThis was my first attempt at CAT. I do not claim to be an expert. This answer simply lists my own views and things which helped me succeed at CAT. Different things might apply to different people.BACKGROUNDI began my preparation in August 2016, at the beginning of my 3rd year. I was a classroom student at TIME Delhi. Simultaneously I joined the Facebook group iQuanta (Log into Facebook | Facebook), which was a group for like-minded CAT aspirants. I think iQuanta played the biggest role in my preparation. Even when I couldn't go to classes due to exams or other reasons, I kept solving questions on the group.Moreover, I was pretty good at Maths and English ever since my school days, owing in most part to JEE and board exam prep. This also made it easier for me to face DI sets. So basically my weakest section when I started out was LRDI, and especially LR.Initially, I spent most of my time strengthening the QA section, often neglecting the other sections. This became a problem for me once the mock season started because even though I was doing well in QA and VARC, my LRDI scores were lagging far behind. Another reason was that I had no defined strategy for LRDI, and hence I often went haywire if I had to face a difficult set. So August 2017 onward, I spent most of my time on LRDI, solving questions and developing my own strategies.I did not spend much time studying from books. I've always believed that practice is the best form of preparation. So I invested most of my time in doing practice questions and giving mocks, and as I said solving questions on iQuanta. Giving mocks is probably the most important thing one has to do in their CAT preparation. It prepares you for all sorts of possibilities.IMPORTANCE OF COACHINGI took coaching. I was part of the classroom course at one of the most renowned institutes. And personally, I’ve come to feel that classroom coaching is not necessary for CAT. There are amazing web courses available like iQuanta, at a fraction of the price of the classroom courses. The best strategy for an aspirant would be to take 2 mock series from renowned institutes, 1 booklet series, and then make use of any one web course. I’ve myself found iQuanta (CAT Preparation - IQuanta) to be the best in their domain.SECTION WISE STRATEGYSo keeping that background in mind, here are some tips and tricks, advice and suggestions, that helped me get a high score. Keep in mind that no trick is a substitute for hard work. Each and every aspirant would have one or two strong sections, and the other not-so-strong or weak sections. If it is your strongest area, make it your fort. No matter how difficult the questions, they shouldn't be able to budge you.VARC - This looks like it is the easiest section, and often it is. After all, we've all learned English all through our education. But it isn't. And for most people, it is really difficult to differentiate between an easy, and a tricky section.To improve at VARC, the first step is to improve your reading speed. Because you cannot do well in this section unless you can go through all 34 questions. So read a lot. Any source whatsoever. Prefer to use diverse sources to improve your domain knowledge of various fields at the same time. Quora is a wonderful resource, use it.Most of the practice that one needs for this section can be gained from mocks, and you can improve immensely if you work hard.LRDI - This is the weakest section for most, if not all aspirants. And frankly speaking, there is no book or mock series available that can prepare you for CAT level LRDI. But what can prepare you is having a good strategy.My strategy was that even before starting with the first set, I read all of the 8 sets, and set a priority order in which I was going to attempt them. This usually takes about 5-6 mins, but that time is worth spending. In a CAT-like situation, with a tough LRDI section, while others got stuck in tougher sets, I raced ahead and did not have to worry at any moment.Also, read and try to understand wide-ranging business scenarios. Over the last couple of years CAT has moved on to very practical scenarios in its questions (restaurants, ticket reservation etc.), and if you can understand the underlying logic, it becomes easier to solve the set.QA - Probably the one section where you have the highest likelihood of increasing your score. The score in this section often differentiates a 99.5 percentiler and a 100 percentiler (about 30 marks differentiate them).The QA section is where the Facebook group iQuanta helped me immensely. Any aspirant who isn’t a member of this group, must join immediately. I started solving doubts from other people in this group, and I really enjoyed doing it. And because of that, I was introduced to a huge variety of questions that I might never have faced otherwise.The strategy for a good QA section is to have sound basics. So if anyone is struggling with basics, start with NCERT textbooks. Because if you have good basics, you'll be able to visualize each and every problem, and would often be able t predict what the question setter is going to ask, even before reading the entire question.CONCLUSIONAt last, just remember that CAT isn't a difficult exam. It is just testing some core skills and nothing advanced. Just push yourself with the mantra, ""If I can't, then no one can"".","When you’re talking about the CAT (regardless of whether its CAT 2017 or 2018 or 2019) and the strategy one needs to crack the exam, there are two major questions which you need to ask yourself.1. How comfortable are you with the three (QA/DI-LR/VA) sections which are a part of the exam?This is an important question, perhaps more important than any question you might answer in the actual exam. That’s cause the spectre of sectional cutoffs means that you have to be ‘good’ in all three sections, or at the very least ‘good’ in two and passable in one. A weakness in one section will prove fatal for your entire examination.2. What is your background? and how expressive are you as a person?The story of the GEM with 99+ percentile who could not convert a good b school is so oft repeated now that its become a bit of a cliche at this point .Educational background is immensely important here. Additionally, a good CAT percentile is not the be all-end all of the B school journey. Getting selected in the high pressure environment of a GD/PI is a different ball game altogether. You’ve probably heard of enough people with good percentiles who choked when it came to expressing themselves on the ‘big stage’ so I won’t try to scare you with their stories at this point.In my opinion, what you need is a comprehensive guideline on how to crack the exam. Not only do you need an entity which can help you get a good percentile in this exam, you’ll also need someone to help you become more expressive and capable of handling pressure during the Interview/GD process.This ‘entity’ I’ve spoken about could be anyone. It could be a teacher, a mentor, a friend, a coaching institute …anyone who can help you perform the dual tasks of cracking the exam+cracking the GD/PI process.For this purpose, I would suggest Breakspace (Breakspace | Home). A picture is worth a thousand words, and this effectively conveys all I have to say about this institute.The rest I leave to your intelligence and discretion.","THANKS for A2ACommon admission test can be cleared by having good aptitude, English. If you dont have, you can learn, practice and get a good CAT Score.The first thing you need to do is have a unshakable belief that you can ace the CAT because you will see lots of ups and downs in these few months so it’s really important to not to loose focus.Do not stress yourself too much with the preparation. Do not imprison yourself with the preparation plan alone. Spend time doing your favorite activities too.Hard Work is the key to success!Stick with this strategy throughout your preparations and success will follow you. Believe in your strategy and more importantly in yourself.Next you need is a strategy or a game plan for next few months. No one can tell you whats the best way to prepare for for you but there are some basic guidelines which will help you find your way.You have so much time before you take the shot .One thing i will suggest you is read,read and read!! Read Hindu editorials,international newspaper and make your opnion on the national ,international issues and more importantly work more on your overall profile including extracurricular and acads (as you are still in college)Before you start full fledged preparation , I will suggest you to take an diagnostic testfor CAT(or past year paper) to know where you stand in terms of level of your Maths,English ,LR/DI .Quantitative Aptitude and Data Interpretation: Practice is the key here. There are hardly any topics which take more than 2 hours to complete. But without practicing it is as good as nothing.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension: Read. Read. Read. Reading is the exercise for brain and just any other muscle you need workout to improve its capability. Take up reading as your favorite pastime. Try to read extensive opinionated / argumentative articles from good sources viz. British magazines, English newspapers, etc. Not only should you read it fast, but also understand how the writer flows the article and reaches a conclusion.Offline coaching brings in the benefit of being disciplined by the schedule. You are pulled up for missing classes and the home work, recommendations for the next week or fortnight keeps you going.In case you want to join any coaching Institute, I will suggest you to join KITABEE , It has maximum students clearing CAT exam in terms of Percentage. Very qualified faculty.For any aspirant, the following factors are of prime importance when it comes to joining a coaching institute:1. [math]Personal[/math] [math]attention[/math] - I think the most important factor is this. If personal attention and mentoring is missing, don't join. When you are evaluating institutes, go and check their classrooms for batch size. Ask for a demo session, if possible. Go and take a demo class you will realize why i am suggesting KITABEE.2.[math] Faculty[/math] - In addition to point 1, look for faculties who have gone through the whole process as they can understand you better and guide you better. Ask for faculty details. See if you can talk to them. According to me “[math]Neeraj[/math] [math]sir[/math]” is the best teacher just call him and ask any doubt if you have. [math]7838804491[/math], 9718375475, 9540897459.3. [math]Content/Material/mocks[/math] -At KITABEE content is getting frequently updated to match the recent trends. As I said, not a differentiating factor. Mocks used to be a differentiating factor, go and visit Kitabee Site.In KITABEE you will get ample of materials to practise. There will be regular classes and after the completion of the class you will be given handouts which will comprise of the same thing taught in class . You should manage your time so well that you should practise every material. The study material are designed in such a way that it matches with CAT level. Believe me if you just do the study material religiously you will surely score more than 90 percentile. Besides that you will be given sectional tests which will be little advanced . And then comes the NEERAJ SIR’S AIMCAT.Clearing your doubts is another important thing to follow every timeKitabee focuses even on other exams like IIFT, SNAP, NMAT, XAT etc and regular mocks and revision sessions help the students perform better in these exams as each and every exam is a different ball game and needs a different strategy to excel.As the number of students is less there is a personal bond between the students and the mentors and this makes the faculty members very much approachable. Neraj Sir and Pratik Sir are a constant source of motivation for the students and help them work harder and harder.This pic was uploaded by Kitabee on Facebook …KITABEE WILL HELP YOU IN ANALYZING ……….What are your areas of strength? For Example, Quant is your area of strength. Jolly Good!! Which subjects do you excel in Quant. Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry ?? Make sure you score cent percent in them. What are your areas of weakness?? Probability. Make sure you learn the basics to exploit the low hanging fruits.What are your areas of weakness? For example, VA (verbal ability). Which parts do you score in VA. Synonyms/Antonyms, Paragraph reading, Sentence corrections. Awesome!! Concentrate only on these areas and make sure this is enough to cross the line.Enroll for a test package.Give each test as if it the d-day. Determine time allocations as per your comfort. I generally follow 30–30–30–10 rule. 30% of time per each section to cross the line and final 10% of time to maximize my score.Your preparation doesn't end here. It starts now. After each test, go through each answer diligently. This helps you evaluate your strengths and weakness.For example, you fumbled with Data sets. Great!! Go back to basics. Read and solve everything you can lay hand on for the next one week. Your aim for the next test should be zero mistakes in Data sets.On a normal basis, your All India percentile in these tests is more or less your upcoming CAT score unless you somehow achieve super powers on the D-day and perform exceedingly well.Believe in yourSELF AND IN KITABEE ……!Aren’t you convinced yet. Well, that’s how I made it during my CAT being an average student, from an average college.And its a separate ball game altogether, if you are talking about GDPI.All the best!! Work smart, bell the CAT!!RegardsRahul"
CAT,How can I start my CAT prep for 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-start-my-CAT-prep-for-2018,"CAT Preparation 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",18,"Well the answer depends on whether you have appeared earlier in the exam or not.For freshers:1)VARC-start reading novels/newspaper editorials or few online websites on a daily basis.There are 3 main question types that you need to focus upon:a)Reading comprehension(RCs)-You can’t crack CAT until you have a strong hold on this section. For initial stage read diverse subjects and try to comprehend what the author wants to convey. Then start practicing from books of any coaching material. I would suggest TIME.Also take sectional tests.b)summary and para completion-Relatively the easiest part of VARC section where you should have very high accuracy.Practice frm same coaching material and take sectional tests.The options may not be accurate but you need to select the relatively most accurate option.c)Para jumbled and odd one out-odd one out is again an easy part but para jumbled is one of the difficult parts of CAT since there are no options given. You need to have enough practice of reading and solving these questions to get them correct but I would suggest to leave them anyway.Overall VARC is one of the most scoring sections in CAT as the paragraphs are not very hard to comprehend. The only problem is the options which are too close and one should be very good at elimination.2)LRDI-Most of the people find this section difficult but I never faced such issue. I will discuss my strategy. Hopefully it will help. There is no separate strategy for LR and DI. If there is a proper DI question with no logic required(Data based) solve it right away because you don’t need to solve all the questions in DI. just try to solve 4 sets out of the 8. Then try to solve the LR which is your strength(Sudoku type for me) or try to find out that LR where the option is NOT Cannot be determined.Try to utilize first 10 mins to find the sets which you have to solve and spend rest 50 mins on solving. Solve at least 4 and at max 6 which can fetch u 100 percentile. If you don’t find any relevant material solve previous mock papers as they are the best source one can get.3)QA-The section which is the favorite of all engineers. There can be two strategies.a)Learn shortcuts- There are shortcuts for most of the questions. If you know the shortcuts you can reduce time on few questions and utilize it for other questions. One should be able to easily solve 25+ questions/34 in CAT as per the standard of CAT 2017.b)gain speed via practice- Practice so much that you know the approach of most of the questions. If you know the approach you will not find any new question in the CAT exam and even if you don’t know the shortcut, if you know how to solve that question, you can solve sufficient number of questions with almost 100 percent accuracy.For those who have already appeared once:You people know your strengths and weakness.Work on your weakness and never forget your strengths. Your strength is going to take you to the target.Manage both. Start taking mocks as soon as possible because you already know the syllabus.Hope it helps.","Start by starting! It is a lot like learning how to swim.You can refer to hundreds of books and videos on ‘how to swim’ but you need to take that dive to start learning!Take that dive - take a mock!More specifically, these are some pointers you could refer to for starting your cAT Preparation:Test the waters - Try your hand at a few mocks, take out some questions from online sources and take your sweet time to solve them. Try to hit as many as 30 topics from QA and LRDI, and try your hand at the Verbal section as well. After this exercise, you will know where you stand - strengths and weaknesses. You can take a look at CATKing Mock Series to start with.Theory for weaknesses, shortcuts for strengths- All your efforts should now be focused on learning theories and concepts to clear out doubts in weak areas, and finding shortcuts and tricks to save time on your strong areas. Test each theory/shortcut you are learning with a mock. Little by little, bring your weaknesses to your strengths side, and your strengths to super strengths.Deep analysis of mocks - Even though you were already analysing mocks, this stage will require careful analysis of sequencing of answering questions, the logic behind right answers, the logic behind wrong answers and determining how you could have approached the exam better. Question-by-question analysis is just short-term correction, look at the overall exam to find out what you could have done better. Leaving questions is a niche art, master it.Lastly, I would suggest you to attend this free CAT Workshop. But remember, the sooner you dive in, the faster you’ll learn! Good luck.","Preparation StrategyThere are no hard and fast rules that one can crack CAT if they start preparation very early. Some of them with just 2 months of rigorous preparation have been able to pull it off. Yes indeed. If you start early, you will have lots of time and can prepare with ease. If not, then it could be pretty strenuous but still you can pull it off provided that you have the sheer determination to do it so.Focus on the Basics/Fundamentals.Then increase the pace and also the level of your preparation.I have explained some simple strategies which you can effectively follow;Simple strategies but could prove to be very effective:Please follow 20 mins strategy. Prepare seriously for 20 mins and then give a small break. Break depends as you can take a 1 min break to an hour. It solely boils down to you. With this strategy, even if you prepare for 10 times a day (10 x 20 mins = 200 mins = 3hrs 20 mins); then you would be able to put in 3hrs and 20 mins of valuable effort. More importantly, you will not have any starting problem as some students struggle to even start.Further, keep yourself fit by doing meditation, yoga and exercises like walking, running etc to keep yourself fit. Staying fit helps you in enhancing the body & mind and in turn helps in increasing the concentration level.Have a clear goal for your preparation. Work everyday with a plan. Systematic and consistent preparation helps you a lot. More importantly, learn it with passion. If you learn with passion, then you can enjoy studying and not creating self inflicted unwanted stress.Clear Plan and GoalI come across students at times who say that they want to do this and that and so on. Have a clear plan, stick onto your goal and learn with passion. You can then achieve what you want.Self Study or Joining Online/Classroom CoachingOne always has an option to go in for self study. But that requires a high level of self motivation, sheer hard work and lots of time to understand the concepts.In turn, if you join coaching institute, it really helps you as you get to learn from the expert faculty in respective areas and it helps you to save a lot of time, as understanding concepts can take time. Further, you tend to learn tips, strategies and short cuts from the faculties.Further for preparation, student can choose online coaching. But then, the rigor of online and classroom coaching definitely differs. Coaching institutes play an important role in imparting strategies and giving a systematic structure to the student.Other than this, student should be sincere to classes and must put the best effort as their is no substitute for hard work.Factors to be Considered for Classroom CoachingIf someone has to choose coaching institute, then the factors to be considered are1) Faculty profiles (that also include qualifications) [In my opinion, that's one of the most important factor],2) Small class size i.e Faculty : Student Ratio (Even this is a very important factor) [It is still fine if the class size is slightly large provided that very good faculties handle the class]3) Materials,4) Online Test Series (Since most of the exams are online),5) Training for Written Ability Test & Personal Interview,6) Post Counselling [To help students to choose the best of the B-Schools]Online test series, training for interviews, post counselling etc will be missing if you were to prepare on your own. It’s not how early you start or you prepare in a rush with few months to go, the most important thing is that you enjoy the journey & learn it with passion and work hard with clear goal of getting into the top B-Schools no matter what.Take Mock TestsFurther, take lots of Mock Tests (after your preparation) and do a lot of self analysis after each and every test. Through this, you would be able to analyze your strengths and weakness. More importantly, you will not repeat the same mistakes again.NOTE: SIGN Consulting has created a mark in the field of CAT Coaching because of it’s rigor and for the individual attention given to each & every student.

CAT,How should I prepare for CAT 2018 if I am starting from now?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-prepare-for-CAT-2018-if-I-am-starting-from-now,"CAT 2018 Aspirant, CSE 2018 Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",100+,"Strategy for CAT preparation could vary significantly from person to person depending on your current abilities and in general, there is no one size fits all strategy that you could refer to. In this answer I will try to write a comprehensive guide assuming an average initial level in all the 3 sections namely VA, DI-LR & QAQuantitative Ability:Probably the favorite section for engineers. A big chunk of CAT aspirants tend to overestimate their skills in this section (including myself in my first attempt when my percentile turned out to be lowest in QA among the 3 sections). Preparation of Quant largely involves two parts, concept and speedConcept:Focus on building your fundamentals first. Solve basic questions from all the topics that you struggle in, don’t time your attempts initially, what matters now is learning and accuracy. Make sure to not leave out any topic, people generally tend to leave out numbers or geometry and put all their time in solving algebra problems or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your prep. Remember to get an access of 99+ percentile in Quant, you need to solve around 28/34 questions (based on recent CAT papers) and leaving out entire topics would not help your cause.Material: Any good textbook or coaching class material should be enough for studying fundamentals. You can also checkout few good Youtube channels.You should ideally be done with the fundamentals of all the topics by July 31st, latest by 10th of August.Speed:Once you have a good grasp on the fundamentals, you can work on building up your speed. Here’s where it gets tricky, simply mugging up tables, ratios, squares and cubes would do little good. The idea is to be able to develop the skill to solve a question without using old school methods.This could involve solving questions using option elimination, rough estimation, logical guesswork etc.But then how do you develop this skill. The answer, as trivial or stupid as it may sound is that you need to stop solving questions using the straight forward, lengthy original methods. Instead, try to solve it using a different, shorter method, try using the options, if the options are numerically far apart try to estimate the range of the answer, just avoid old school!!! (Can’t stress this enough)You can find good examples of how this could be done in the link below:Getting better at CAT QuantBased on observation, for developing speed, questions that are present online (based on your test series) tend to be better than questions in standard textbooksResult: You will notice that you might not be able to find a shortcut in roughly 80% of the questions. But the skill you develop and the amount of time it will save on the remaining 20% will make a huge difference. To illustrate, you will be able to solve around 7 questions in under 45 seconds each as opposed to the average 1.8 to 2 minutes. This gives you roughly 8 to 9 minutes extra in the paper, which could be the difference between a 97 percentile and a 99.5 percentile in Quant.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:A high initial ability is a big plus in this section. But even if you are not very good at verbal in your current stage of preparation, significant improvements can be made that can potentially take you beyond the 99 percentile mark in VA-RCFirst and foremost, if your current level in VA-RC is average you need to solve atleast one Reading Comprehension set every single day. There are no shortcuts here. This worked wonders for me. There are two things you need to focus on while you solve RCs viz. Reading speed and thought flow of the author. I stress on reading speed because it is essential that you are atleast able to read and give a fair attempt to all 34 questions. That’s not going to happen if you take 9 minutes to read an RC.Analyse each RC that you solve. Gradually time your attempts. Every time you read, try and step into the author’s shoes , try to comprehend the reason behind why the article was written in the first place. This will help you tons in those tricky summary and tone of the passage questions. Do not mark options haphazardly, read each answer option carefully, compare it to the context and your understanding of the passage and then attempt. Do not take accuracy for granted. High accuracy does wonders in the VA sections and for that matter all the 3 sections.If you are facing problems in understanding passages and see yourself getting direct questions wrong, then it might be a good idea to go back to basics, invest time there.Moving from direct questions to inference based questions, this is a bit tricky and it’s slightly hard to directly write a guide for this but remember the trick is to be able to see the passage as a logical flow of ideas and not a discrete collection of sentences. When you are able to connect each passage with the next and are able to draw out a logical story where the sum is greater than the parts, you should be able to do fairly well in Inference based questions. So focus on understanding each idea in the passage and how they connect to each other.Be patient, do not lose heart if you don’t see improvements in 5–6 days. You will notice significant difference in a month but stick to the 1+ RC a day formula. You will notice you are able to read faster which will save considerable time.Moving on to Verbal Ability,Again this is a section where improvement takes time, there is no easy way. Tracking your improvement could be even more challenging, since the improvements are gradual.So like every other section, continous practice is the way to go. Spend some time in understanding solutions for questions that you do not get right in the first go. Analysing these questions will significantly boost your skills in VA over time.You can follow the points below for different types of questions in VASummary type questions: Mark 3–4 important points or take-aways in the passage, check all the options for the one which has the most points present from what you have markedOdd-one out: First identify atleast two sentences that would be part of the passages, some sentences would obviously form a pair. See what the common theme is, check if the theme is not present in any of the options or if any of the options cannot not precede or succeed or fit between the pair you have selected, that should be your answer (Obviously, easier said than done)Para-jumbles: Absence of answer options can make these types of questions very tricky. As mentioned in the previous type, start with identifying any of the following if apparent: mandatory pair, obvious opening statement, obvious concluding statement. Build the connect from there onData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:Seeing the difficulty level of this section for the past 3 years, it’s now probably the make or break section in CAT. If you have taken past CATs or seen the questions, you will know what I am talking about.The good part is most people fail to do well in this section not because they are not prepared but either because their strategy is flawed or because they panic on D-day.I will come to the exam strategy part for all the 3 sections later in this answer, let’s first cover how you should prepare for DI-LR.One DI and one LR set every single day (if your current level is average then this is a must do). Do not directly start with practicing CAT level sets, start with basic questions. Once you are comfortable with that, move on to the intermediate level questions. After a few weeks of practice do a few easy sets again and see if you are able to solve them in under 5 mins. That’s the real trick to acing the DI-LR section. It’s not about how hard problems you are able to solve but more about how fast can you solve the easy level questions so that you can devote a fair amount of time to doing the medium level sets on D-Day.Solve all the standard type of sets including arrangements, tournaments, blood relations type questions in LR though there is close to 0% chance that any of these would come in the actual CAT, they will help you build your reasoning skills. Now when you move to the not so standard types, the way you approach them is try to map out a path in your mind that goes from what is given to what you need to find. Sounds vague but trust me it will help. You will get better at it with practice.In DI as mentioned in the QA part , have a strong grip on ratios and percentages. Fast calculations will help you do the direct questions (quite rare these days) quickly. For the non-direct ones, well again it will only come with practice. But the general approach is the same as mentioned, try to map out a way from given to what is to be found.All in all, probably the most important take away for this section is practice, practice and more practice.Bonus: The CAT Writer this blog helped me a lot during my preparation. Make sure you go through all the relevant articles in itCAT-holics This blog covers almost all Quant topics with solved problems. The questions covered in it are better (utility-wise) than what you will find in most books. Certainly a must do!Few general points:Do not panic at any point during the exam, remember, if you find the paper difficult, others are probably feeling the same. So, focus on getting max questions rightSimilarly, do not get carried away if you think the paper is easy. The worst thing you can do is get complacent mid-examYour preparation should ideally peak in September through mid October, do not exhaust yourself in the last two weeks before the test, it will do you no goodMake sure you subscribe to atleast 2 good test series, do not miss tests and analyse all the tests that you give, attempting alone without doing a post result analyses is practically uselessLastly, CAT could be a dicey exam. Do not lose heart if you are not able to do well because of some reason. It's not the end of the worldI will keep editing the answer as and when I remember more pointsFor strategy on how to attempt the CAT on D-Day you can refer to Gautam Oswal's answer to What could be the best strategy for attempting CAT paper?All the Best!Special credits: Tony Xavier","CAT is an online comprehensive entrance exam for MBA pursuits. It is a gateway, an opportunity to study in the most prestigious and brilliant colleges. It comprises of 3 sectionsQuantitative Aptitude, this one is all about elementary level of maths. You all need to revise and practice them thoroughly.Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation, this one is all about your common sense, logic and analytical skills. You should also work on your calculations and arithmetic skills to excel in this section.Reading Comprehension and Verbal ability, this section is all about your grammatical and reading skills. So, if you have been an avid reader in your school time it will benefit you but if you do not then start reading novels and newspaper right now.As, you are planning planning for CAT 18 you have ample of time to prepare and instead of rushing through the course hurriedly you can go for in-depth study plan preparing smoothly all through out. Each of these sections consist of various sub-topics and concepts that you need to prepare rigorously. As a result you will easily able to attempt any question in the exam. As said, ‘Practice makes man perfect’, you need to follow the same rule. You have to practice a lot and you can too. Give mock and solve past papers they are extremely significant and integral part of CAT preparation.You can even join a classroom or online program for expert guidance. I feel online program is much more convenient and easy to follow up if you are working simultaneously . A excellent and a leading online program for CAT aspirants is HANDA ka Funda .HANDA ka Funda’s online program provides the best preparation for CAT. From explaining basics to solving doubts it provides a round a clock assistance in everything. It has more than 750+ videos for concept understanding along with solved examples on each of them to learn their applicability. It gives you access to discussion forums where you can discuss your queries with other students and Ravi Handa sir as well. He also conducts live sessions on weekends to personally clear your problems and doubts.For more information you can visit this link: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams","A quick intro to my credentials:VARC: 79.94(99.63 percentile)LR-DI: 40.62(98.14 percentile)QA: 73.76 (98.95 percentile)Overall scaled score 194.32 (99.74 percentile)I'll try to answer assuming you have only a little knowledge of QA, LRDI , VARC. First of all, and this is very important, you should know the reason why you are attempting the CAT. Why I am saying this is that most people don't know what they are doing and why are they doing so. It is necessary to know your reason and use it to work hard.There are a lot of education institutes that help students prepare for CAT, but I would recommend TIME because their classroom programme has really helped me step up my game. In addition to that TIME’s study material covers basics very well. A very important thing here is to give AIMCATs or mock CATs to understand where are you lagging, what kind of mistakes are you making, how to remedy those mistakes, which areas to skip(do not think one too early), how can you improve your accuracy , uniqueness of these questions - repetitive or new concepts or a new dressing on the same concept. This will also help you know your forte which instills a new confidence(helpful many a times…lol). Take a note of your mental state too. Jot down these things in a diary or keep them in mind.Now let us delve into the specific subjects:VARC:Read newspapers: Make it a habit to read Economic Times daily or Business Standard. I would recommend Economic Times because it provides with a wide range of news from diverse topics. Use this to improve your reading speed (focus on accuracy not on speed), comprehension and to build up a good vocabulary. You'll learn some phrasal verbs, some idioms(not needed in cat, useful anyhow) and it also helps with grammar.Wren and Martin High School English Grammar and Composition: This book has been put together specially for Indian Subcontinent. It provides ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension and other allied areas to improve English communication.Tata McGraw Hill How to prepare for VARC by Arun Sharma: An awesome book. I‘ll admit it is tough, but it helps immensely.Merriam Webster App: Play the vocabulary game. It’s addictive, fun and helping.Read books : This has been suggested invariably by all my English teachers to improve comprehension and build vocabulary but i emphasize on it because it improves medium term memory(little eroded by RCs). Not necessary though!LR-DI: I attended my classes regularly and gave mocks. I sometimes used Arun Sharma’s books 1 and 2. It is sufficient. My LR-DI section was pretty weak, but these things helped me score decently.QA: QA was my forte. But a dry spell in QA was all that was needed to trim my overconfidence. Again, I used Arun Sharma Sir’s books and have to say I was surprised at my ignorance. The tips and tricks that sir has mentioned not only improved my efficiency but also my speed.Last things last, prepare well for CAT. Focus on knowledge. Use poor results as motivation. Use mediocre results as motivation. Use good results as motivation. Maintain a healthy mental state. Take some breaks regularly. Thanks to my friends,I could keep calm. I would get anxious or stuck in self-doubt and they’d help me to regain energy. Maintain a good physical health. 30–60 minutes of brisk walking is enough. And don’t beat up yourself for anything, just try to move past it(take the lesson ans use it wisely).Disclaimer: I did all the things above, but not even to 25% levels. So keep calm and prosper.","First of all find out each and every information related to CAT, likeOpportunities after CATNo of students present in examLast year exam analysis ( At how many number, how much percentile occur)SyllabusPaper LevelMake your percentile goalAfter seen all the information then make a strategy.

CAT 2017 was my first attempt, and I scored 99.98 percentile (scaled score - 222.81). My sectionals are: VARC - 98.15 (71.07), LRDI - 99.76 (53.68), QA - 100 (98.09). My past academic record is: Class 10th - 10 CGPA, Class 12th - 95%, Grad - 77% (up to 7th semester).In the days after the CAT 2017 result got announced, I got hundreds of queries from friends, seniors, juniors and random people from across the wide internet. So I decided to post an answer on a public platform, so that it may be used by anyone wishing to excel at CAT.DISCLAIMERThis was my first attempt at CAT. I do not claim to be an expert. This answer simply lists my own views and things which helped me succeed at CAT. Different things might apply to different people.BACKGROUNDI began my preparation in August 2016, at the beginning of my 3rd year. I was a classroom student at TIME Delhi. Simultaneously I joined the Facebook group iQuanta (Log into Facebook | Facebook), which was a group for like-minded CAT aspirants. I think iQuanta played the biggest role in my preparation. Even when I couldn't go to classes due to exams or other reasons, I kept solving questions on the group.Moreover, I was pretty good at Maths and English ever since my school days, owing in most part to JEE and board exam prep. This also made it easier for me to face DI sets. So basically my weakest section when I started out was LRDI, and especially LR.Initially, I spent most of my time strengthening the QA section, often neglecting the other sections. This became a problem for me once the mock season started because even though I was doing well in QA and VARC, my LRDI scores were lagging far behind. Another reason was that I had no defined strategy for LRDI, and hence I often went haywire if I had to face a difficult set. So August 2017 onward, I spent most of my time on LRDI, solving questions and developing my own strategies.I did not spend much time studying from books. I've always believed that practice is the best form of preparation. So I invested most of my time in doing practice questions and giving mocks, and as I said solving questions on iQuanta. Giving mocks is probably the most important thing one has to do in their CAT preparation. It prepares you for all sorts of possibilities.IMPORTANCE OF COACHINGI took coaching. I was part of the classroom course at one of the most renowned institutes. And personally, I’ve come to feel that classroom coaching is not necessary for CAT. There are amazing web courses available like iQuanta, at a fraction of the price of the classroom courses. The best strategy for an aspirant would be to take 2 mock series from renowned institutes, 1 booklet series, and then make use of any one web course. I’ve myself found iQuanta (CAT Preparation - IQuanta) to be the best in their domain.SECTION WISE STRATEGYSo keeping that background in mind, here are some tips and tricks, advice and suggestions, that helped me get a high score. Keep in mind that no trick is a substitute for hard work. Each and every aspirant would have one or two strong sections, and the other not-so-strong or weak sections. If it is your strongest area, make it your fort. No matter how difficult the questions, they shouldn't be able to budge you.VARC - This looks like it is the easiest section, and often it is. After all, we've all learned English all through our education. But it isn't. And for most people, it is really difficult to differentiate between an easy, and a tricky section.To improve at VARC, the first step is to improve your reading speed. Because you cannot do well in this section unless you can go through all 34 questions. So read a lot. Any source whatsoever. Prefer to use diverse sources to improve your domain knowledge of various fields at the same time. Quora is a wonderful resource, use it.Most of the practice that one needs for this section can be gained from mocks, and you can improve immensely if you work hard.LRDI - This is the weakest section for most, if not all aspirants. And frankly speaking, there is no book or mock series available that can prepare you for CAT level LRDI. But what can prepare you is having a good strategy.My strategy was that even before starting with the first set, I read all of the 8 sets, and set a priority order in which I was going to attempt them. This usually takes about 5-6 mins, but that time is worth spending. In a CAT-like situation, with a tough LRDI section, while others got stuck in tougher sets, I raced ahead and did not have to worry at any moment.Also, read and try to understand wide-ranging business scenarios. Over the last couple of years CAT has moved on to very practical scenarios in its questions (restaurants, ticket reservation etc.), and if you can understand the underlying logic, it becomes easier to solve the set.QA - Probably the one section where you have the highest likelihood of increasing your score. The score in this section often differentiates a 99.5 percentiler and a 100 percentiler (about 30 marks differentiate them).The QA section is where the Facebook group iQuanta helped me immensely. Any aspirant who isn’t a member of this group, must join immediately. I started solving doubts from other people in this group, and I really enjoyed doing it. And because of that, I was introduced to a huge variety of questions that I might never have faced otherwise.The strategy for a good QA section is to have sound basics. So if anyone is struggling with basics, start with NCERT textbooks. Because if you have good basics, you'll be able to visualize each and every problem, and would often be able t predict what the question setter is going to ask, even before reading the entire question.CONCLUSIONAt last, just remember that CAT isn't a difficult exam. It is just testing some core skills and nothing advanced. Just push yourself with the mantra, ""If I can't, then no one can"".","When you’re talking about the CAT (regardless of whether its CAT 2017 or 2018 or 2019) and the strategy one needs to crack the exam, there are two major questions which you need to ask yourself.1. How comfortable are you with the three (QA/DI-LR/VA) sections which are a part of the exam?This is an important question, perhaps more important than any question you might answer in the actual exam. That’s cause the spectre of sectional cutoffs means that you have to be ‘good’ in all three sections, or at the very least ‘good’ in two and passable in one. A weakness in one section will prove fatal for your entire examination.2. What is your background? and how expressive are you as a person?The story of the GEM with 99+ percentile who could not convert a good b school is so oft repeated now that its become a bit of a cliche at this point .Educational background is immensely important here. Additionally, a good CAT percentile is not the be all-end all of the B school journey. Getting selected in the high pressure environment of a GD/PI is a different ball game altogether. You’ve probably heard of enough people with good percentiles who choked when it came to expressing themselves on the ‘big stage’ so I won’t try to scare you with their stories at this point.In my opinion, what you need is a comprehensive guideline on how to crack the exam. Not only do you need an entity which can help you get a good percentile in this exam, you’ll also need someone to help you become more expressive and capable of handling pressure during the Interview/GD process.This ‘entity’ I’ve spoken about could be anyone. It could be a teacher, a mentor, a friend, a coaching institute …anyone who can help you perform the dual tasks of cracking the exam+cracking the GD/PI process.For this purpose, I would suggest Breakspace (Breakspace | Home). A picture is worth a thousand words, and this effectively conveys all I have to say about this institute.The rest I leave to your intelligence and discretion.","THANKS for A2ACommon admission test can be cleared by having good aptitude, English. If you dont have, you can learn, practice and get a good CAT Score.The first thing you need to do is have a unshakable belief that you can ace the CAT because you will see lots of ups and downs in these few months so it’s really important to not to loose focus.Do not stress yourself too much with the preparation. Do not imprison yourself with the preparation plan alone. Spend time doing your favorite activities too.Hard Work is the key to success!Stick with this strategy throughout your preparations and success will follow you. Believe in your strategy and more importantly in yourself.Next you need is a strategy or a game plan for next few months. No one can tell you whats the best way to prepare for for you but there are some basic guidelines which will help you find your way.You have so much time before you take the shot .One thing i will suggest you is read,read and read!! Read Hindu editorials,international newspaper and make your opnion on the national ,international issues and more importantly work more on your overall profile including extracurricular and acads (as you are still in college)Before you start full fledged preparation , I will suggest you to take an diagnostic testfor CAT(or past year paper) to know where you stand in terms of level of your Maths,English ,LR/DI .Quantitative Aptitude and Data Interpretation: Practice is the key here. There are hardly any topics which take more than 2 hours to complete. But without practicing it is as good as nothing.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension: Read. Read. Read. Reading is the exercise for brain and just any other muscle you need workout to improve its capability. Take up reading as your favorite pastime. Try to read extensive opinionated / argumentative articles from good sources viz. British magazines, English newspapers, etc. Not only should you read it fast, but also understand how the writer flows the article and reaches a conclusion.Offline coaching brings in the benefit of being disciplined by the schedule. You are pulled up for missing classes and the home work, recommendations for the next week or fortnight keeps you going.In case you want to join any coaching Institute, I will suggest you to join KITABEE , It has maximum students clearing CAT exam in terms of Percentage. Very qualified faculty.For any aspirant, the following factors are of prime importance when it comes to joining a coaching institute:1. [math]Personal[/math] [math]attention[/math] - I think the most important factor is this. If personal attention and mentoring is missing, don't join. When you are evaluating institutes, go and check their classrooms for batch size. Ask for a demo session, if possible. Go and take a demo class you will realize why i am suggesting KITABEE.2.[math] Faculty[/math] - In addition to point 1, look for faculties who have gone through the whole process as they can understand you better and guide you better. Ask for faculty details. See if you can talk to them. According to me “[math]Neeraj[/math] [math]sir[/math]” is the best teacher just call him and ask any doubt if you have. [math]7838804491[/math], 9718375475, 9540897459.3. [math]Content/Material/mocks[/math] -At KITABEE content is getting frequently updated to match the recent trends. As I said, not a differentiating factor. Mocks used to be a differentiating factor, go and visit Kitabee Site.In KITABEE you will get ample of materials to practise. There will be regular classes and after the completion of the class you will be given handouts which will comprise of the same thing taught in class . You should manage your time so well that you should practise every material. The study material are designed in such a way that it matches with CAT level. Believe me if you just do the study material religiously you will surely score more than 90 percentile. Besides that you will be given sectional tests which will be little advanced . And then comes the NEERAJ SIR’S AIMCAT.Clearing your doubts is another important thing to follow every timeKitabee focuses even on other exams like IIFT, SNAP, NMAT, XAT etc and regular mocks and revision sessions help the students perform better in these exams as each and every exam is a different ball game and needs a different strategy to excel.As the number of students is less there is a personal bond between the students and the mentors and this makes the faculty members very much approachable. Neraj Sir and Pratik Sir are a constant source of motivation for the students and help them work harder and harder.This pic was uploaded by Kitabee on Facebook …KITABEE WILL HELP YOU IN ANALYZING ……….What are your areas of strength? For Example, Quant is your area of strength. Jolly Good!! Which subjects do you excel in Quant. Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry ?? Make sure you score cent percent in them. What are your areas of weakness?? Probability. Make sure you learn the basics to exploit the low hanging fruits.What are your areas of weakness? For example, VA (verbal ability). Which parts do you score in VA. Synonyms/Antonyms, Paragraph reading, Sentence corrections. Awesome!! Concentrate only on these areas and make sure this is enough to cross the line.Enroll for a test package.Give each test as if it the d-day. Determine time allocations as per your comfort. I generally follow 30–30–30–10 rule. 30% of time per each section to cross the line and final 10% of time to maximize my score.Your preparation doesn't end here. It starts now. After each test, go through each answer diligently. This helps you evaluate your strengths and weakness.For example, you fumbled with Data sets. Great!! Go back to basics. Read and solve everything you can lay hand on for the next one week. Your aim for the next test should be zero mistakes in Data sets.On a normal basis, your All India percentile in these tests is more or less your upcoming CAT score unless you somehow achieve super powers on the D-day and perform exceedingly well.Believe in yourSELF AND IN KITABEE ……!Aren’t you convinced yet. Well, that’s how I made it during my CAT being an average student, from an average college.And its a separate ball game altogether, if you are talking about GDPI.All the best!! Work smart, bell the CAT!!RegardsRahul"

But the most crucial traits that one must possess in order to prepare effectively for CAT are discipline, consistency and a never say die spirit. Cracking CAT is not about the three hours in the examination hall answering questions, but months of rigorous practice, sleepless nights and an indomitable spirit to fight it till the end.It is a test of one’s endurance, intellect and temperament. If you are able to maintain your composure throughout the journey, you will eventually be able to ace it. You need to have nerves of steel and an inextinguishable fire to excel at CAT.The CAT preparation strategy and study plan that aspirants must followThere’s no tailor made one size fits all study plan for CAT. It has to be customised according to one’s strengths, weaknesses and limitations, which will vary with every aspirant. But what I strongly advise candidates, is to be consistent. You must spare two-three hours every day for CAT preparation. I believe that at least 8-10 months of extensive preparation are required for a candidate to score a phenomenal percentile. Target to finish off the entire syllabus by August end or September first week.Then focus on the most important aspect, taking mocks and thoroughly analysing them. LRDI and Reading Comprehension need to be practised every day as these are sections that can be mastered only with regular practice and persistence.How is Kitabee different in its approach, when coaching aspirants for CAT?Kitabee is an institution that offers personal attention to every student catering to their individual needs and helping them chalk out as well as follow a customised study plan. Each student needs varied guidance and we ensure that they are given special consideration. We are able to achieve this as the batch strength varies from 10-12 students and helps us give each student the focused attention they deserve.Once the syllabus is over, the students go through rigorous training for the next three months with frequent revision sessions, workshops and mock tests to give them the thrust they need to perform exceptionally well on the D-day. Also, at Kitabee, every entrance exam is given equal importance and we train our students accordingly to excel in each such exam.The phenomenal results of our last batch speak great volumes about the quality of training that we impart to our students. Also keeping an affordable fee structure allows everyone to join Kitabee and get access to the exceptional coaching and learning.But in the end it all depends on the efforts you put in.All the best!KITABEE - 011-49124686","IIM CAT has now confirmed the CAT 2018 dates.

Take mock tests in an online environmentThis is really important and one should ignore it, Take the computer-based mock test so that you are familiarised with the actual test environment. Also, by taking the computer-based mock test, it helps you to prepare and save any wastage and you will be able to learn many tricks of how to solve the questions, which type of questions to opt first.Tip #2. Analyse Mock TestThe next thing to do is to analyze the mock test. It is more important than taking the mock test itself. After every CAT mock test, you must analyze your performance and evaluate your scoring areas.Shiv Raj secured 99.94 percentile in CAT and is an IIM Calcutta student, shares the preparation tipWHENEVER YOU TAKE A MOCK TEST, ASSESS NOT ONLY THE WRONG QUESTIONS BUT ALSO THE RIGHT ONES. SOMETIMES YOU MAY SCORE VERY HIGH, WHILE ON OTHER OCCASIONS YOU MIGHT GET A LOW SCORETip #3. Identify your strength and weaknessYou can not improve unless you don’t know what you are doing wrong or what is your strength or weaknesses. After every mock test, evaluate your performance, identify your weak areas, focus on it and start working on that.Tip #4. Practice Every DayThe experts suggest that you must practice a lot so that you can make an instant connect with the question during your CAT exam day. Practicing regularly will not only help you increase your question-solving speed but will also make you habitual to sit for three hours.Chhavi Gupta, CAT 2017 100 Percentile shares,“I RIGOROUSLY PRACTISED THE MOCK CAT SERIES, SELECTED SOME RANDOM TESTS ONLINE AND SAMPLE CAT.

I’ve myself found iQuanta (CAT Preparation - IQuanta) to be the best in their domain.SECTION WISE STRATEGYSo keeping that background in mind, here are some tips and tricks, advice and suggestions, that helped me get a high score. Keep in mind that no trick is a substitute for hard work. Each and every aspirant would have one or two strong sections, and the other not-so-strong or weak sections. If it is your strongest area, make it your fort. No matter how difficult the questions, they shouldn't be able to budge you.VARC - This looks like it is the easiest section, and often it is. After all, we've all learned English all through our education. But it isn't. And for most people, it is really difficult to differentiate between an easy, and a tricky section.To improve at VARC, the first step is to improve your reading speed. Because you cannot do well in this section unless you can go through all 34 questions. So read a lot. Any source whatsoever. Prefer to use diverse sources to improve your domain knowledge of various fields at the same time. Quora is a wonderful resource, use it.Most of the practice that one needs for this section can be gained from mocks, and you can improve immensely if you work hard.LRDI - This is the weakest section for most, if not all aspirants. And frankly speaking, there is no book or mock series available that can prepare you for CAT level LRDI. But what can prepare you is having a good strategy.My strategy was that even before starting with the first set, I read all of the 8 sets, and set a priority order in which I was going to attempt them. This usually takes about 5-6 mins, but that time is worth spending. In a CAT-like situation, with a tough LRDI section, while others got stuck in tougher sets, I raced ahead and did not have to worry at any moment.Also, read and try to understand wide-ranging business scenarios. Over the last couple of years CAT has moved on to very practical scenarios in its questions (restaurants, ticket reservation etc.), and if you can understand the underlying logic, it becomes easier to solve the set.QA - Probably the one section where you have the highest likelihood of increasing your score. The score in this section often differentiates a 99.5 percentiler and a 100 percentiler (about 30 marks differentiate them).The QA section is where the Facebook group iQuanta helped me immensely. Any aspirant who isn’t a member of this group, must join immediately. I started solving doubts from other people in this group, and I really enjoyed doing it. And because of that, I was introduced to a huge variety of questions that I might never have faced otherwise.The strategy for a good QA section is to have sound basics. So if anyone is struggling with basics, start with NCERT textbooks. Because if you have good basics, you'll be able to visualize each and every problem, and would often be able t predict what the question setter is going to ask, even before reading the entire question.CONCLUSIONAt last, just remember that CAT isn't a difficult exam. It is just testing some core skills and nothing advanced. Just push yourself with the mantra, ""If I can't, then no one can"".","When you’re talking about the CAT (regardless of whether its CAT 2017 or 2018 or 2019) and the strategy one needs to crack the exam, there are two major questions which you need to ask yourself.1. How comfortable are you with the three (QA/DI-LR/VA) sections which are a part of the exam?This is an important question, perhaps more important than any question you might answer in the actual exam. That’s cause the spectre of sectional cutoffs means that you have to be ‘good’ in all three sections, or at the very least ‘good’ in two and passable in one. A weakness in one section will prove fatal for your entire examination.2. What is your background? and how expressive are you as a person?The story of the GEM with 99+ percentile who could not convert a good b school is so oft repeated now that its become a bit of a cliche at this point .Educational background is immensely important here. Additionally, a good CAT percentile is not the be all-end all of the B school journey. Getting selected in the high pressure environment of a GD/PI is a different ball game altogether. You’ve probably heard of enough people with good percentiles who choked when it came to expressing themselves on the ‘big stage’ so I won’t try to scare you with their stories at this point.In my opinion, what you need is a comprehensive guideline on how to crack the exam. Not only do you need an entity which can help you get a good percentile in this exam, you’ll also need someone to help you become more expressive and capable of handling pressure during the Interview/GD process.This ‘entity’ I’ve spoken about could be anyone. It could be a teacher, a mentor, a friend, a coaching institute …anyone who can help you perform the dual tasks of cracking the exam+cracking the GD/PI process.For this purpose, I would suggest Breakspace (Breakspace | Home). A picture is worth a thousand words, and this effectively conveys all I have to say about this institute.The rest I leave to your intelligence and discretion.","THANKS for A2ACommon admission test can be cleared by having good aptitude, English. If you dont have, you can learn, practice and get a good CAT Score.The first thing you need to do is have a unshakable belief that you can ace the CAT because you will see lots of ups and downs in these few months so it’s really important to not to loose focus.Do not stress yourself too much with the preparation. Do not imprison yourself with the preparation plan alone. Spend time doing your favorite activities too.Hard Work is the key to success!Stick with this strategy throughout your preparations and success will follow you. Believe in your strategy and more importantly in yourself.Next you need is a strategy or a game plan for next few months. No one can tell you whats the best way to prepare for for you but there are some basic guidelines which will help you find your way.You have so much time before you take the shot .One thing i will suggest you is read,read and read!! Read Hindu editorials,international newspaper and make your opnion on the national ,international issues and more importantly work more on your overall profile including extracurricular and acads (as you are still in college)Before you start full fledged preparation , I will suggest you to take an diagnostic testfor CAT(or past year paper) to know where you stand in terms of level of your Maths,English ,LR/DI .Quantitative Aptitude and Data Interpretation: Practice is the key here. There are hardly any topics which take more than 2 hours to complete. But without practicing it is as good as nothing.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension: Read. Read. Read. Reading is the exercise for brain and just any other muscle you need workout to improve its capability. Take up reading as your favorite pastime. Try to read extensive opinionated / argumentative articles from good sources viz. British magazines, English newspapers, etc. Not only should you read it fast, but also understand how the writer flows the article and reaches a conclusion.Offline coaching brings in the benefit of being disciplined by the schedule. You are pulled up for missing classes and the home work, recommendations for the next week or fortnight keeps you going.In case you want to join any coaching Institute, I will suggest you to join KITABEE , It has maximum students clearing CAT exam in terms of Percentage. Very qualified faculty.For any aspirant, the following factors are of prime importance when it comes to joining a coaching institute:1. [math]Personal[/math] [math]attention[/math] - I think the most important factor is this. If personal attention and mentoring is missing, don't join. When you are evaluating institutes, go and check their classrooms for batch size. Ask for a demo session, if possible. Go and take a demo class you will realize why i am suggesting KITABEE.2.[math] Faculty[/math] - In addition to point 1, look for faculties who have gone through the whole process as they can understand you better and guide you better. Ask for faculty details. See if you can talk to them. According to me “[math]Neeraj[/math] [math]sir[/math]” is the best teacher just call him and ask any doubt if you have. [math]7838804491[/math], 9718375475, 9540897459.3. [math]Content/Material/mocks[/math] -At KITABEE content is getting frequently updated to match the recent trends. As I said, not a differentiating factor. Mocks used to be a differentiating factor, go and visit Kitabee Site.In KITABEE you will get ample of materials to practise. There will be regular classes and after the completion of the class you will be given handouts which will comprise of the same thing taught in class . You should manage your time so well that you should practise every material. The study material are designed in such a way that it matches with CAT level. Believe me if you just do the study material religiously you will surely score more than 90 percentile. Besides that you will be given sectional tests which will be little advanced . And then comes the NEERAJ SIR’S AIMCAT.Clearing your doubts is another important thing to follow every timeKitabee focuses even on other exams like IIFT, SNAP, NMAT, XAT etc and regular mocks and revision sessions help the students perform better in these exams as each and every exam is a different ball game and needs a different strategy to excel.As the number of students is less there is a personal bond between the students and the mentors and this makes the faculty members very much approachable. Neraj Sir and Pratik Sir are a constant source of motivation for the students and help them work harder and harder.This pic was uploaded by Kitabee on Facebook …KITABEE WILL HELP YOU IN ANALYZING ……….What are your areas of strength? For Example, Quant is your area of strength. Jolly Good!! Which subjects do you excel in Quant. Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry ?? Make sure you score cent percent in them. What are your areas of weakness?? Probability. Make sure you learn the basics to exploit the low hanging fruits.What are your areas of weakness? For example, VA (verbal ability). Which parts do you score in VA. Synonyms/Antonyms, Paragraph reading, Sentence corrections. Awesome!! Concentrate only on these areas and make sure this is enough to cross the line.Enroll for a test package.Give each test as if it the d-day. Determine time allocations as per your comfort. I generally follow 30–30–30–10 rule. 30% of time per each section to cross the line and final 10% of time to maximize my score.Your preparation doesn't end here. It starts now. After each test, go through each answer diligently. This helps you evaluate your strengths and weakness.For example, you fumbled with Data sets. Great!! Go back to basics. Read and solve everything you can lay hand on for the next one week. Your aim for the next test should be zero mistakes in Data sets.On a normal basis, your All India percentile in these tests is more or less your upcoming CAT score unless you somehow achieve super powers on the D-day and perform exceedingly well.Believe in yourSELF AND IN KITABEE ……!Aren’t you convinced yet. Well, that’s how I made it during my CAT being an average student, from an average college.And its a separate ball game altogether, if you are talking about GDPI.All the best!! Work smart, bell the CAT!!RegardsRahul"

CAT,How can I start my CAT prep for 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-start-my-CAT-prep-for-2018,"CAT Preparation 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",18,"Well the answer depends on whether you have appeared earlier in the exam or not.For freshers:1)VARC-start reading novels/newspaper editorials or few online websites on a daily basis.There are 3 main question types that you need to focus upon:a)Reading comprehension(RCs)-You can’t crack CAT until you have a strong hold on this section. For initial stage read diverse subjects and try to comprehend what the author wants to convey. Then start practicing from books of any coaching material. I would suggest TIME.Also take sectional tests.b)summary and para completion-Relatively the easiest part of VARC section where you should have very high accuracy.Practice frm same coaching material and take sectional tests.The options may not be accurate but you need to select the relatively most accurate option.c)Para jumbled and odd one out-odd one out is again an easy part but para jumbled is one of the difficult parts of CAT since there are no options given. You need to have enough practice of reading and solving these questions to get them correct but I would suggest to leave them anyway.Overall VARC is one of the most scoring sections in CAT as the paragraphs are not very hard to comprehend. The only problem is the options which are too close and one should be very good at elimination.2)LRDI-Most of the people find this section difficult but I never faced such issue. I will discuss my strategy. Hopefully it will help. There is no separate strategy for LR and DI. If there is a proper DI question with no logic required(Data based) solve it right away because you don’t need to solve all the questions in DI. just try to solve 4 sets out of the 8. Then try to solve the LR which is your strength(Sudoku type for me) or try to find out that LR where the option is NOT Cannot be determined.Try to utilize first 10 mins to find the sets which you have to solve and spend rest 50 mins on solving. Solve at least 4 and at max 6 which can fetch u 100 percentile. If you don’t find any relevant material solve previous mock papers as they are the best source one can get.3)QA-The section which is the favorite of all engineers. There can be two strategies.a)Learn shortcuts- There are shortcuts for most of the questions. If you know the shortcuts you can reduce time on few questions and utilize it for other questions. One should be able to easily solve 25+ questions/34 in CAT as per the standard of CAT 2017.b)gain speed via practice- Practice so much that you know the approach of most of the questions. If you know the approach you will not find any new question in the CAT exam and even if you don’t know the shortcut, if you know how to solve that question, you can solve sufficient number of questions with almost 100 percent accuracy.For those who have already appeared once:You people know your strengths and weakness.Work on your weakness and never forget your strengths. Your strength is going to take you to the target.Manage both. Start taking mocks as soon as possible because you already know the syllabus.Hope it helps.","Start by starting! It is a lot like learning how to swim.You can refer to hundreds of books and videos on ‘how to swim’ but you need to take that dive to start learning!Take that dive - take a mock!More specifically, these are some pointers you could refer to for starting your cAT Preparation:Test the waters - Try your hand at a few mocks, take out some questions from online sources and take your sweet time to solve them. Try to hit as many as 30 topics from QA and LRDI, and try your hand at the Verbal section as well. After this exercise, you will know where you stand - strengths and weaknesses. You can take a look at CATKing Mock Series to start with.Theory for weaknesses, shortcuts for strengths- All your efforts should now be focused on learning theories and concepts to clear out doubts in weak areas, and finding shortcuts and tricks to save time on your strong areas. Test each theory/shortcut you are learning with a mock. Little by little, bring your weaknesses to your strengths side, and your strengths to super strengths.Deep analysis of mocks - Even though you were already analysing mocks, this stage will require careful analysis of sequencing of answering questions, the logic behind right answers, the logic behind wrong answers and determining how you could have approached the exam better. Question-by-question analysis is just short-term correction, look at the overall exam to find out what you could have done better. Leaving questions is a niche art, master it.Lastly, I would suggest you to attend this free CAT Workshop. But remember, the sooner you dive in, the faster you’ll learn! Good luck.","Preparation StrategyThere are no hard and fast rules that one can crack CAT if they start preparation very early. Some of them with just 2 months of rigorous preparation have been able to pull it off. Yes indeed. If you start early, you will have lots of time and can prepare with ease. If not, then it could be pretty strenuous but still you can pull it off provided that you have the sheer determination to do it so.Focus on the Basics/Fundamentals.Then increase the pace and also the level of your preparation.I have explained some simple strategies which you can effectively follow;Simple strategies but could prove to be very effective:Please follow 20 mins strategy. Prepare seriously for 20 mins and then give a small break. Break depends as you can take a 1 min break to an hour. It solely boils down to you. With this strategy, even if you prepare for 10 times a day (10 x 20 mins = 200 mins = 3hrs 20 mins); then you would be able to put in 3hrs and 20 mins of valuable effort. More importantly, you will not have any starting problem as some students struggle to even start.Further, keep yourself fit by doing meditation, yoga and exercises like walking, running etc to keep yourself fit. Staying fit helps you in enhancing the body & mind and in turn helps in increasing the concentration level.Have a clear goal for your preparation. Work everyday with a plan. Systematic and consistent preparation helps you a lot. More importantly, learn it with passion. If you learn with passion, then you can enjoy studying and not creating self inflicted unwanted stress.Clear Plan and GoalI come across students at times who say that they want to do this and that and so on. Have a clear plan, stick onto your goal and learn with passion. You can then achieve what you want.Self Study or Joining Online/Classroom CoachingOne always has an option to go in for self study. But that requires a high level of self motivation, sheer hard work and lots of time to understand the concepts.In turn, if you join coaching institute, it really helps you as you get to learn from the expert faculty in respective areas and it helps you to save a lot of time, as understanding concepts can take time. Further, you tend to learn tips, strategies and short cuts from the faculties.Further for preparation, student can choose online coaching. But then, the rigor of online and classroom coaching definitely differs. Coaching institutes play an important role in imparting strategies and giving a systematic structure to the student.Other than this, student should be sincere to classes and must put the best effort as their is no substitute for hard work.Factors to be Considered for Classroom CoachingIf someone has to choose coaching institute, then the factors to be considered are1) Faculty profiles (that also include qualifications) [In my opinion, that's one of the most important factor],2) Small class size i.e Faculty : Student Ratio (Even this is a very important factor) [It is still fine if the class size is slightly large provided that very good faculties handle the class]3) Materials,4) Online Test Series (Since most of the exams are online),5) Training for Written Ability Test & Personal Interview,6) Post Counselling [To help students to choose the best of the B-Schools]Online test series, training for interviews, post counselling etc will be missing if you were to prepare on your own. It’s not how early you start or you prepare in a rush with few months to go, the most important thing is that you enjoy the journey & learn it with passion and work hard with clear goal of getting into the top B-Schools no matter what.Take Mock TestsFurther, take lots of Mock Tests (after your preparation) and do a lot of self analysis after each and every test. Through this, you would be able to analyze your strengths and weakness. More importantly, you will not repeat the same mistakes again.NOTE: SIGN Consulting has created a mark in the field of CAT Coaching because of it’s rigor and for the individual attention given to each & every student.

I registered for almost all MBA related exams with the money i had made by working odd jobs. MAT came, I still don’t even know the syllabus or anything, tried to do some 20 questions, answered most others with ‘intuition’(apparently, there is no negative marking-i’m not even sure of that now). I marked many and came out without any thinking, then started collecting notes for CAT. I decided i wont spend on any coaching. I studied basics for around 10–15 days and October was here. Then i started receiving mails from several colleges regarding MBA admission. My dumb ass had forgot about MAT results. I got calls from BIMTECH, LIBA, BIMM, ALLIANCE etc, so many except TAPMI and XIME(the only good colleges i knew which accepted MAT). Then i had the inner calling to check MAT score. 95 percentile. I didn’t understand what percentile was. I spend an entire evening googling percentile, composite score, what a good score is etc. Finally it dawned-MAT was cracked. But i was no more interested in MAT.I started studying for CAT. I searched for inspirational videos to motivate me. Few friends did this actually. Then i started getting up at 4 daily, study till 7, breakfast at my study table while i watch a video on quant/Rc or so, then at 8, restart till 11. Then lunch, a good sleep for 2 hours, restart at around 4–5, take a few breaks, then from 6 to 11 including 1 hour break for dinner and stuff. I had hardly 50 days and had to do same effort as people with 6 month effort because I had to reach their effort level since i wasn’t a scholar or something. I stopped going out of room as such, junk food was stored so i can save time instead of going out and buying(too much ik), dark chocolate, almonds, glucose, etc were 1 feet from me, i had it right before studying. I spent every single rupees i had earned by the end of this. I knew this wasn’t good, because I’m not a genius, i needed more time to understand something and most likely needed the steps to understand most questions.For those who say you can crack CAT in 2 months, don’t generalize. There are many like me who aren’t cracking a question right after reading it. It may take 5 reads to understand the meaning alone. We need more time. We are not the typical geniuses you mention who crack in 2 months.I took 11 mocks in total, with maximum mark of 80 and minimum of 19. But i wasn’t bothered about it, i was more about how to attempt them. My RC was my advantage. I got 50–60 in RC alone. So a quick calculation told me i need just 5–6 in LRDI and 10–15 in quant to get a decent score. And guess what? that’s exactly what i scored- 23 correct in VARC, with 3 wrong, 6 correct in LRDI with 2 wrong, 15 correct in quant with 3 wrong. I got calls from baby IIMs, SPJIMR, MDI and even IIM I. And yes I converted 3 of them- MDI, SPJIMR and the IIM i am in now…at Indore XD.P.S- the high accuracy was not because of my hard work- most was narrowing down to 2 options and choosing one hoping it would be right. Ik it’s not a good thing, but i am no Buddha to follow complete righteousness or so.I answered this question because I’m a middle-back bencher, never scored anything worth telling at all. I passed every exam, but never passed even with average marks. So this is a huge achievement for me.","I decided to take CAT in 2016. I already had a work experience of 2.5 years and I realized that this year was my do or die situation. Because, by the time I again appear for the CAT next year, I would already be having a work experience of 4 years which would not provide me the edge anymore. So according to me, this was my first and last shot.Now as you know, when you have your back up against the wall, you become desperate and you do anything. Same was the case with me. I was working and my job profile demanded full attention for 10-11 hours. That left me only with 2-3 hours to study. So I left all the beauties of life and chose a life of a workaholic nerd. I used to return home a 10 pm from office. Within one hour, I hurriedly changed, swallowed food and went to bed by 11-11:30 p.m. I still remember those days when I used to crave for having dinner with my family but had to eat early as I need to wake up early the next day and start preparing for CAT. I woke up around 7 a.m. the next day and started solving problems from all the books and materials that I had gathered. By 10 a.m., I used to wrap up everything and leave for office.If you think I was done for the day, You are deeply mistaken!! I took the full advantage of commuting for 1-1.5 hours (one way). I had installed various apps and I solved the VARC section while going to the office. Luckily, that section did not require pen-paper, so it was easier for me to have a look at that section while travelling to office. While returning from office, I used to go through the daily news so that it would help me in the WAT/PI process.I didn’t leave a single opportunity to study in the office as well. When my team members were busy taking a puff or gossiping over lunch, I used to have my lunch at desk, pouring over online Quant problems.The weekends were even more difficult. While most of my friends and colleagues enjoyed, went on dates and watched movies, I used to either attend coaching classes or lock myself in the room taking mocks. I took 2-3 mocks every weekend and I spent the rest of my week analyzing the mocks. For an entire one year, I seldom went out with friends. Yes, for a few people and occasions I do made an exception, but like I said, they were literally few.Luckily, all these paid off and by god’s grace, I am today a member of the IIM family. Being a working professional, without the dedication that I showed, I would not have been able to reach an IIM today. So my advice to you would be: work hard for just a year. You would be able to reap the benefits for the rest of your life. Believe me, you would not want to miss out on being a part of the IIM family and the huge network of the eminent B-schools. A few movies on the weekends are nothing in front of what the other side of the table has to offer to you. Trust me, if you show dedication, you would not regret it. Ever.Hope this helps.All the best!","This one pic brings back 1000 memories for me and accurately describes my dedication during that period.This is me revising QA on a construction site in North Africa during lunch break (With my helmet in the background).The Story - Location - Oran, Algeria (About 8000 km from India)I was working as a Construction Engineer in Algeria in 2015 when I first decided to write CAT. Now, as some of you might know, the work of an On-Field Construction Engineer is pretty extreme both mentally and physically. For me, it used to be about 12 hours a day, 6 days a week and that too on-the-site itself.I started my preparation on May 21, 2015, totally clueless about CAT. But once I decided to write it, I ensured to give at least 2–3 hours every day. EVERY SINGLE DAY. (Except for a few days before flying back to India to write CAT). Initially, it was so damn difficult as I used to be super-tired after the field work but not for a single day did I not study. I was starting from scratch, and I had to go ALL IN. I had to leave no stone unturned. It really was NOW OR NEVER for me.It was all the more challenging as this was going to be my first CAT attempt and I had no books, notes or any other direct medium to study from. Most of my preparation was through reading articles online, Pagalguy threads, or mock tests. I also had some pretty amazing friends from Pagalguy with whom I used to discuss (Mohit Jain & Ganesh Nagarsekar were also among them).I would study in whatever way I can on my way to/from office (using Mobile/Notebook). During lunch, I would finish eating in 10 mins so that I can use the remaining 50 mins for studying (The above pic is me studying during my lunch break). Any free time I found during the day, be it for 15 mins, I would do something or the other that would help in some way. (Most of the time, using my mobile as I loaded it up with articles, bookmarks, and even mock test papers that I have already written but the analysis was remaining).[I preferred to study on the site instead of the office as the breeze used to be amazing. This pic below shows my under-construction site and the above pic was while I was sitting inside one of these floors. You can see the Mediterranean Sea in the background!]Now that I think about those days, I may as well say that I might have been possessed and was pretty crazy at times!Heck, I wrote a full mock test on my 6-hour long flight from Algiers to Dubai and ended up analyzing it as well! (This was about 14 days before CAT when I was flying back to India)These 6 months & 7 days were the most amazing days of my life as I can confidently say that I gave all I had in me during this period.The result day… well that’s a story for another time :-)never_settle"

You'll be lucky to get a call.I'm one of the GEMs in the list above.Aim for XAT/GMAT/MDI or max FMS via CAT if your acads are bad.I can only imagine how the others in the list must be feeling right now. It hurts because CAT exam have so many tuitions and mock series and what not crap. It's so overhyped that people forget that it's just a filtering criteria(you're just a number on the excel sheet bro) and nobody cares once you get a call(apart from XLRI MDI FMS). I and the others might not have been as good as we could've been,but I'm cent percent sure we didn't do that bad to be waitlisted in 200s or be direct rejects.It's just effort down the drain. I'm not trying to be a spoilsport but just giving you the truth- truth that nobody told me. Truth that these so called experts with 20+ years of experience in the industry don't tell you because they know if they tell you that you have a slim chance of a call even with 99.8+ you'll never join since it'll become too much of a gamble. Greed at its very best. Seriously you guys,the hell?The argument that “if you know that you can't get a call with a high percentile will you stop studying? No right?” Is the shittiest argument I've ever heard. 99.8+ requires efforts and thorough mock analyses,at least for regular people. I'm not one of those brilliant people who study 1 hour a day for 2 months and crack CAT. So yes, I for one probably wouldn't have if I knew I needed 99.95 for an Ahmedabad call and that even a 100 wouldn't have gotten me a Bangalore call. I would've used my energy and time somewhere else productively.TL;DR NO.I wish I could see recordings of converts and rejects and compare. Feel like absolute crap.Rant over.PS: Funny story- 93%ile SC-E-M - Converted ABC. Go figure.","No.We Indian students are a terribly hardworking breed. Once put our minds to anything, it doesn’t stand a chance. Look at the ever increasing scores in all exams across the world. All conquered. So when someone starts to feel bugged by their engineering coursework(majority aspirants) and having a knack for cracking exams, they get to know about CAT. Another MCQ based paper that delights the best of us given its nature and the level it is tested on. True feline.You enroll, prepare, appear, ace and end up with a number. That number is just to get a call. It does not even appear in the interview application form(so the panel does not know if you are a 100%iler or a 98-only in ABC). Also, you can’t write it in your CV once inside IIM.What remains? Interview, Written Test(called WAT/AWT) and maybe GD. So CAT isn’t the actual D-Day, your interview day is.People say that there is some weightage for CAT as well in the final selection. It’s usually 30%. Without even normalising(as some institutes might do and which you must know reduces the difference of scores further), let’s just say they divide your CAT score by 10. So if you got 220/300 in CAT, you get 22/30 in final composite score. Makes sense?Look at the other side of the picture now.220 was 99.98%ile this year.100% was 230+99% was ~17299.6% was ~185(close to AC cutoffs)Now calculate their weightage individually.100%ile→23+/30(Mind you, only 20 people across the country, highest being 27.5)99.98%ile→22/3099.6%ile→18.5/3099%ile→17.2/30See what the difference between a 100 and a 99(a difference of 2000 ranks btw) amounts to in the final score? Barely 6 marks. Reduces to 4 if you are 99.95.Point being-CAT does not guarantee anything. In the anonymous answer below, I personally know many people in that list being one myself.I was curious as to why such high CAT score couldn’t fetch a IIM-B call. Here’s what the RTI says.Note the weightages for each component:CAT-40, X-20, XII-10, UG-20, Workex-8, Diversity-2My scores:X-94.43(661/700)[ICSE], XII-93.6(468/500)[ISC], UG-70.4%, CAT-99.98(219.81/300), Workex-0So it’s not that you need to have “poor” acads to not even get a call. I was the district topper in 10/12 and an average(not poor) lad in UG. But no call still. Learn this-they seek impeccable, not good. Outliers do exist though.This answer is absolutely not intended to demotivate anyone. I knew about these facts from the start and yet gave it a shot. But many people remain oblivious of the reality. It’s better to know the consequences before building castles in your mind. Some motivation? For same number of people getting rejected, there are a few getting selected as well. But then there are those courageous souls who, even after getting 99.9+ retake CAT multiple times to get in just ABC(in a few cases, just A). So it all depends on your risk taking ability. Just keep a fair idea of where you might land up. I for one always knew about no B call. And was comfortable joining any of ABCLKI(though later mind started to think about retaking CAT). But then realised that having made through once doesn’t mean I could get a call always(tremendous luck needed). So accepted my place in the normal distribution curve.Goodluck!","The answer to this question is no. The most important thing to get an admission in a B-school is how much do you score in CAT, and not how much did you prepare.Even if you crack the CAT, your admission would depend a lot upon the college which you seek an admission into.For a lot if colleges, yes, you can get an admission as soon as you have crossed a particular percentile score in CAT (assuming that you have applied/will apply for that institute) and have higher percentile than the cut-off for the institute for that year.For most (almost all) of the tier-1 B-schools in India, the answer to, if you will get an admission even if you have a high CAT percentile, is “NO” . In fact, cracking the CAT is just half the journey covered.Most of the top B-schools, give individuals calls for the further rounds based on their past academic scores, work-experience and CAT score (gender and academic diversity play a role in getting calls too). Once one has received a call, s/he has to undergo one or more of the following process rounds:WAT (Written Ability Test),GD ( Group Discussions), andPersonal InterviewThe weightage allotted to these rounds for most of the top B-schools is very high. For some institutes it is as high as the CAT score and in some cases even more than the CAT score. Hence, performing equally well in all of these rounds is as important as performing well in the CAT. A final composite score is then calculated separately for every individual and based on the occupancy of the college for that year, final admission are given.To learn more about the WAT, GD and PI rounds conducted across institutes and how to excel at them, I recommend you to watch the video linked. CAT WAT, GD, PI video.Hope this helps.All the best.","Thanks for the A2A Rounak.It depends on the company you are sitting for. Ideally for mass recruiters like CTS, TCS, Infosys etc,CAT prep is more than enough. Generally you can get through the apti round pretty easy, the problem is with the technical interview.So in case you have a good enough preparation for CAT, don't think about the Aptitude round and rather concentrate on the coding skills.:)"

You may convert it at less but the safest is 99+.Now coming to my experience, I started preparing for CAT in 3rd year of my engineering, but I was never serious so I ended up missing a lot of classes and was very irregular. Ended up scoring less. Decided to give CAT another attempt and this time promised myself to be serious about it.After my engineering, I didn't take up a corporate job (had an offer). Instead I started working with my father in our family business and was preparing for CAT alongside.I will share my daily routine with you:I used to go to work at 10am and return by 5pm or 6pm.After that from around 7 or 8 I used to start studying till 1 or 2 am.I used to give one section test of RC consisting 3 RC passages daily. This was mainly because I was weakest in VA-RC. I used to analysed the RCs and then start with QA and DI/LR on alternate days. I am a moody person so used to study chapters based on my mood. On days when I was too tired I used to solve easy chapters.For vocabulary, in the initial firsts month I started doing 1 or 2 sessions of word power made easy by Norman Lewis and completed it.I used to give mocks mainly on weekends. Most of my weekends were spent mainly on giving a mock followed by analysing a mock.My mock analysis would give me all the chapters which I need to study in the coming week.I also followed blogs of CATking CAT Blogs and GP ka funda.You can check this study plan : CAT Study Plan It is very comprehensive and nice.You can also follow this youtube channel for more tips :Rahul CATKing Youtube ChannelLastly, I would say consistency is must!This all worked for me. Hope you benefit from some of it too!","Thanks for A2A!As you must have realised by now scoring high in CAT does not guarantee a seat in good B-schools. There are 2 things you can do now to increase your chances of getting selected:1.Improve your CAT score to score more in that component of the selection criteriaThis can be done as follows:Preparing in a structured way is what is required! I used the following approach in my prep days which worked wonders for me:Give 3–4 mocks in a proper timed mannerAnalyse all of them togetherSo analyse all the VA sections together, QA sections together and DILR sections togetherTry to see where you are continuously going wrong or missing out in each of the sectionsThose are your weak areas! Work on them in the following way:Go to the concept files/lessons, learn the conceptLearn how to apply themPractise, Practise and Practise until you have covered all the varieties of questions and are confident about the topic2–3 weeks should be good enough for each of the topics if you give 1/2 hour - 1 hour of time to these weak areas a day for each of the sectionsPost you are done with the weaknesses you can start off with your strengths - only they will take you lesser time and effortLater on post 3–4 months you should be over topic wise preps and can start off with mocks which will further solidify your confidence. However, if you do miss out on any question due to not being able to apply the concept you should go back and go through it again!2. Improve your overall profileDoing online courses pertaining to your interest areasFocus on your job - Be informed about what, why and how you are doing the work you are doing!Join an NGOReading about your interest areas - happenings, key trends, practises, etc.Research on which domain do you want to pursueBeing up-to-date with what is happening in the worldAll this will help you get ready for the GDPI processes of various B-schools and will help you ace them!You can have a look at the following online courses which are exhaustive in terms of coverage, provides flexibility and includes mentorship:CAT 2018 CourseCAT 2018 Mock Series","Thanks for A2A RohitHi students!I remember a BE senior of mine could not convert any IIM after getting approx 99.7 in CAT long back in 2007. Perhaps he did not have the right confidence and frame of mind going into the BLACKI PI rooms. Last year a student of mine could not convert any IIM despite scoring 98.5+ in CAT. So, first thing first - it happens. Now, the reason behind this is lack of the right mentorship or exposure. Understand exposure and guidance come to those who seek. So, here goes my suggestion for next year:Try scoring >92 in CAT. 92 is a very tricky score for the range of colleges that call at that score. IMI, IMT, IRMA,MDI etc. etc. all get most students in the range 88–95. To be on the safer side, try getting 95+. That makes things easier for you.Now, coming to the profile part. Make sure your resume looks a clear picture of who you are. Create buckets of whatever achievements you have got till now. Note down the positions of responsibilities that you have held till now. Prepare your projects and subjects well and go into the PI round as an informed and sorted individual who knows all that he has done in life till now.Be clear on why do you want your hand to fit in the glove. Lots of students miss the bus because they are not able to link their profile to the college and or stream that they are applying for. Read blogs, sites related to management and build a clear perspective on why MBA and why you think you are good for pursuing MBA? CAT score is not the answer for this - interest in exam itself is also not enough - interest in management has to developed. Your MBA personality has to be nourished right from now. So read, follow and enjoy management stuff in life right from now. Believe that you belong!Believe in yourself. Last time was an experience, this time will be performance! Bounce back with 100% confidence. You will do it then.Best wishesRahul SirCAT Prep with IIM A alumni","To be honest it is not all that surprising that one isn’t able to convert a decent B-school through CAT at 92 percentile.To get calls from the older IIMs (ABCLIK) a percentile around/above 99.xx along with having a strong academic history is required. For the 2nd generation IIMs, a percentile above 97 percentile with decent profile shall fetch you calls. For 3rd gen. IIMs (baby IIMs), with a good overall profile you may get calls if you are anywhere above 95 percentile in CAT.So, what can you do to avoid this fiasco?Well, a lot. Start with preparing a study plan for yourself and follow it religiously. Initially brush up on all the basic concepts before moving on to the sectional or full course MockCATs. If you think you are in need of external help, join a coaching institute as soon as possible.Once you are done with the basics, you may take sectional or topic based tests. As you get accustomed to these sectional tests, move towards full course mock CATs. Analyze the results of these mock CATs in depth, to identify your strengths and weaknesses to work on them.Start reading novels, newspaper editorials and business magazines to improve on your vocabulary and reading skills.As most B-schools also give certain amount of weightage to your profile including academic history and work-ex you might want to try and get a job. Having work-ex on your CV will not only provide you the additional points which are allotted for work-ex but will also give you topics and experiences from job to discuss with the interviewer.You might also find this answer of mine helpful: Siddharth Ganthade's answer to What should be my daily routine if I want to crack the CAT 2018?Hope this helps.All the best."
CAT,Why should one prepare for CAT? ,https://www.quora.com//Why-should-one-prepare-for-CAT,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",13,"Going anonymous, since I don’t want my office colleagues know that I am preparing for CAT.This is my CAT story. I gave CAT 2017 and scored 99.48%ile. Thanks to my General Engineering Male status didn’t get a call from ABCLI. Also , I could not convert my IIM-Kozhikode and FMS calls. Am I dejected? Hell yeah. Will I try again? Hell Yeah.I am giving CAT ’18 full aware that I need 99.98%ile at least, to get a call from IIM-A due to my low graduation scores. I know for the fact, that I might not get a call from IIM-B even after scoring 100%ile.At this point I want to say that I work in a reputed product company with a handsome package and a very good work life balance.So what drives me to work even hard to prepare for this exam. Plenty of reasons actually.An MBA from an IIM opens up a whole new window of opportunities ranging from Strategy Consulting to Investment Banking to Marketing. This is a big break away for me from moving from 1 technology stack to another. An MBA thereby opens up a lot of industry verticals.The 2 years of management education instills in an individual the rigour, versatility and persistence to survive in the management world. The most important take away we get from the top IIMs is time management. Loads of assignments with inflexible deadlines forces an individual to prioritize and manage time.2 years of corporate experience has made me aware of the importance of networking. Imagine being in a group of 400 top minds across the country, from different background and different experience level. This combined with the fact that the best management teachers would be teaching you. This makes striving to get into an IIM worthwhile.How do I know all this. online student experiences and interaction with my friends who are in IIM has helped me understand the importance of the top IIMs.Hope to make the cut in CAT 2018. :)Any suggestions are welcomeEDIT: Thanks for your comments. Sorry, could not reply earlier. Got busy in some other things.Some of you wanted to know my acads: 10th - 92%, 12th - 81.5% and BTech: 73%Kushagra Sahai : If you are in your 2nd year, the most valuable thing that you can do is improve upon you academics. It carries a lot of weight when IIMs roll out the calls.Pranav Ingale I would not say that they are not good. But to leave a high paying product company for new IIMs could not be justified.Logging off quora until CAT 2018. Hope I can remove my anonymity after CAT ’18 ;)","That is how life is.I scored a 100 %ile in 2010, and yet did not get a call from IIM-Indore. Upon inquiring, they told me that as per their criteria, I did not make it to the top 1600 candidates who were selected for interviews.I have 90+ in both 10th and 12th, and a 7+ GPA. Nothing stellar, but nothing really bad too. Moral of the story: The shortlisting and selection criteria isn't that straightforward.It is common sense that someone would look at and evaluate the eligibility criteria for interviews before even preparing. It might so happen that some institute has some criteria that you already don't satisfy. All of the same are available on the institute websites.This is precisely why I advise folks to not quit their jobs to prepare for CAT or have a backup career plan (for freshers). P.S. Below are the links for the eligibility and selection criteria for the 19 IIMs. They are updated every year for the next year's process. Any prospective CAT aspirant must ensure that they go through the eligibility criteria for that year, and satisfy at least some of them.The first 7Admission Details - IIMA Indian Institute of Management Bangalore Admissions | IIMC Eligibility : : IIML Announcement - IIMK Academic Programmes - भारतीय प्रबंध संस्थान इंदौर - IIM Indore Post-Graduate Programme (PGP) Admissions at IIM Shillong The next 6 (started on or after 2010)IIM Rohtak "" AdmissionIIM Ranchi - PGDM 2016 (Criteria) IIM Raipur IIM Trichy - PGPM Admission Criteria IIM Udaipur - Post Graduate Programme | Programs | Home IIM Kashipur The final 6 (started in 2015)IIM NAGPUR IIM BodhgayaIIM-Visakhapatnam IIM Amritsar IIM Sirmaur IIM Sambalpur - भारतीय प्रबंध संस्थान इंदौर - IIM Indore","Before we start talking abut the %iles, preparation strategies & all the stuff, let's start by the paper itself!Common Admission Test (CAT)Computer Based TestTime: 180mins (60mins each for all 3 sections)Questions: 100(VA-34; LRDI-32; QA-34)Sections: Verbal & Reading Comprehension (VRC); Logical Reasoning & Data Interpretation (LRDI); Quantitative Ability (QA)All specific details as per CAT 2015 & are subject to change in future!## In general exam is conducted in the last week of November, on yearly basis!PREPARATIONWell, that depends on how you want to tackle it!Either you can enroll yourself to any classroom program or you can do self study & join any online mock series next year.In case you tag plan to along second choice, this is what you can do:Enroll to Career Launcher  & Takshzila shikshak  on YouTube!If you can devote yourself to a classroom program later on, I'll suggest you to join Career Launcher, as the mentors there will work there ass off to assist & facilitate you.Meanwhile buy any good relevant topics related books (Arun Sharma for Verbal, Quant & LRDI) n target 1 topic each every day!Also as you plan to start your prep form Feb-March, these are few things that can help you:Read a loads of good book from different areas/genres.

This will give a good insight of what happened with those who appeared in earlier years.I hope you'll be able to get most out of your preparation.All the best!","The answer is quite Simple. Another question: Why MBA?If you are anywhere close to completing your graduation or have worked in the industry for a few years and are thinking what to do next then MBA from one of the top B-schools in India would definitely have crossed your mind. So, let us cut the chase and come straight to the point. We will talk about 5 reasons why you should do an MBA and 5 reasons why people tend to be afraid of preparing for an MBA:MBA for financial Independence:We hear about the Rs. 1 crore plus salary packages that students from the IIMs get every year. Even beyond those, one can expect a package of 10-20 lakhs post an MBA from one of the top-25 B-schools in India. And mind you, these numbers are for a fresh out of B-school graduate. With a few years of work-experience the salary levels would only go higher. So, for even an average engineering graduate, MBA offers at least a 3 fold jump over his pre-MBA salary levels.MBA for growth in Career:Those of us who have worked for a few years will agree that to grow beyond a certain level in your job, you need an additional degree. Also, even as a fresh graduate you can reasonably expect a saving of 2-3 years in reaching the project manager level of profiles.MBA for greater Job options:The sheer diversity of jobs, the extent of responsibility and ownership that you get as an MBA in your job make it worth your while. You get to choose from a range of specialisations such as Marketing, Advertising, Finance, Strategy, Consulting etc. The challenges that you have as an MBA are much higher and so are the rewards for success.MBA for Job Security:If you recall the slew of recessions that have hit our country over the past 10 years and how vulnerable every job becomes, it'd help to also remember that your job as an MBA is one of the safest ones as the senior resources are relatively difficult to hire and fire.MBA for Social respect, Networking and Credibility:If you want to become an entrepreneur you will need experience in the sector of preference, and financial backing besides others. Your ability to get seed capital for starting a new business improves tremendously if you have done an MBA from one of the top B-schools in the country. You also get to interact with the best minds in the country where you can brainstorm your ideas and get a better handle on things.Ask yourself, who'd you like to be – one-in-a-hundred graduates working for a company or the one who is overseeing their performance. Let is be said that an MBA definitely provides better recognition, opportunities to network and credibility too.And if you want to do MBA from reputed institute then you will have to prepare for CAT as most of these colleges do consider CAT. Even if you don’t want to apply to IIMs then also you may have to appear for an institute specific exam and it will require a CAT level preparation."

In this answer I will try to write a comprehensive guide assuming an average initial level in all the 3 sections namely VA, DI-LR & QAQuantitative Ability:Probably the favorite section for engineers. A big chunk of CAT aspirants tend to overestimate their skills in this section (including myself in my first attempt when my percentile turned out to be lowest in QA among the 3 sections). Preparation of Quant largely involves two parts, concept and speedConcept:Focus on building your fundamentals first. Solve basic questions from all the topics that you struggle in, don’t time your attempts initially, what matters now is learning and accuracy. Make sure to not leave out any topic, people generally tend to leave out numbers or geometry and put all their time in solving algebra problems or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your prep. Remember to get an access of 99+ percentile in Quant, you need to solve around 28/34 questions (based on recent CAT papers) and leaving out entire topics would not help your cause.Material: Any good textbook or coaching class material should be enough for studying fundamentals. You can also checkout few good Youtube channels.You should ideally be done with the fundamentals of all the topics by July 31st, latest by 10th of August.Speed:Once you have a good grasp on the fundamentals, you can work on building up your speed. Here’s where it gets tricky, simply mugging up tables, ratios, squares and cubes would do little good. The idea is to be able to develop the skill to solve a question without using old school methods.This could involve solving questions using option elimination, rough estimation, logical guesswork etc.But then how do you develop this skill. The answer, as trivial or stupid as it may sound is that you need to stop solving questions using the straight forward, lengthy original methods. Instead, try to solve it using a different, shorter method, try using the options, if the options are numerically far apart try to estimate the range of the answer, just avoid old school!!! (Can’t stress this enough)You can find good examples of how this could be done in the link below:Getting better at CAT QuantBased on observation, for developing speed, questions that are present online (based on your test series) tend to be better than questions in standard textbooksResult: You will notice that you might not be able to find a shortcut in roughly 80% of the questions. But the skill you develop and the amount of time it will save on the remaining 20% will make a huge difference. To illustrate, you will be able to solve around 7 questions in under 45 seconds each as opposed to the average 1.8 to 2 minutes. This gives you roughly 8 to 9 minutes extra in the paper, which could be the difference between a 97 percentile and a 99.5 percentile in Quant.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:A high initial ability is a big plus in this section. But even if you are not very good at verbal in your current stage of preparation, significant improvements can be made that can potentially take you beyond the 99 percentile mark in VA-RCFirst and foremost, if your current level in VA-RC is average you need to solve atleast one Reading Comprehension set every single day. There are no shortcuts here. This worked wonders for me. There are two things you need to focus on while you solve RCs viz. Reading speed and thought flow of the author. I stress on reading speed because it is essential that you are atleast able to read and give a fair attempt to all 34 questions. That’s not going to happen if you take 9 minutes to read an RC.Analyse each RC that you solve. Gradually time your attempts. Every time you read, try and step into the author’s shoes , try to comprehend the reason behind why the article was written in the first place. This will help you tons in those tricky summary and tone of the passage questions. Do not mark options haphazardly, read each answer option carefully, compare it to the context and your understanding of the passage and then attempt. Do not take accuracy for granted. High accuracy does wonders in the VA sections and for that matter all the 3 sections.If you are facing problems in understanding passages and see yourself getting direct questions wrong, then it might be a good idea to go back to basics, invest time there.Moving from direct questions to inference based questions, this is a bit tricky and it’s slightly hard to directly write a guide for this but remember the trick is to be able to see the passage as a logical flow of ideas and not a discrete collection of sentences. When you are able to connect each passage with the next and are able to draw out a logical story where the sum is greater than the parts, you should be able to do fairly well in Inference based questions. So focus on understanding each idea in the passage and how they connect to each other.Be patient, do not lose heart if you don’t see improvements in 5–6 days. You will notice significant difference in a month but stick to the 1+ RC a day formula. You will notice you are able to read faster which will save considerable time.Moving on to Verbal Ability,Again this is a section where improvement takes time, there is no easy way. Tracking your improvement could be even more challenging, since the improvements are gradual.So like every other section, continous practice is the way to go. Spend some time in understanding solutions for questions that you do not get right in the first go. Analysing these questions will significantly boost your skills in VA over time.You can follow the points below for different types of questions in VASummary type questions: Mark 3–4 important points or take-aways in the passage, check all the options for the one which has the most points present from what you have markedOdd-one out: First identify atleast two sentences that would be part of the passages, some sentences would obviously form a pair. See what the common theme is, check if the theme is not present in any of the options or if any of the options cannot not precede or succeed or fit between the pair you have selected, that should be your answer (Obviously, easier said than done)Para-jumbles: Absence of answer options can make these types of questions very tricky. As mentioned in the previous type, start with identifying any of the following if apparent: mandatory pair, obvious opening statement, obvious concluding statement. Build the connect from there onData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning:Seeing the difficulty level of this section for the past 3 years, it’s now probably the make or break section in CAT. If you have taken past CATs or seen the questions, you will know what I am talking about.The good part is most people fail to do well in this section not because they are not prepared but either because their strategy is flawed or because they panic on D-day.I will come to the exam strategy part for all the 3 sections later in this answer, let’s first cover how you should prepare for DI-LR.One DI and one LR set every single day (if your current level is average then this is a must do). Do not directly start with practicing CAT level sets, start with basic questions. Once you are comfortable with that, move on to the intermediate level questions. After a few weeks of practice do a few easy sets again and see if you are able to solve them in under 5 mins. That’s the real trick to acing the DI-LR section. It’s not about how hard problems you are able to solve but more about how fast can you solve the easy level questions so that you can devote a fair amount of time to doing the medium level sets on D-Day.Solve all the standard type of sets including arrangements, tournaments, blood relations type questions in LR though there is close to 0% chance that any of these would come in the actual CAT, they will help you build your reasoning skills. Now when you move to the not so standard types, the way you approach them is try to map out a path in your mind that goes from what is given to what you need to find. Sounds vague but trust me it will help. You will get better at it with practice.In DI as mentioned in the QA part , have a strong grip on ratios and percentages. Fast calculations will help you do the direct questions (quite rare these days) quickly. For the non-direct ones, well again it will only come with practice. But the general approach is the same as mentioned, try to map out a way from given to what is to be found.All in all, probably the most important take away for this section is practice, practice and more practice.Bonus: The CAT Writer this blog helped me a lot during my preparation. Make sure you go through all the relevant articles in itCAT-holics This blog covers almost all Quant topics with solved problems. The questions covered in it are better (utility-wise) than what you will find in most books. Certainly a must do!Few general points:Do not panic at any point during the exam, remember, if you find the paper difficult, others are probably feeling the same. So, focus on getting max questions rightSimilarly, do not get carried away if you think the paper is easy. The worst thing you can do is get complacent mid-examYour preparation should ideally peak in September through mid October, do not exhaust yourself in the last two weeks before the test, it will do you no goodMake sure you subscribe to atleast 2 good test series, do not miss tests and analyse all the tests that you give, attempting alone without doing a post result analyses is practically uselessLastly, CAT could be a dicey exam. Do not lose heart if you are not able to do well because of some reason. It's not the end of the worldI will keep editing the answer as and when I remember more pointsFor strategy on how to attempt the CAT on D-Day you can refer to Gautam Oswal's answer to What could be the best strategy for attempting CAT paper?All the Best!Special credits: Tony Xavier","CAT is an online comprehensive entrance exam for MBA pursuits. It is a gateway, an opportunity to study in the most prestigious and brilliant colleges. It comprises of 3 sectionsQuantitative Aptitude, this one is all about elementary level of maths. You all need to revise and practice them thoroughly.Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation, this one is all about your common sense, logic and analytical skills. You should also work on your calculations and arithmetic skills to excel in this section.Reading Comprehension and Verbal ability, this section is all about your grammatical and reading skills. So, if you have been an avid reader in your school time it will benefit you but if you do not then start reading novels and newspaper right now.As, you are planning planning for CAT 18 you have ample of time to prepare and instead of rushing through the course hurriedly you can go for in-depth study plan preparing smoothly all through out. Each of these sections consist of various sub-topics and concepts that you need to prepare rigorously. As a result you will easily able to attempt any question in the exam. As said, ‘Practice makes man perfect’, you need to follow the same rule. You have to practice a lot and you can too. Give mock and solve past papers they are extremely significant and integral part of CAT preparation.You can even join a classroom or online program for expert guidance. I feel online program is much more convenient and easy to follow up if you are working simultaneously . A excellent and a leading online program for CAT aspirants is HANDA ka Funda .HANDA ka Funda’s online program provides the best preparation for CAT. From explaining basics to solving doubts it provides a round a clock assistance in everything. It has more than 750+ videos for concept understanding along with solved examples on each of them to learn their applicability. It gives you access to discussion forums where you can discuss your queries with other students and Ravi Handa sir as well. He also conducts live sessions on weekends to personally clear your problems and doubts.For more information you can visit this link: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams","A quick intro to my credentials:VARC: 79.94(99.63 percentile)LR-DI: 40.62(98.14 percentile)QA: 73.76 (98.95 percentile)Overall scaled score 194.32 (99.74 percentile)I'll try to answer assuming you have only a little knowledge of QA, LRDI , VARC. First of all, and this is very important, you should know the reason why you are attempting the CAT. Why I am saying this is that most people don't know what they are doing and why are they doing so. It is necessary to know your reason and use it to work hard.There are a lot of education institutes that help students prepare for CAT, but I would recommend TIME because their classroom programme has really helped me step up my game. In addition to that TIME’s study material covers basics very well. A very important thing here is to give AIMCATs or mock CATs to understand where are you lagging, what kind of mistakes are you making, how to remedy those mistakes, which areas to skip(do not think one too early), how can you improve your accuracy , uniqueness of these questions - repetitive or new concepts or a new dressing on the same concept. This will also help you know your forte which instills a new confidence(helpful many a times…lol). Take a note of your mental state too. Jot down these things in a diary or keep them in mind.Now let us delve into the specific subjects:VARC:Read newspapers: Make it a habit to read Economic Times daily or Business Standard. I would recommend Economic Times because it provides with a wide range of news from diverse topics. Use this to improve your reading speed (focus on accuracy not on speed), comprehension and to build up a good vocabulary. You'll learn some phrasal verbs, some idioms(not needed in cat, useful anyhow) and it also helps with grammar.Wren and Martin High School English Grammar and Composition: This book has been put together specially for Indian Subcontinent. It provides ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension and other allied areas to improve English communication.Tata McGraw Hill How to prepare for VARC by Arun Sharma: An awesome book. I‘ll admit it is tough, but it helps immensely.Merriam Webster App: Play the vocabulary game. It’s addictive, fun and helping.Read books : This has been suggested invariably by all my English teachers to improve comprehension and build vocabulary but i emphasize on it because it improves medium term memory(little eroded by RCs). Not necessary though!LR-DI: I attended my classes regularly and gave mocks. I sometimes used Arun Sharma’s books 1 and 2. It is sufficient. My LR-DI section was pretty weak, but these things helped me score decently.QA: QA was my forte. But a dry spell in QA was all that was needed to trim my overconfidence. Again, I used Arun Sharma Sir’s books and have to say I was surprised at my ignorance. The tips and tricks that sir has mentioned not only improved my efficiency but also my speed.Last things last, prepare well for CAT. Focus on knowledge. Use poor results as motivation. Use mediocre results as motivation. Use good results as motivation. Maintain a healthy mental state. Take some breaks regularly. Thanks to my friends,I could keep calm. I would get anxious or stuck in self-doubt and they’d help me to regain energy. Maintain a good physical health. 30–60 minutes of brisk walking is enough. And don’t beat up yourself for anything, just try to move past it(take the lesson ans use it wisely).Disclaimer: I did all the things above, but not even to 25% levels. So keep calm and prosper.","First of all find out each and every information related to CAT, likeOpportunities after CATNo of students present in examLast year exam analysis ( At how many number, how much percentile occur)SyllabusPaper LevelMake your percentile goalAfter seen all the information then make a strategy. A person can help you to guide you only the way but you have to put the actual effort that will make the result.Begin with the end in mind:Start your preparation with sheer determination and self motivation. Whenever you Whenever you get distracted, you can dream about the day when you will crack the exam and it will definitely motivate you.Syllabus:This is a useful tip for almost any exam. Before starting you must be aware that what will ask in exam and keep a point in mind that you have to creak the exam not to do Ph.D on syllabus. You have to prepare only that part that is asked in exam. The syllabus is divided into 3 sections:Quantitative Ability (QA) [34 Questions]Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DILR) [32 Questions]Verbal & Reading Comprehension (VARC) [34 Questions]The concepts used in this examination are broadly of class 10 level but the questions are little bit tricky. To solve a paper in a given time limit it require good amount of logical thinking and lots of practice.For complete detail of syllabus you can go through my previous answer: Deepak Saini's answer to What is the syllabus of the CAT?Join coaching:It is always better to have a guide/mentor when you prepare for a competitive exam. Now the days online courses are best choice for preparation of CAT because of flexibility and affordability.Online courses when compared to classroom courses has following benefits:No wastage of time in traveling.Affordable.Durable.Flexible.24*7 access to courses.Login anytime & anywhere.Very helpful for working professionals and undergraduates preparing for CAT.Paperless study, Hence it supports Digital IndiaYou can go through the online course that may help you to boost your knowledge and preparation: Online Coaching for CAT and Banking ExamsThe features of there online CAT course are:Experienced CAT FacultyCAT Preparation Video TutorialsLive CAT Coaching ClassesTest SeriesStudy MaterialExtremely AffordableLive classes for doubt clarificationNow you need to decide what is best option for you.Test Series:Subscribe any one good test series but that test series must more difficult than actual CAT exam.

CAT,How was your CAT 2018 paper?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-your-CAT-2018-paper,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",13,"I wrote cat for the third time in a row. I had admission offers from new and baby iims but I decided to give it one more shot. The biggest blunder I had done was to leave my job. And before you read any further let me advice you not to do the same, no matter what. So, my exam was in slot 2. The day earlier I watched friends and andaz apna apna to cool down. I had given around 35 mocks, so I was pretty confident that I'm gonna nail it.On the exam day the biometric and every thing went smooth.Then starts the exam. Varc has not been my favorite, but I went there with a mindset just to clear the cutoffs. In cat 2016 I failed to clear sectional in this and had paid the price. To my surprise VA seemed pretty easy. Rc were readable but had few tricky questions with closer options. I managed to mark 24 somehow. God knows at what accuracy. I was relieved after this section as the nightmare I thought was over.Dilr is something I enjoy. I love solving puzzles. I was prepared for a tough section but to my surprise there were 2 extremely easy sets which everyone must have attempted. I cracked 4 sets in about 50 min. But got carried away while solving 5th one. And the section got locked.Qa is my forte. I've scored 99pc in qa for 2016&17 cat. And as all the IIMs were boasting about diversity and all, nearly every mock from every institute had easy qa section. Maybe that's why people are crying alot over qa. I went through the paper to find that the section is difficult. I started with round strategy but not many were lower hanging fruits. Also, the problems and calculations as well, were lengthy and took time. I managed to solve 21 questions here.Overall, I enjoyed the paper. I didn't feel as much heat as people are shouting and crying. It was a pretty decent paper. All the papers in 2002–2008 were far far difficult than this one.People got to remember one thing, if it was hard for you it will be same for everyone. In this case lower attempts could fetch you great percentile. What matters the most in this case is the accuracy.Cat 2016- 95pcCat 2017–96.9 pcEdit; Those asking aboout leaving job-yes its extremely difficult to manage prep with job in hand. but believe me when you go for an interview, they grill you based on the same. there will be many with great profiles + job experience. So, the panel will ask you if they did manage to, what was the problem in your case? until and unless you have a stellar profile or very strong reason i recommend not doing so. Maybe you can find a job where you dont have to devote full attention for the whole day.About QA- Cause I'm a mechanical engineer, and this is what we do! I mean, we may be not great readers, don't read a lot, or run very fast... but damn it, we can crunch numbers and solve QA.","My exam was in slot 1.First let me give a brief about my profile:10th | 12th | Graduation - 96% | 89.3% | GPA - 7.3Work experience - 3 years.CAT 2017 - 84.5 %ile.Now, My CAT 2018 attempts are :VARC(28), LRDI(20), QA(18)I was quite confident before the exam as i knew that i was well prepared for the exam. I had taken about 30 full length mock tests that helped me a lot to manage the time and make a guess about the difficulty level of questions.All thanx to my mock test practice, I made it a habit to spend first 5 minutes in analyzing the questions and determining the order in which i would attempt question.VARCRC were based on common topics like second world war, Consumer behavior etc. So, I didnt find any much difficulty in understanding the context of the passage. Strikingly i found the passages to be or shorter length( I was expecting long passages and had practiced alot). As the usual trend of CAT, most of the questions were based on inferences and had confusingly similar options but I was well taught the tricks to handle these question by my mentors. So, after a bit brainstorming I used to get to the correct answer.I did plastic pollution passage at first as I found it relatively easy followed by passages on world war and then consumer behavior.Verbal portion was very similar to last years paper. I didn’t find much in verbal portion worthy of talking.Overall, VARC was confusing but of moderate difficulty level.LRDILRDI portion is generally considered the toughest part of CAT exam and It proved to be the one. Even after determining the sequence in which i would attempt the section, i was stuck in the very first LR. I spend about 12 minutes there but the good part was i somehow managed to find the answers to all the questions.Overall, LRDI portion was Difficult. I talked to a lot of people at my center and most of them had attempted 15 or less.QuantsI personally felt geometry was the toughest part of QA section. IIMC maintained its legacy of setting the worst QA paper.There were a lot of NON-MCQ questions. Despite that the difficulty level of the section was touching heights. I felt the QA section was filled with Arithmetic questions. So, It became a bit lengthy also.Overall, Quants section came as a surprise to those who don’t know the trend of IIMC. We were warned about this by our mentors. So, we were on the safe side.I checked my response sheet with the answer key released by various institutes. My wrong attempts are:VARC - 2(Negative marking Ques) + 2( Non - negative/TITA)LRDI- 1(Negative Marking)Quants- 1 (TITA)These are my wrong attempts.After doing the required mathematics, I am getting 177 marks.For this score, I am quiet confident of getting 99+ percentile, rest depends on the level of competition.If you want to know about the my CAT journey and best coaching institutes for CAT visit my answer.Ayush Bhatnagar's answer to Which is the best MBA coaching institute in Delhi? How is it better than the other institutes?For any help, you can message me.Please upvote if this helps you.","100%ile aspirers can skip the answer.I gave up CAT preparation in august as I thought my preparation was going no where, my mock scores didn’t cross 100 marks and I seriously thought of giving GATE another chance. But I don’t think my giving up affected my CAT score phenomenally because of following reasons:VA/RC:I am pretty good at RC. I read books to my extent, so no problem in VARC I attempted 25 questions (Dunno about accuracy though) but I did my level best.DI/LR:The actual reason I gave up CAT because I thought DI/LR being tough and I got single digit marks and attempted questions in single digit only in mocks. So, I would not make it to 99%ile zone,so no IIM calls, so no MBA. So, I gave up and started preparing GATE but as I was in exam hall and solving sets, I had feeling that it didn’t have anything which needed stupendous amount of practice and solving all the difficult sets from mocks and books. Definitely tough section but key to success lies in finding easy sets and a medium set, so that you solve 12–16 questions correctly and you will be through. There will be no time to solve more questions than that and if somebody tells you he/she solved more than that it means they have affected their accuracy. Solve 15–18 questions with full accuracy and you will have 99%ile. I solved 13 questions.(Dunno about accuracy though). Easy sets will be time consuming.Bekar Ki Mehnat Mat KaroQuant:Definitely tough and was a very unpleasant surprise. CAT quants from 2015–17 was very easy. If you knew basic maths you could solve but this year quant had questions which needed practice (a lot of practice precisely) and if my giving up affected CAT score it was in this area. I knew after the exam that if I hadn’t given up I would have scored well. I attempted 11 questions(Dunno about accuracy though). Before attempting even one question 20 minutes elapsed and somebody was cutting onions near me because I had tears in my eyes during quant (They shouldn’t allow onions in exam hall)Thoughts for the CAT:CAT became my favorite exam as it tests intelligence rather than memory (Though You should remember few formula but it’s only few)There is no need of coaching. I took online coaching but it didn’t affect my performance.All you need for CAT exam is Arun Sharma’s book and nothing else. Please follow no other book especially for DI/LR.Certain amount of practice more than enough(2 hours per day for 5 months)Don’t give up on exam otherwise you will regret like me laterEnjoy your learning days without stressing too much and please don’t feed your mind with plethora of questions, sets and passages because if exam is tough then it will be tough for all and everybody is human like you and will work hard only as much as you are.( If you are working quite hard though)Before exam meditate by chanting OM.BANAT BANAT BAN JAI——LAHIRI MAHASAYA","Finally dream day is done …with lot of confusions, assumptions, unpredictabilty and what not.Cat 2018 slot 2 exam went like a meery round.To begin with ..1.The devil in the maskVERBAL:First ,the passages seem to be easy and not confusing. So for many the section may be easy and went peacefully. Almost everyone attempted more than 25/34.But here comes the twist…did u observe that there are lot of ambiguity and confusion while answering ,especially RC. There are 2 similar answers out of which one is correct. So don’t believe if people says this section is easy…to conclude your score in this section depends critically upon your accuracy not the number of attempts…which test takers will realize soon :)2.DILR:Verbal gave a feeling of peace ..but as you go into dilr it was a bit changing. Though it was easier than cat 2017 …still it is tough compared to other years. To my shock, there are no arrangement questions from LR, and the DI was not calculative intensive but a bit more data to interpret..means it will take more time than average to complete a set.3.Night mareQUANT:Is this even a fully solvable section..every question is mutli layered and damn time taking.R.I.P for quant 2018…i am sure it will be the toughest quant paper in cat history.So overall, for me verbal is more tricky than what people are analysing and the other sections are similar .But cat 2018 is tougher than cat 2017..I am expecting a score of 155 is enough for 99 percentile and 100–110 for 90 percentile."

I prepared for CAT while I was working. I used to leave from home by 9.30 - 10 times in morning and be back in home by 9 - 10 after dinner from work. Some days, I had to stay in office late. My work comes under the category of hectic ( mentally, not physically ). This is what I did for the written CAT exam. Spend one hour every day in the morning, going through the chapters (Apti, DI, LR). I had materials, and I went chapter by chapter some day and random questions some day. Ensured I solved 20 problems in the beginning and as I progressed the speed increased tremendously. In office, open a browser tab and go to Arts & Letters Daily . Ensured I read three articles each day before I leave office. I'm generally curious, so I would read some random things without any background. Helped a lot in RC. The Hindu, Business standard in browser tab in office. Read in between meetings, when I was distracted etc. But, utilize time in office. Along with wordweb. Everyday, walk for 20 minutes or so in the night leisurely and recite to myself all multiplication tables ( 1 to 20 )Squares of numbers, cubes of numbers Calculate % components for 1/2, 1/3 ... 1/15 Take 5 random numbers and compute their squares and cubes ( short cut ways ) I know the set of people who are preparing for CAT; we especially had a guy who is very motivated and he would provide us the problems that are challenging & we would spend time discussing quickly. Mostly casual chat types. In our office, it was appreciated to prepare for exams and hence this was easy. Weekends, I gave one mock test, either from home or test center. I would try to solve the problem after the exams ( the ones I was not able to find quick solutions for ) & see if there are options. This would be complete in the weekend itself. Overall, CAT is about being in touch with the basics. You can solve the paper if you are given twice the time. It is all about speed and accuracy. These will not come unless you are in regular touch. Allot small amounts of time every day and you will surely crack it. All the best for your CAT...!!! ","CAT is very difficult to handle with 9 to 6 job, but it has to be done. I started my CAT preparation after I completed 2 years at work and finally nailed it with 1.5 years of preparation. I have experienced how difficult it is to maintain work-life balance. Thus, preparing CAT along with work is next to impossible for many. Thus, it leads to two extreme steps. Either the aspirant leaves his job or he leaves his dream of an IIM tag.Leaving the job for CAT is too risky because of the unpredictability of the exam. If you are thinking of taking the other step, then this post is not for you. You may scroll down to read some other post.I am assuming the following conditions are satisfied to follow the steps mentioned in this post:1. Saturday & Sunday off. (Weekend off)2. Total time 12 hours outside the home. (Office + travel time + etc.)3. You have only one goal in your life and i.e. CAT.Some of you may get off on some other days or work unevenly on various days. So for the people whom the above assumptions are not valid. Please accommodate the schedule as per your ease.1. Treat each section equally: - Considering the increasing difficulty level of DI & LR with every passing year and high unpredictability of VA, do not live under the veil that you can cover one section with another. Focus on all the sections.2. Weekdays: - On weekdays allocate 6 (8-2 = 6) hrs. for studying (2 hrs. for each of the four sections mentioned below)(i) QA: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals/books. You can use any of the two mocks (IMS, Time).(ii) DI/LR: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. You can use any of the three mocks (IMS, CL, Time). Practice as many sets as you can.(iii) VA/RC: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. IMS mocks provides you the closest RC that you may get in CAT. You can practice from Time also but RC from Time is a bit lengthy and contains a bit easier question. The VA/RC section of last two years CAT was most similar to IMS mocks. You can use office time to practice old mocks, sectional, etc. (Given you utilize the time judiciously. Trust me, it is achievable.)(iv) Newspaper Reading (The Hindu Editorial): - This should be finished at the office. Do not carry this task to home. 9 to 6 job provides you enough free time to read the newspaper. If you do not get enough time during lunch or while traveling, then you can follow other alternatives. Copy the editorial/article and paste it in either XLSX or notepad and read it. This way you will be at your cubicle and can utilize your time well. Do this whenever you get free time. Don't restrict yourself to only newspaper and diversify your readings.3. Weekends/Holidays: - On weekends/ holidays allocate minimum 12.5 hrs. for studying.(i) 7.5 hrs. for studying (2.5 hrs. to each section).(ii) 3 hrs. for mock.(iii) 2 hrs. for mock analysis.4. Till August: - You should finish QA theory & formulas, all concepts of DI & LR and the basic understanding of different question types in VA & RC.5. September & October: -(i) You should only do revision and attempt mocks and sectionals.(ii) You Should give at least 2 mocks each weekend with their analysis. Do not miss any center-based mocks. Attempt them at the center to prepare yourself for the exam like scenarios. (It will make you feel comfortable on D day).6. Last month (November): -(i) 1 mock each day and along with its analysis.(ii) I would advise taking a month leave before CAT. If it is not possible then take at least 2 weeks off before the exam and give mocks at exactly the exam time.7. Meanwhile, take out time to pursue your hobbies. Keep in mind CAT is not the end, it is just the beginning of your DREAM.All the Best. Please feel free to ask any query in the comment section.To get answer of all other Query Please Join.Log into Facebook | Facebook","IT IS NOT AT ALL DIFFICULT. Period. Always keep this in mind.CAT is an exam for which you need not put in several hours of preparation daily for months. Your preparation and performance will depend A LOT on where you stand right now. If someone is comfortable with Maths, Reasoning and/or English already, the entire preparation will revolve more around developing speed and polishing the strategy with which one approaches the paper. However, CAT is not that easy either, it is not the paper that makes this exam tough but rather, the high amount of competition.Note that, the major constraint for us here is TIME. So, we’ll try and do these 2 things -Reduce investing time in unnecessary activities other than what’s really important.The time that we invest in CAT prep, it must have high RoI. (So, no reading newspapers, past papers, old mock tests etc)Keeping this in mind, these are some key points (in no specific order) which will help you in preparing for CAT alongside working -Get hold of study material from any institute and make sure that you go through at least QA and LR from start to end ASAP. This is extremely important.A very important thing (that most people don't do) is that every time you try and solve questions, do it with time limit. It will be much more effective if you get used to solving questions in time limit from day 1.Try and manage 3 hours at least on alternate days, this will be needed when you write mock tests on weekdays.Try and utilise your travel time to office for revision. Maintain a thick notebook with all the QA formulas/tricks and LR concepts/tricks and keep updating it with every mock/sectional test you give.Mental calculations are very important. Practice this all the time, even while working.Instead of investing time in novels/newspapers, invest that same amount of time in solving RC passages on various themes and topics (With a time limit of course). This way, you'll practice a lot of reading as well as you'll also practice spotting answers for questions.Take mock test very seriously, and its analysis even more seriously. Write a mock only if you’re sure that you can focus. Do not write a mock when you’re super tired or are sure that you’ll be disturbed in between. More importantly, focus a lot on the analysis part. Identify where you went wrong. Go through the solution of the test thoroughly and write all the new formulae/tricks mentioned in the ‘thick notebook’ mentioned above.Once you start mocks, maintain an excel sheet to keep track of questions in VA and QA topic wise. After every mock, during analysis, just fill this excel sheet.At the end, apply a formula that will give you details about % attempt (Attempt/Total*100) and % accuracy (Correct/Ateempt*100) topic wise. After 10-15 mocks, you'll be very clear about which topic you are attempting less, where your accuracy is pathetic etc etc. It will help you much more than you realise.DO NOT try to do too many things. Someone will try and do mocks, various books from Indian authors, even GMAT books, then lots of reading, then improve grammar with several grammar improvement books, then vocab improvement books, solving questions on Pagalguy, solving questions on various sites, various study materials etc etc etc. KEEP IT SIMPLE. Don't get caught up with all this. Don't ask for too many suggestions. Talk to a few good people, make a good plan that you feel will work for you and just do it.Maximise your efforts during the weekends, significantly reduce hanging out with friends, movies etc.STOP WASTING TIME.Trust me, it is not difficult at all. I too did it in my first CAT attempt. I had an extremely demanding on-field job as a construction engineer and was able to spare only 2-3 hours per day 6 days a week for the preparation. On Friday (Weekend in Algeria), I used to study for around 6-8 hours. As this was my first attempt, I had to start from scratch. Moreover, I didn’t have any books or materials with me to study from so I had to look for concepts and questions on the internet. All the best.NEVER SETTLE","Given the changing nature of CAT (which at a fundamental level has remained more or less the same) and the preparation required to 'crack' an exam of this kind, planning becomes extremely important in addition to the natural skillset.Considering you have taken CAT 2015, you are now aware of three things:1. Verbal preparation is not really prep prep but something that needs to be done over a long period2. Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation requires vast exposure to different kind of questions and logic(s)3. A simple formula based approach and sticking to level of difficulty 1-2-3 in Quant is good enoughAlso read: Prasad Sawant's answer to Does CAT 2015 Stands a benchmark for future test pattern?When you are taking a second attempt at a test like this, your preparation strategy is quite different from your first attempt strategy. First attempt is like learning how to swim. You flounder, you need help, your strokes are without finesse and you somehow manage to stay afloat. And unless you do that, you don't reach the next level. But once you have learned what's required, you become better. Then you focus on cutting the water at a certain angle, perfecting your strokes, increase your lung capacity and strength, and finally, you become a good swimmer.Coming back to your question, let's start planning your day:Work day: 24 hours - (9 hours of work, 2 hours of travel, 7 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 2 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 2 hoursNon-work day: 24 hours - (10 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 5 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 7 hoursAssuming you are dedicated enough, you will roughly have about 24 hours per week for preparation. This time can be divided as (Strong section: 7 hours, Moderate section: 8 hours, ""I-am-not-good-at-this"" section: 9 hours) Preparation means: Understanding concepts + solving questions without time limit/with time limit. One of the biggest mistakes before the second attempt is confusing familiarity and conceptual clarity. In the first six months of the calendar year, focus on preparation. In the remaining five months, focus on mocks and test taking strategy and practice. The reason why I am not sharing a time table and talking broadly in terms of hours is because I think everyone is different and needs to have a custom plan. Only you can draft that for yourself. The next thing is to sustain the motivation and having a discipline to stick to that plan (DIFFICULT part)Post June/July, you should not feel the need to go back to the concepts book. The idea of putting more hours in the first six months is to reduce to effort required in the second half. People start getting serious 2 months before the CAT when it's already late. Then nothing helps. Also, before you start your plan for CAT 2016, sit and do a thorough analysis of your last year preparation and performance. What different things are you going to do this time to ensure a significantly better result? Create a monthly plan which is further divided in weeks and days. Keep a little buffer in case a topic is difficult to understand or long. Extreme specificity might not be required (for e.g. morning 30 minutes on 27th January for understanding sum of roots from algebra) but a broad topic wise and section wise plan is better. Once the plan is in place, understand what material will help you achieve it. Coaching institute material + past papers + 2-3 good books should suffice. Apart from that, focus on reading anything and everything to improve your VA RC skills and Puzzles and brain teasers to improve your overall aptitude.If you have specific things to ask, you can always message me. Hope this helps. All the best."
CAT,How do I prepare myself for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-prepare-myself-for-CAT,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation",100+,"The following article describes the way I prepared for CAT (2016). This strategy worked for me and hopefully it works for all you guys as well.WARNING!!! – This is a pretty lengthy but descriptive article so those who don’t have the time, maybe you can come read this later!I started preparing seriously from the month of March. So here it goes:March – May: PRACTISE, PRACTISE PRACTISE!!!I dedicated this period to work on the “Fundas” and getting conceptual clarity on various topics.Before I get onto what I did, I just want to say that if any of you out there want to sign up for an online or offline course where all the necessary Fundas are taught well – then please visit 2IIM’s official website. This is by far the best place to get all your basics right.Here is the link: http://www.2iim.com/The director of 2IIM, Rajesh Balasubramanian himself is an alumni from IIM-Bangalore and to put it in simple words – his style of teaching and more than anything his articles and blogs are AMAZINGG!!Coming back to the main content, my advice to those of you who are just starting your prep will be: focus on practicing as many questions as you can. This is not the time to take full length MOCK CATs.Quant: I had bought TIME material, so I just stuck onto those. Those books are very good and give enough practice for any serious aspirant. The TIME material consists of 3 types of exercises: Conceptual Review, Exercise-(a), and Exercise-(b). So, I solved each and every problem from the TIME books and I feel this is very important because this is when one becomes familiar with all the different types of Quant problems that are likely to come in the actual CAT.DI/LR: Again, to prepare for this section, it takes a lot of practice. So just practice all the problems that are there in the TIME material. When I started solving DI/LR problems, I somehow found that I was able to solve LR problems easier than DI. But the truth is, I feel DI problems are easier to score as once you figure out how to get the answer (which will take less time than in LR), you will invariably get it. Also, the main thing in DI is understanding the given data as quickly as possible and figuring out a way to get a solution with the given data. A similar thing holds good for LR problems as well.Another important thing is, DO NOT use the online calculator for every tiny bit of calculation when solving DIs. You can use it for some end-calculations where there is a complicated division or so involved.VA/RC: This section is something that many engineering aspirants tend to under-prepare. As far as the English section is concerned, it requires consistent practice and the fruits of your efforts can be seen only much later, unlike the other two sections. For RC, the only way to do well is to develop a good reading habit. So, even if you have never had a reading habit, it’s high time you start because RC is all about comprehension. The ability to look out for what is important even as you read will come only when you keep reading. Also, your reading speed will improve only with practice. So while reading RCs, the strategy is to make a mental 1-line summary of every passage, as you read. So once you start answering the questions, you know which passage to go and look at while referring the RC. I figured out these things from Rajesh Balasubraminan’s blog and articles.Here are some of his links:http://catscores.2iim.com/http://iimcat.2iim.comVA section is again only practice. This section has various types of questions like Para-Jumbling, Sentence Correction, Fill in the blanks question, etc. Again, practice literally every single problem there is in the TIME material. That is the only way the next couple of months of your CAT prep will go on smoothly.The essence of what I want to say is solve every single problem in the TIME material. To do that you have to frame a schedule. Back-work and figure out a schedule that you can stick on to so that you will be able to finish all the TIME materials before May. You can divide months into weeks and divide weeks into days and plan what you’ll be doing every day, so that it finally adds up till May. One important thing is to plan a realistic schedule. And by that what I mean is if there are 30 days in a month, don’t plan something for all the 30 days. Keep like a buffer of 5-6 days of nothing, so that if anything spills over from the other days, you can use your buffer days for finishing what you had scheduled.June-August: ACCURACYThis is a good time to start taking your full-length MOCK-CATS. I followed AIMCATs. The whole of Internet is filled with stories of how AIMCATs are much harder than actual CAT. But, personally I never felt so. AIMCATs are approximately of the same difficulty level as the actual CAT. So, take them seriously.Quant: I wanted to get even more practice for all the topics, so I spent about 2 months finishing the Arun Sharma book: LOD-I and LOD-II. I feel Arun Sharma’s Quant book is amazing and it will be useful if you get to practice from this book. So if you have the time, then go ahead and finish solving this book also.DI/LR ,VA/RC: If you are done solving the TIME material, then you should start solving sectional tests that any coaching centre offers. I followed TIME for this. Their sectional tests are good and plenty. I was never able to finish all the tests for any of the sections. But keep doing it till the D-Day.Accuracy is everything so it’s really important to know the right way to analyse your MOCKs. You can find more detailed explanations on Rajesh Balasubramanian’s blogs. But here’s a gist of what I followed:Re-Solve the entire paper.· Make a note of the type of mistakes that you make. I used to tabulate them in an Excel sheet (to make it interesting)For example:o Conceptual Mistakes – because you didn’t know how to do that problem ->Again make a note of the solution.o Silly Mistakes -> Make sure the number of silly mistakes keep reducing with each MOCKo Questions you shouldn’t have attempted -> some questions are too hard/tricky – you should be able to make that judgement before you attempt.o Questions you should have answered, but you didn’t.· There are some types of questions that repeatedly appear in your MOCKs and have also appeared in previous CAT papers.o Ex: Some English words – add them to your vocab list and keep revising them everydayo Some types of Quant problems like – lying milkman, mixtures, compound-to-simple interest ratios.Make a note of such things and revise them everyday.Also, DO NOT keep comparing your percentiles with other people or your immediate previous percentile. Your performance must be measure over a period of time and generally AIR ranks give a better measure of where you stand in the country.September-November: STRATEGY & CONCEPTSThis period is extremely crucial and can be very nerve-racking. This is the time when you’ll have to slowly start forming a strategy as to how you will be answering the questions (in which order and how much time). I followed the following strategy:VA/RC: I decided that I would answer all the RC questions first and then only do VA section. Since, invariably more number of questions were for RC section in my MOCKs. The CAT-2016 pattern was such that the exact number of questions in each section was not known. But I went with the strategy of spending 2/3rd of the time for RC (40mins) and 1/3rd for VA (20mins).DI/LR: Between DI and LR, I had decided that I would do DI first and then LR. In DI, I decided I would do the easiest DIs first. Then I would do the easiest LRs. After this, I should have solved approximately 2 DIs and 2 LRs. Then if I have time, I would go back to the DI section to the DIs that can be done but will take a little more time to do. If there is time even after this (which is very unlikely), I will do the remaining questions from the respective sections.Quant: In this section I decided to spend half the time to literally solve all the very easy problems in the section. There will be at least 10-12 very easy/easy level problems, which you can do and which you should do. Then, in the remaining half of the time, whichever questions I knew how to do, but would take a little time to solve, I did those problems. And during the first half, I would ‘Mark for Review’ the problems which I should do for the second half.Depending on the difficulty level, you should solve anywhere between 20(if section is hard)-30(if section is easy) questions per section to get 98+ or 99+ percentile.Day before CAT: BE POSITIVE!Quite honestly, there is not much preparation that you can do on this day. So just relax! Spend time with people who will encourage you and will make you feel good about yourself. And whatever you do make sure your morale is up and you stay positive. Also, make sure you keep a check on all the important stuff that you need for your exam the next day. Try to get a good sleep! ;)D-Day: TRUST YOUR EFFORTS AND BE EVEN MORE POSITIVE!DON’T go late to the exam centre! The last thing you need is feeling tensed about the small things. Remember to feel good about yourself and your efforts. The more you believe in your efforts, the greater are the chances that you will score well. Also, keep telling yourself that none of your efforts will ever go waste so just have faith in yourself and be positive!If you’ve reached the end of this article, well I got to say: Thanks for taking the time to read and hope this gives you direction for your CAT preparation. All the best for all the aspirants!With that said, I’d like to mention that I had got 96.72 percentile in CAT-2016. As far as I can remember, I attempted 29 questions in VARC, 15 in DILR (it was the hardest section) and 15 in Quant(I messed up my time management a little).My goal was to do PhD in one of the IIMs and get into teaching and management research. So I had applied for the doctoral programme at IIM - A,B, C. This programme is called FPM - Fellow Programme in Management. Will write an article on FPM and how to prepare for it very soon. Most of the entrance exam scores can be used to apply for this. I chose CAT as I wanted to keep my options open - in case I didn’t get FPM, I thought of pursuing MBA.I am currently pursuing FPM in IIMB in the area of Marketing.","A step-by-step guideGo online, google CAT Online Preparation.Click on the second link - one that says online.2iim.com.Sign up as free user, try out a few classesBe reasonably impressed and say “I am going to see what the reviews say about online coaching”Go online and google “CAT Online coaching review”.Check out this link What is your review of 2IIM Online CAT Preparation?Go to Online CAT Coaching and CAT Preparation: Crack CAT 2016 and start preparation.I run 2iim and we guys here believe that CAT preparation should be fun and not overwhelming.

About 2 lacs aspirants appear for CAT examinations. Understandably, competition is very steep.The CAT exam is generally conducted in November each year. You are entitled to appear for the CAT exam if you are a graduate or in the final year of a bachelor’s degree. The CAT exam is a computer-based exam, which consists of the following three sections:Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VRC)Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI & LR)Quantitative Ability (QA)Tips on Preparing for CAT examCAT aspirants should always commence early in preparing for the exams as an early start would suffuse them with an all out knowledge and strategy to go about the examination.English reading , comprehension & Maths reasoning , logical skills are to be primary focus areas in order to cross the hurdle of CAT exams and get admitted in your dream MBA institute.Reading extensively (be it any news paper, magazines, journals, novels) will give that extra edge to get over the reading and comprehension section in CAT examination. Repeated Maths practice will make you a pro, and you will pass with flying colours in the CATS maths section. There are never long equations in CAT, the only thing which works is the smart way of calculations which can be mastered by practicing the tricks available in books and internet.You must associate yourself with the people who have successfully cracked the CAT exams and imbibe confidence and take useful tips from them. CAT students should look at questions from previous years' CATs and understand its syllabus.A mandatory part of your CAT preparation would be to take online mock tests and sharpen your abilities, ideas and timing as far as taking on the examination is concerned. In this context you should asses the mock test results and work on your shortcomings before taking the final plunge.Managing one's time includes balancing speed with accuracy, handling the pressure and uncertainty and the apt decision making.learning to allocate time while answering to various sections of the CAT exam paper is very essential. It is so since you need to finish the paper on time with almost all the correct answers to score maximum.Negative marking is a part of CAT. Aspirants are advised to not take wild guesses in the Exam paper. Only if the student is able to eliminate 2-3 choices, then he should take a guess. Otherwise there is no point in wild guessing, as it may drop ones chances of making it right.You must unwind before the exams. Over stressing can have negative impact on your output during the examination. Be your natural self and confident. Keep calm and cool. You must be aware of your examination centre before hand, all the documents, stationeries you need to produce at the centre should be kept handy so that trifle mismanagement may not unnerve you.Doing well in the CAT exam is the first step to ensuring that you get the education to build a great future. It involves a lot of hard work and is one of the most difficult competitive exams. But with right kind of focus and determination you are sure to be successful in cracking CAT.I hope you had a good read. All the best for your exams.

I cleared CAT 2013 and got into IIM Kozhikode and was working alongside while I was preparing. I’ll help you understand how I did and you can use it to similarly design your preparation schedule. This is how I was managing my weekdays-1. 5:30 AM: Up from Bed2. 6:00- 8:00/8:30 : CAT preparations3. 9:30-6:30 : Office4. 6:30-9:30: Relax and do miscellaneous things5. 10:00-10:45: Revise learnings from the morning hoursWeekendsSaturday: Answer MocksSunday: Review Mocks thoroughlyI would highly recommend you to setup a schedule for yourself and stick to it. Each day will help you build on your preparations.As you can see, I had a packed schedule and which kept me away from those long classroom coaching sessions. As an alternate source for preparation, I joined Handa ka Funda Online CAT Coaching Classes - MBA 2016 which is an online platform with no time constraints. It made me stick to my schedule and help me prepare really well.Having sorted out your schedule and also being enrolled in the online coaching , you need to emphasize on practising questions intensively. Please stress on those areas where you feel you need to improve. That’s the key to achieving that extra percentile at the top.Protip: While CAT concepts do have short cuts, success does not. The key is always hard work and practice.Do well !Tips for Working Guys: CAT is difficult to be managed with job but it has to be done (leaving a job for cat is too risky considering the unpredictability of the exam). Assumptions for below : 1. Total of 10-11 hours outside home (office + travel to/fro office) 2. Sat & Sun Weekend off In case any of the assumptions are not valid in your case, try to accommodate the points as per your schedule. 1. Give equal importance to all the 3 sections. Do not live under the veil that you can cover one section with another. It is difficult to do. Considering the unpredictability of VA and high difficulty level of DILR, focus on all the sections. 2. Daily news-paper reading (Hindu/Economic Times). 3. Daily VA practise from old mocks/sectionals. (IMS - all, Time - leave RCs, Cl - leave RCs) 4. Daily DILR practise from old mocks/sectionals. (IMS, CL, Time - all) 5. Daily QA practise from old mocks/sectionals. (IMS, CL, Time - all) 6. On weekdays allocate 6 hrs for studying (2 hrs for each section as told above) & on weekends9 hrs for studying (3 hrs to each section) and 3 hrs for mock and 2 hrs for mock analysis 7. Should finish QA theory and formulas by July/Aug. 8. From Aug/Sep onwards only revision and mocks and sectionals. 9. Should give atleast 2 mocks each weekend and their analysis. Should give all centre based mocks from centre itself to be prepared for all exam scenarios. 10. Last month (assuming Nov) : 1 mock each day and its analysis 11. Take an off atleast 1 week before the exam and give mocks at exam time. 12. Sneak in time for your hobbies during the preparation. Happy Prepping !! Don't overstress.

CAT,CAT or GMAT which one is tougher?,https://www.quora.com//CAT-or-GMAT-which-one-is-tougher,"Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",56,"Do you have domestic plans or international plans?Do you carry actual work experience?Can you spare your time for T.I.M.E?How do I score 750+ on GMAT?Ans: GMAT is super easy. You can take the GMAT exam max 5 times in 1 year. You can take each exam after every 16 days as per GMAC's new policy. I know it does take $250 (~Rs.16000) for each exam you take. Just remember that this exam is gonna decide your career and a very high GMAT score will fetch you a guaranteed 30%-50% scholarship as an international student. Top B-schools can track your record of each attempt you made to pick up the best score you earned. I'd suggest not more than 3 scored attempts and the score remains volatile for 3 years. Try to get at least 3 years of work experience (actually speaking, you need 5 years of Work Ex to become a very strong contender) and since you've got a lot of time, why not prepare from Day 1 instead? This is how a normal guy would think right? However, to prepare and crack a super competitive exam like GMAT there is no need for a tuition class and you don't need to prepare heavily for 3-5 years for this exam.You just need to subscribe for an online course (gmat.magoosh.com or gmatprepnow.com)and try to solve 40-50 Questions everyday for a period of 75 days for Math and Verbal lessons with 109 secs on stopwatch for each Qsn. Try 50 Qsns x 100 Secs = 5000 secs everyday's mental pressure i.e. 90 mins of mental football everyday for the next 75 days w/o half-time.Analyze your score.Improvize on the weak areas. It will take a month's time to refresh your Math and Verbal skills via tutorials.Plus, you do not want to waste and wait for 1 year for the CAT exam.GMAT is accepted in most B-Schools in India (even IIM-A/B/C/.......but only for top 1%-2% candidates).If you are currently pursuing your Bachelors degree i.e. if you are in 2nd or 3rd or 4th year engg., you must take a look at ISB's YLP program. Talk to the AdComs i.e. Admissions Committee for the median cut-off for undergrads. A score of 700 on GMAT would do the trick in Stage2.IIM-A/B/C median GMAT score is 750+ (but the FPM doctoral program has 680+ ->  48Q and 39V minimum for FPM admission i.e. >87th %ile).If you are an Indian, you must have at least 4 years of work ex and 730+ on GMAT for IIM-Bangalore (check this coz the competition here is too stiff).Go for EPGP and save your 1 year (-: It is a 720 hrs intensive program as against 960 hrs of its flagship PGP program.If you are an offshore candidate and did your MS abroad (>= 18 months program), you can send your GMAT score of 710+ for IIM-Bangalore (as of 2015) for 2 years PGP program (very good for networking).XLRI's median GMAT score is 680-690 i.e. >85th %ile.No shortcuts to XAT for BM via GMAT.If you have 2+ years of Work Ex, wait for 1 more year and aim for Global MBA  orIf you have 4+ years of Work ex, wait for 1 more year and go for GMP.Be ready with your GMAT score by 15th December for XLRI.ISB Hyderabad GMAT median score is 700+ i.e. >89th %ile.It is a 700 hrs intensive 1 year PGP program.Again, minimum 2 years of Work ex would suffice for ISB.(people generally have 4-5 yrs of work ex here.....So, if you have just 2-3 yrs of work ex, you need to earn a very high score on GMAT for sure).For ISB, be ready with your GMAT score by 15th October for Round1 or 15th Jan for Round2.If you are from Mumbai:SP Jain (650+)SJMSOM - IIT Bombay (700+)NMIMS (600+)Welinkar (600+).....All accept GMAT and will fetch you â‚¹.100k/month package for sure (-:but IIM Bangalore's package would be â‚¹.200k/month. So, rethink again!!!The beauty of GMAT is that you can mentally prepare yourself with 1 month's preparation and crack the exam with 700+ score. I'm talking about 150,000+  out of 1.29 million people cracking the 700+ score (equivalent to 89th percentile score) in the past 5 years:http://magoosh.com/gmat/2014/wha...Now, imagine if you want to crack the score of 700+ and hope for an admit to top 10 universities in USA, you'll have to go beyond 710-720 score to get a Wharton/MIT/Stanford/Yale call .....depends upon your MBA aspirations. Yes if you have a vast amount of Work ex, you can score low on GMAT i.e. 680-720.Remember, I said that it is much easier to study with your own pace and crack the GMAT in 2 months time and get a 750 score....every student competes with nearly 5000 applications in a university (Top15 B-schools) for getting an admission according to the specialization.....again depends.CAT needs 5-6 months of preparation (but you have to wait for 1 whole year for this exam) and if you aspire to have an IIM tag on your belt just to show the world that you are the Man, you can choose to give your CAT, get mentally set for the 99th percentile score and in the meantime you can easily give GMAT a try for 1 or 2 attempts :)Likewise, GMAT is awesome. Verbal has SC-CR-RC with 13-14/14-15/19-22 marks respectively. So, anyone who scores 13-14-19 on Verbal SC-CR-RC, will be on a high scorer bracket. Quant goes with 40% DS and 60% PS i.e. 15 and 22 Qsns approx. respectively. Math has no Graphs/Calendar/patterns logic/hard Functions....no Calculus and DI(except for 12 IR Qsns). It's purely logical.GMAT can be cracked with your own pace. CAT needs a lot of time. A lot of patience!GMAT Verbal will kill you for sure. But it gets more interesting when you try to solve a couple of hundred Qsns from each section :)There are 8 x 3 topics for Quant, SC and CR.See the pic below:â€‹So, there are around 30 topics in total that you need to master in 100 days right?For Quant, OG content + Magoosh + Manhattan is enough.If you are really really weak on the Verbal part, start with the foundations -Nautical Miles by IMSorWord Power Made Easy by Norman&LewisorManhattan MGMAT Foundations of Verbal book.You have tons of Apps in the App Store for pocket prep.Try these:Official GMAT app by gWhiz (in-built Timer + Reset button),Prep4 GMAT app by MIT guys (a very comprehensive app),Veritas Question Bank app (has 250 quiz qsns...50 for each),Complete GMAT Video Course app by Veritas prep,GMAT ToolKit 2 app for flash cards,Magoosh GMAT Math app, GMAT idioms app for flash cards,Pocket GMAT app by Manhattan for flashcards(For more flashcards, go to beatthegmat.com website),Pranayama app (for 5 mins mind yoga) andTimer+ app (stopwatch).The GMAT online forum community helps you a lot. Only 2 main active GMAT best forums in the market with over 10 years of expertise are gmatclub.com and beatthegmat.comDon't even think to go beyond that (-:So, log in and skim through the entire website rightaway.Become a silent observer of top main moderators (e.g. Bunuel and bb on gmatclub.com) and top members and followers on both the forums (-:Try to solve at least 10 mocks that are available for free for the 1st attempt (from Manhattan MGMAT, Veritas Prep, The Economist, Kaplan, 800score, Platinum GMAT, http://litesee.com/gmat.htm for verbal, Princeton Review, gmatclub.com and the actual GMATPrep s/w that includes 4 actual simulation tests of the GMAT exam ) and try to supplement it with an online course such as magoosh.com or gmatprepnow.com (hardly takes $99 for Magoosh and $0 for gmatprepnow).Buy the actual Quant Review and Verbal Review from GMAC.(buy it from amazon.in ;) save â‚¹300)Wiley, the publisher, provides you an online access to solve the same Qsns which allows you to simulate real GMAT exam mode online (-:Buy Question Pack1 from the mba.com (takes $30).Now, see the pic below:Total = around 3000 Qsns here.If you follow my chart shown below, you'll get your dream score for sure.Byheart this chart and solve these Qsns 2-3 times.Maintain your Error Log:GMAT Error Logs - Free Tools for your GMAT StudySo, say if you want to crack GMAT in 100 days, take out the entire column and divide it by 100 i.e. try to solve 6 DS 9 PS 5 SC 4 CR 1 RC passage per day. Try to go step by step. 1st complete Magoosh in 20-25 days and then touch the OG content and then touch your laptop with GMATPrep QsnPack1 practice. At this modest rate, you can easily cope up with 34-35 Qsns/day. Take rest on Sundays. This is really important. Don't budge. Complete the entire practice set and you'll feel confident enough to crack the mocks after 50 days for sure. Why 50 days? Remember, 3000+ Qsns are actually hidden in the mocks as well. So, double or triple your speed as per your capacity to digest that kind of data in your head. Keep that hunger and solve 20 mocks at least :)Don't forget to solve Manhattan MGMAT Qsns(I've not mentioned here in my chart) for SC and it really helps to crack the SC section if you could download ""Thursdays with Ron"" which is entirely for free (-:It has 50+ videos till date with more than 80+ hrs of online coaching content and get a high speed internet connection for downloading this 15 GB of awesome Verbal content or stream it as you wish:http://www.manhattanprep.com/gma... Do check this for consolidated files:http://gmatclub.com/forum/update...You don't need to go for an actual mentor coaching because the online part covers everything and the forums will help you solve your doubts quickly (-:These are 2 eBooks with 200 pgs of awesome content that you must read: SC Tips eBook from Prep4GMAT by MIT guys (-:SC eBook from Magoosh's blog for idioms (-:Even if you are not satisfied with your official CR content and are really hungry for more, go for Powerscore CR bible, Powerscore RC and the Official LSAT SuperPrep......You'll have to dedicate another 100 days to cover this entire topic (2000+ Qsns) if you are weak in CR or RC. Actually speaking, you need to really do the OG content and feel each CR Qsn thoroughly. For RC, you'll have to improve your english skills if you are a non-native. This means that you'll need to read NYT/The Economist/ The Hindu or play with fiction novels. You do realize that these great authors and highly paid writers have strong vocab skills embedded with years of practice and perfection....I am Marathi. I sucked at verbal with 30-34 initially. And I have read 570+ novels and 10,000s of articles. So, daily I journalize my stuff. Keep this habit and you'll understand how I could crack GMAT in 72 days. It is not by magic. You need to hone your logical reasoning skills.For RC- Don't be bleakly emotional with the cognitive content. If you keep on doing the same RC passages or skim it twice or thrice then you are certainly weak on RC. Familiarity breeds contempt!! But stay focussed for at least 100 days and you can crack your Verbal with a perfect 43/44/45 (-: You know, you don't need a TOEFL score if you have a strong Verbal score on GMAT (-: But give it anyway coz you need to convince your Visa interviewer to make him/her happy.For those who are struggling with Verbal and want to catapult your score, invest in e-GMAT subscription for $199. I never tried it but my friends told me it is cool for a non native.Would suggest T.I.M.E for CAT for sure ....no doubt about that!Full-time faculty members @T.I.M.E are really naive to not to give GMAT and  guess what, GMAT Math is 3 times easier than what I experienced from CAT but GMAT Verbal is 3 times difficult.......nobody might have told you that right (-:Also, nobody might have whispered this to you:GMAT calculates past 3 years percentile scores i.e. close to 22 Lakh scores.CAT just calculates current year percentile scores i.e. close to 2 Lakh scores.http://www.mba.com/india/the-gma...(For example, Yale SOM last year's admission was for 710-720. Now, because so many took the GMAT and many scored beyond 720, the median cut-off for Yale is now 720+ as of 2015 which was 710+ as of 2014!!!)More than 1.29 million people took the GMAT exam in the past 5 years and more than 3.72 million score reports were sent.So, %ile scores are really hard to earn these days.A GMAT score of 750 used to be 99th %ile score in 2005,Now, 750 is considered as 98th %ile score in 2015.That's okay!! You don't need a 750 score. You just need to get beyond 720....Q50,V40 will easily fetch you a Top10 B-school call :)So, if you are intelligent enough to decide for yourself, you might say both exams are super tough.GMAT focusses mainly on Verbal and CAT focusses mainly on Math.For those who really don't understand:AWA (nothing but an argument's analysis = 30 mins)+ IR(hard mix of 12 Qsns i.e. 33-39 sub-Qsns from Quant+Verbal = 30 mins) + Quant (37 Qsns = 75 mins)+ Verbal(41 Qsns = 75 mins)= GMAT :)AWA can be done in 1 session :) Easiest section on GMATHow to get 6.0 AWA....my guide... byheart the template a million times.IR needs crazy reasoning skills.Quant is easy.Verbal can chew up your score into pieces...!!!The exam is for 3.5 hrs. So, visualize your cockpit (-:Keep 10 days reserved for taking mocks prior to your GMAT exam (-:If you are a novice beginner, I'd say 100 days to GMAT or 200 days to CAT.If you are an intermediate, I'd say 75 days to GMAT or 150 days to CAT.If you are an expert, I'd say 60 days to GMAT or 120 days to CAT.In conclusion, if you can crack GMAT with 760, with an extra effort on the Math, you can easily crack CAT with 99.99%ile.My Total Cost for GMAT : approx. Rs.36000 /- (buy books from amazon.in itself, it is actually cheaper than flipkart ;))1. GMAC's Official Guide with 900 Qsns for Rs. 11002. GMAC's Quant Review and Verbal Review books with 600 Qsns for Rs.15003. GMAC's Study collection for Rs.4600 (QsnPack1 with 500 Qsns and ExamPack1 with 4 genuine mocks = $72) from mba.com....You have to practice this on laptop/PC.4. gmat.magoosh.com with 900+ Qsns takes Rs. 6300 ($99 premium purchase) and includes 1 mock test.5. Manhattan MGMAT books for Rs. 3200 (only SC/CR/RC) with online access to 6 hard mocks. Also, buy Foundations of MGMAT Verbal and Advanced GMAT Quant = Rs.2000.6. GMAT exam fee is  $250 i.e. Rs.16,300.Plus, I borrowed the Powerscore CR Bible, Powerscore RC and Official LSAT Superprep from my mentor. So, I saved ~6000 bucks (-:Note : Schedule your exam date 2 months prior to your GMAT.Well yes, if you happen to stumble upon GRE, you can download ETS.org's free Powerprep s/w and you can check which exam is better by simulating both the GMATPrep s/w and PowerPrep test s/w......each has 2 mocks for free (-:Tip -> Judge both the exams after studying at least for 1 month prior to taking any simulation test.Both exams are accepted by MBA programs as well.Mostly for Masters/PhD, you take the GRE exam.Mostly for B-schools for MBA (or a relevant PhD), you take the GMAT exam.What is the GMAT equivalent GRE score?Check this:http://www.ets.org/s/gre/flash/b...GMAT Total score = -2080.75 + 6.38*GRE Verbal Reasoning score + 10.62*GRE Quantitative Reasoning scoreThe regression equations:GMAT Verbal score = -109.49 + 0.912*GRE Verbal Reasoning scoreGMAT Quantitative score = -158.42 + 1.243*GRE Quantitative Reasoning scoreSo, V164 minimum on GRE = V40 on GMATand Q168 minimum on GRE = Q50 on GMAT.So, a GRE score of 333 = GMAT score of 750+..'. GRE score of 327 = GMAT score of 700.Note: If you want to send your score for Top10 B-schools, try to get 330+ on GRE.Top B-schools won't tolerate your score after your 3 scored attempts on GMAT and if you've failed to get a good score on GMAT even after 3 scored attempts, I'd say switch to GRE if you are really in a hurry bcoz application deadlines are near and you've exhausted your 3 scored attempts on GMAT already (coz you know each scored attempt can be tracked by Top B-schools).ETS and GMAC are two separate entities now (-:The world is full of possibilities (-:Tips :Try ginger soup coz it raises your heartbeat (-:2 months leave  from  Work/Job (very important step to stay in focus for modus operandi)Now, try to take 10 days out and just auto-play all 300+ video lessons from Magoosh. Quant has some 180 video lessons and Verbal has some 125 video lessons. During these 10 days, don't practice any questions. Just enjoy the content. I completed the entire video lessons in 6 days and I re-played it again and again till I felt confident. Now solve 512 Quant questions and 425 Verbal questions separately. My entire time on Magoosh's website was 31 hrs. Why 31 hrs? bcoz I solved it thrice. All 900+ Qsns and diagnostic test as well. I just loved the Dashboard concept and Customize your practice filters.Solve OG 10th edition 1st and then solve the OG latest edition.People are really naive and don't know how to navigate a forum.

Put 1min 49 secs for all SC/CR/DS/PS Questions and 2-3 mins for the RC passages (90 secs for SC .....to save time for CR and RC during the real exam and 2-3 mins per IR Qsn).Observe the moderators here. Bunuel's posts on gmatclub.com for his ""signature collections"" especially for Quant practice serves best. You'll get another surprise attack of 1000+ Quant Qsns here :-)Do not throw any topic for option!! (as we used to do in our college days..!!!!)Have a self disciplined approach and do not corrupt your mind by watching tons of movies or TV series. Remember that GMAT is a matter of 100 days of study....thats it!!Hydrate your body well. Sleep for at least 8-9 hrs daily for the next 2 months followed by a short nap. REM sleep can do wonders (-:Finally, motivate yourself by comparing B-schools on mba .com's awesome School Finder Tool. Jot down the application deadlines of your dream B-schools and be prepared with LORs, SOPs and Essays for each B-school. Normally people apply in Round 1 and Round 2.For Round 1, be ready by end of August because at least 30%-40% seats are reserved for the 1st pool of applications. For Round 2, be ready with your score by end of December because your GMAT median score might not be upto mark and you really needed some more time. So, for getting an admission abroad, do your research 18 months well in advance :)Never ever apply in Round 3 because seats are already filled up. Hardly 5%-10% seats will be available and tons of people will fight for the same. So, better clock for Round 1 after few months :)I was shitting my pants after I scored 390 570 680 720 on the simulation mocks from GMATPrep s/w !!!...All you need to do is to be technically sound with the GMAT format....The way GMAT tests you and the way you need to test the GMAT (-:OG 10th Edition contains 441 Quant PS Qsns(136 are new), 274 DS Qsns (124 are new) and Verbal (SC-268 + CR-205 + RC-50+ Passages) 700+ Qsns.Get your Manhattan's MGMAT 10 study guides (or only verbal).I've never touched Nova or Kaplan or Barrons or etc. shit!!Every person will tell you a very different story on their roadmap to ace GMAT.....that is what you have to judge for yourself!!Some people will kiss Veritas prep, some will go for Economist Tutor (â‚¹.30k), some will go to youtube to crash their minds and some minds will crash and stick to Youtube playlists.....my sincere suggestion to you is: research more or stick to what I've said :)A bit more advice: Don't join T.I.M.E. or Byju's or Jamboree or Manhattan/Veritas classroom tutoring. These people will tell you what you already know. You just need cool resources and materials and proper time management which I've already discussed with you. Streamline your goals.So, you know for sure that with OG 10th edn, you can easily add 1000 Qsns to the Chart + 3000 Qsns from Mocks (1687 Qsns pool from GMATPrep s/w) + 1000s of extra Qsns from Manhattan + 3000 Qsns from my chart!!So, in all, you'll have to solve nearly 7500+ Qsns to get 750+ on GMAT and do not forget to solve it 2-3 times!!I should write a book on this thingy coz I've cracked it with a 750 score on the GMAT with 72 days of preparation. That is okay as compared to CAT with 140 days of preparation (again depends on your pace and patience).Just 10 weeks of hard work (unlike 20 weeks for CAT)!! I never tried Veritas prep's 6 mocks for $49 or gmatclub .com's 31 tests for $80.You don't need all of that to saturate your head.Even if you buy only 1 Manhattan MGMAT book (say SC) for Rs.1000, you can get an online access to all 6 hard mocks that will be valid for 1 year.Well some last tips:1. AWA score >= 5 and IR score >= 5 .....for Top10 B-schools.2. According to GMAC's new policy, you can cancel your GMAT score report if you think you have performed very badly during the test and you won't have to face the same Qsn on the day of your interview with the top B-school. This also means that if you are determined to crack GMAT in 1 year, you can give this exam and cancel the score 4 times and the B-schools won't notice anything. Well, trust me. You don't need that kind of attempts. At least, you can play the game for the 5th time ;)3. Also, since you know that GMAT is an adaptive test, you must be super alert and focussed to solve the 1st 10 Qsns on GMAT Quant section and the 1st 10 Qsns on GMAT Verbal section correctly during the test. If your initial Qsns are correct and you get 4-5 Qsns wrong at the end of Quant section and 4-5 Qsns wrong at the end of Verbal section, it really doesn't matter. You'll still score 700+ on GMAT.4. Carry a 100gms glucose biscuit and 1 fruit and 1 litre juice/water with you at the time of your GMAT exam and do not forget to wear a sweater because you'll be giving the exam @24Â° C for nearly 226 mins (You'll be given 8 mins break after 1 hour of AWA+IR and 8 mins break after Quant section). At the end of your exam, the GMAC portal will ask you whether you want to keep your score.... So, make this as a #1 thumb rule: Cancel your score report blindly if you don't get a 700+ score on the day of your GMAT exam!! Trust me, this will not only make your heart feel stronger but it will also make you feel more powerful the next time you hit the exam center.Some things I have not told you yet:5000 secs for everyday practice also means that you should give 10000 more secs to review the same (-:I did my entire practice on iPad coz it's sleek. Except for the Study Collection i.e. QsnPack 1 + ExamPack 1 which I did on my laptop.I personally made it sure that I completed at least 70 Qsns as per day's target.My max was 120. So, if you cannot keep up with your pace, you cannot rest on Sundays that is for sure. And I also confess the fact I sequestered myself in my room for 2 long months :-* It chafed me to be confined like this....but ultimately it paid off at the end!!Download ""GoodReader"" app. Now, download previous OG 12th Edition or 13th Edition in PDF format. Now, create an annotated copy and use Highlighter so that you can track your page by page progress and bookmark that page daily.Say, your MGMAT CAT's 6 mocks avg. score = 670 or 680. Well, actually you'll easily get 720-730 score on the real GMAT exam.If you score 710 on the GMATPrep s/w, your actual score on the GMAT will be +10 or -10 i.e. 700 or 720. This software is really precise.In total you'll have 20 mocks: 4 GMATPrep s/w + 6 MGMAT CATs + 10 Free mocks that I mentioned earlier. So, just focus on your Qs and Vs.e.g. IIMs want 49/50/51 on Quant and 43/44/45 on Verbal.For IIMs, you can keep your GMAT score for 2 years (in case you are busy with your international client or you decide to start working on your Startup idea before joining an IIM).And do not hesitate to give your GMAT for a 2nd or 3rd attempt.You know, some B-schools will easily give you a 100% scholarship.Read this:http://blogs.economictimes.india... ....This girl from India got $80000 scholarship and was cordially invited by Cox B-school in the USA.So, just imagine her total MBA financial outlay for subsistence would be very nominal for 2 years including Living/Rent/Utilities/Health insurance/etc....and this is the reason mostly Indian students opt for GMAT for abroad generous scholarships from B-schools.For Canada, Top 5 B-schools have GMAT score requirement of 650-700 only. So, if you score low on GMAT, don't destroy your hopes :) You can still immigrate to Canada in 3 short years :)OrIf your budget is really low i.e. ~$50k, I'd suggest go for MS in MIS only if you are a curious CS grad interested for a career in management in IT in USA or abroad elsewhere (you can work as a Software developer or in Operations or Analyst or etc. with a degree in MIS). MIS mainly requires a GMAT score and it becomes affordable to choose a cool university for the same coz you also know that most MIS programs are STEM related and will give you 2.5 years on OPT (unlike 12 months OPT for MBA). Here, you can save upto â‚¹.5 Lakhs on internship and literally complete your higher education under â‚¹.20 Lakhs abroad if you get a TA/RA i.e. Teaching Assistantship/Research Assistantship (So, shed a good conduct on your Professor and publish a research paper on your topic of specialization before you write your essays for admission).OrGo for a affordable Masters program in the USA (that requires a GMAT score) and after OPT if you find yourself lucky to win a H-1B cap/lottery, you can ask your Employer to fund your Part-time i.e. Weekend MBA program while you are still working on H-1B visa :) Your GMAT score will be still valid and you must use the score for a 2nd time for your MBA. So, tracing your timeline is really essential for this to happen. Alternate way: On OPT you can easily save upto $50k. So, all you need is another $50k. This $50k can be waived with scholarship via high GMAT score. A part-time MBA will take 3 years for completion. It is the same MBA degree (like a traditional/Full-time degree) but this time you won't have to worry about any loan/co-applicant or your Dad's help (-: and the best part is that you'll earn & learn at the same time.OrIf you are a stereotypical engineer or someone who is currently in the pre-final year of your graduation and you have zero Work Ex but if you have a stellar profile, go for Deferred admission: HBS 2+2/ Yale Silver Scholars program/ Stanford GSB deferred enrollment/ Chicago Booth Scholars program/ ISB Young Leaders Program/ IESE Young Talents program/etc. A high GMAT score would certainly increase your chances. What is this program about? It is the same MBA degree but you get to enroll in the 1st year directly after your undergraduate degree. For the next 2 years you'll have to work and in this way, you not only get B-school approved skillset but you also get a guarantee to comeback quickly after 2 years of Work Ex to complete your MBA (In short, if you ask me, you save your 2-3 years of your life since your competition will be with guys with minimum 4-5 years of work ex and you'll stand out to be the best candidate engaged with proper skills when you enter the 2nd year of the MBA program after 3 years).OrIf you've only completed your Bachelors degree, you can directly get into a fully funded PhD program (without the need for a Masters degree) from a reputed University anywhere in the world. A high score on GMAT would be required. So, here's another reason why you would like to spend 5+ years on a research to get an experience with a cool stipend. Why PhD? Coz you can self-petition for your EB2 visa (with tons of research papers) and you can also ask 3-4 employers to petition your H-1B visa in the USA. So, people who really know this directly apply for a doctoral program without giving it a 2nd thought (research more to get a mentor for your R&D in your specialization).For those looking for a Top B-school abroad and need a funding without a collateral/co-signer, just take a loan from Prodigy Finance: http://prodigyfinance.com to pay your entire MBA fees with a cool EMI over a period of 10 years. Hats off to this community initiated by INSEAD+LBS guys :)See, just motivate yourself with such articles and try to get 100% scholarship.Remember, 111-117 Qsns is what will decide your fate on GMAT :)The more you rely on unofficial content, the more you will become vulnerable to a bad score. Magoosh is just for brushing up your skills via tons of tutorials and practice Qsns. And finally, just trust Manhattan blindly bcoz I say so :)And because of the new GMAC's policy, what used to be 89th %ile score i.e. 700 on GMAT...would be 85th %ile in no time. So, quickly register to give the GMAT and keep a 100 days target :) and don't waste your precious time to join any stupid coaching classes....they will mess up your head even more!!!and let's say if at all you need Tuition coaching = 30k goneand let's say you are poor in verbal....e-gmat = 13k goneFor practice.....Magoosh = 6.5k goneFor learning....Manhattan MGMAT Study Guides = 10.5k goneFor official content.....Official Guides + Study Collection = 7k goneFor mocks....let's say you picked gmatclub.com's 33 mock Tests = 5k goneand let's assume you gave the GMAT exam thrice = 50k gone.'. Total = 125k gone.See, it becomes very expensive.Don't bother.Just keep an eye on your golden ticket to B-school via 100% scholarship, which can be upto $80k or about â‚¹.50 Lakhs. That's massive and generous!!Think of it (â‚¹.125k) as an investment in your future.Think of it as the last resort to spearhead your career.What you need is a high level fidelity to Math and English.So, be a lone wolf and try to be as fresh as a duke while studying ;-)Below is a GMAC research data report of past 10 years:Google: ""World Geographic Trend Report for GMAT Examinees""I've saved your efforts....check this:3.72 million Score reports Ã· 1.29 million students = avg 2.8 times!!.'. Each examinee attempts for a 2nd or 3rd time after taking the GMAT exam to earn a very high score to secure an admit to his/her dream B-school....as per new GMAC's policy, you can take the GMAT 5 times in 1 year.Can you do that for CAT in 1 year???Do you have the flexibility such as Round 1 or Round 2 application deadlines for top B-schools in India via CAT??Do you really want to get a -ve score after you hit a wrong option(CAT)??Can you build your accuracy for the non-MCQs with at least 75 marks(25 Qsns) on CAT with exactly 150 secs per Qsn in your hand??Can you beg for a cool scholarship (>=50%) with your CAT score?Plus, can you keep CAT score for at least 2-3 years??You have to actually wait for 1 whole year to take the CAT exam!!Then you start thinking 1st 6 months rest & then next 6 months CAT prep.Lol.....So, people who are lucky to read this post, dedicate 1st 6 months to crack GMAT. Next 6 months to CAT :)Remember, >95th %ile score (>720) for GMAT and >99th %ile score (>200) for CAT :)Here's a GMAT score chart. If you are aspiring for top B-schools, I'd say paste this chart above your head where you sleep and just dream about this triangle for the next 100 days (-: Your eyes should target V40 and Q50 (at the minimum).â€‹GMAT wiki search result:The GMAT does not measure business knowledge or skill, nor does it measure intelligence. According to the test owning company, the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving abilities, while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success.Coming to CAT:Didn't look at NCERT Std 6th to Std 12th books.Didn't do Arun Sharma a favor.Had no time at all for T.I.M.E. coaching (coz I was working) nor I wanted to get crammed with 40 people in a room which is supposed to be a room for a batch of 30 people.Have a really great shortcut to crack CAT....Career Launcher has Test series.Enroll with CAT TS+TG (Test Series + Test Gym) product:http://www.clexams.com/You have to shell off â‚¹.4000 for the same.Now, you must get hooked to CLexams.com portal for at least 100 days.It had cost me an entire day to figure out how the fuck should I approach to crack 8500 Qsns.So, made a really cool chart yet again:â€‹Tests pe Tests....Turns out Test Gym has 741 Tests in total.Test Gym Lite has:276 Tests for Quant.100 Tests for DI/LR.365 Tests for Verbal.31 full-length mocks and 45 sectional tests + 24 more from Test Gym Classic.Keep last 15 days for mocks. Again, go step by step. Complete 10-12 tests per day. Bookmark those hard ones.For pocket prep....download the MBA Exams Guide app from the Playstore.1 Test = 7 Qsns..'. 10-12 Tests = 70-84 Qsns per day's target.So, don't be gobsmacked coz it takes ~15 mins to solve a single Test.Again, don't forget to reset everything and solve it twice and thrice.Do the above and you'll get 99.99 %ile for sure.I made this decision coz I already gave the GMAT and I was strong with my Verbal and Math skills and most importantly, I was mentally set for solving those 8500 Qsns.And don't worry about getting a 99 %ile in your CL mocks.CL mocks are much tougher than the actual CAT exam.All Qsns are neatly refined to ace your CAT exam.So, even if you get 85-90 %ile in the CL mocks that would easily culminate into a 99th %ile score on the day of your CAT exam :-)So, be happy that you can actually ace the CAT in just 4000 bucks.Okay, I exaggerated a bit. You need â‚¹.2000 to buy Arun Sharma books.And download NCERT books too :)Do remember this: CAT will hit you with minimum 25 non-MCQs. Also, the concept of LR on CAT is pretty hard and you won't get enough time to solve 12 Qsns on LR. So practice real hard.(So, if you could get 15 Qsns correct in each section i.e. VA, DI/LR & QA you'd end up with a 90th %ile score on CAT. But if you can score 22-23 Qsns correctly in each section, you'd get a 99th %ile score....that's my analysis).Warning: Don't skip NCERT and Arun Sharma books if you have not given the GMAT exam 1st and you just wanna give the CAT exam 1st coz you'll have to dedicate 1st 30 days refreshing your skills for CAT Math itself. This is something not to be trifled with leniently. So, slap yourself and re-read my entire post again.Your head will be completely packed with 15000+ Qsns after GMAT and CAT.So, don't play all the cards at once (-:Remember, you still have a full marathon race before you :) From a monetary point of view, if you observe, only 12%-15% people giving CAT can afford to take the GMAT (or there are tons of other reasons for taking CAT.....job/support family/business....for execs/career in India/limited H-1B visas in USA/short OPT period of only 1 year for MBA guys in USA/cannot afford to sacrifice 6-7 years to repay $400k debt to Prodigy Finance if you have a H-1B visa/cannot afford to sacrifice 11-12 long years to repay $400k debt to Prodigy Finance in Indian currency/etc.).Advice on B-school debt by Warren Buffett:GMAT or CAT is not about a formidable challenge. It is about the ability to endure hardship against your sedentary ass!!And before you enter this mad quest just be sure to get at least 20+ genuine verified certifications (e.g. Business Informatics/Venture Finance/Statistics/Entrepreneurship/Innovation/Analytics/Accounting/Leadership/Digital Planning/Marketing/Finance/Strategy/Management/Economics/Operations/Critical Thinking/Creative Writing/Public Speaking/etc.) from Coursera :) to be well ahead of the competition to not to show empathy after a ""failed Startup"" situation in your essays. Trust me, it works even with Harvard ;-)And why I've emphasized on Top10 B-schools?It's an axiom of marketing: Reputation matters!!!And why did I give both the exams?It will take me 3000 more words to write exclusively and prove it to you ""Why not both the exams??"".So, anticipate your death after 25,000 days and just take out 250 days to crack GMAT and CAT.Chao*Best of Luck (-:+1Kudos=Thanks (-:","There is no competition between these two.How can you compare a Hayabusa and a Harley Davidson bike, both are made for different approaches.Similarly a Gmat exam and a Cat exam requires different set skills like-GMAT has an easier quant than Cat.Cat requires you to have a top notch academic background.A coaching institute of CAT in India will require you to study for various other exams conducted by private b-schools to which makes your study harder and this takes 12â€“15 months of studies.The % of people in India taking GMAT exam are times less than people appearing for Cat.The above point makes the Cat exam tougher as you need to top among the toppers for your entry in top Indian B-schools.But the story does not end here because a CAT exam may be tougher on paper but GMAT takes the toughness to another level.CAT has a nominal fees of 2,000 approx but if you are not a general category your exam will be done within 1,000/- Rupees only. On the other hand GMAT exam will tear you savings if you are not financially strong i.e it requires a sum of 16,000 rupees for one exam (if you want to give it 5 times in a year be ready to starve)The CAT exam is conducted by Indian Authorities only in and for India but a caste category person can beat you up with lower score in CAT if you belong to General category. This reservation do not exists in GMAT making it much of a true potential exam.CAT exam is tougher than a GMAT exam but do you know what you have to go through after getting a great score in both.For CAT you have to face an interview in that applied top B-school and if everything goes right then you are in.While GMAT topper has to start his 3â€“4 year journey until they apply to the top B-school. This requires you to have a job experience, good social background, extra curricular enthusiast, an enhanced leadership skill and at last top notch English communication. (This is why GMAT scores are kept valid for 5 years.This is because the foreign schools prefer practical skills than a theoretical knowledge which i thinks India lags somewhere.And last but not the least the expense in foreign colleges is much more than any other college in INDIA. So if you can work hard continuously for at least 5 years then go for it you will definitely get admitted with wavier and scholarships.","The Graduate Management Admission Test, popularly known as GMAT is probably the most important exam that can help you to get into the best MBA schools across the world. Beginning in 1953, GMAT is conducted by the Graduate Management Admission Council. The scores are accepted by over 2100 schools worldwide and for 5900 programs.Needless to say, this exam is one of the important steps that will help you to get into your chosen B-School. Though the GMAT exam is not the only factor for getting admission in the B-Schools, a good enough GMAT score makes the rest of the admission procedure incredibly easy.The GMAT exam is conducted at regular intervals all over the world and essentially contains four sections â€“ the analytical writing assessment (AWA), Integrated Reasoning, Quantitative and Verbal. The total duration of the test is three and a half hours and one score anything between 200 and 800.Like any other examination, the GMAT has its own challenges. It is one of the toughest MBA entrance tests and the very fact that it gives you access to the Top 10 colleges across the world shows its reach. The best part about GMAT is the fact that it is conducted multiple times in a year and hence a student can decide to take the test anytime depending on when they feel their preparation is up to the mark, unlike most Indian MBA entrance tests.Here are 5 tips on how to up your GMAT game.1. Fix the Test Date after you start preparingThe tendency for students irrespective of which part of the world they belong to is to keep the exam preparations for the last moment. But serious test takers will start preparing long in advance. For the lazy test taker, we suggest that you start preparing first and then later decide the date when you will take the test. If after three months of preparation you feel confident enough to take the test, sign up for the nearest test date. This way you will not wait for the last moment to start preparing. The larger aim of the test preparation comes into play here. Instead of preparing because you have to take the test, you prepare first and then decide to take the test.2. Study continuously, not sporadicallyLike most tests that assess your understanding of a variety of subject matters, you need to be in constant touch with the study material for GMAT as well. It does not help if you start studying mid way and then decide to resume after a weekâ€™s gap. This not only breaks the continuity of your preparation but also makes you forget valuable concepts and techniques. Thus being continuously in touch with your test preparation is needed. A one or two day break is acceptable, but anything longer would only bring down your level of preparation.3. Take a GMAT prep test to see where you standThe GMAT website offers two free prep tests that all test takers can avail. The best way to assess where you stand before you start preparing is to take one of these tests and see the scores and compare them against what you aim to achieve. They give a fair understanding of your current aptitude in GMAT and which ones are your problem areas. The only hazard with these free prep tests is that they are not adapted to empirical, standardized test results and can possibly give you a different understanding of your position. You can also always take the tests available on Princeton, Kaplan, Manhattan etc. and then use a GMAT Score Estimator/Calculator to find your real GMAT equivalent. Once you have started preparing, take as many prep tests as you can because only then can you gauge your own progress. Use your first score as the lowest limit and set a target score. If you prepare right, all the tests that you take must only point towards you reaching the target score.4. Discover your weakness and work on itEvery test taker has their weakness. Some are strong in quant but finds the verbal section problematic. On the other hand, someone may be very strong in verbal but quant is where they require some serious practice. Most people go for coaching classes but since most of these classes focus on both on Quant and Verbal, a person who is strong in one of these benefits from only half the material provided. It is, therefore, preferable to go for one-on-one coaching or study through an online course. It not only helps you to get individual and undivided attention but also allows you to choose what exactly you want to study depending on your need.5. Decide your own time milestonesThe nightmare of every test taker is not being able to finish a test. As children, all of us have had those dreams of time running out and our exam papers being blank. With a time-sensitive test like GMAT, it is quite possible that you might run out of time causing you to take random guesses that would do you more bad than good. The cleverest thing to do here is to see how much time each question will take and then set milestones that you need to achieve. For example, in the quant section, you must reach the seventh question with 60 minutes remaining and the fifteenth question with 45 minutes remaining on the clock. This way if you see you are falling behind early enough, you can speed up and finish the section smoothly.The key to getting a good GMAT score is knowing the right techniques and having the right amount of practice along with good time management skills. This test truly prepares you for the challenges of management career!All the best!Some useful resources:GMAT Prep: Critical Reasoning DecodedB-School Admission: Written Ability Test (WAT) and Personal Interview (PI)","GMAT & CAT have the same syllabus, both deal with Mathematics and English. Both tests complement each other. Preparing for GMAT helps CAT aspirants in verbal, and CAT preparation helps GMAT aspirants in Quantitative Section. Most of the sections in both the tests are common.MBA admission is a steep road. It's important to keep all doors open. It's good to be confident, but there is a thin line difference between confidence and over-confidence. CAT success rate (% of students getting admission in good colleges) is meager. GMAT, on the other hand, opens doors for almost all the global and Indian business schools.One more misconception about GMAT is that it's only for rich. A Business school is not ""Global"" if it does not keep ""Currency Disparity"" in their mind. That's why they offer scholarships to aspirants from lower-valued currency countries. Almost all the Indian students end up getting scholarships to study abroad.Note for Graduation Final Year Students:Business schools accepting GMAT scores need at least 2+ Years work experience. But then also it makes more sense to give GMAT with CAT. The first reason is GMAT score is valid for five years.Secondly, It's much better to have a GMAT score before selecting business schools. It gives time to aspirants to work on their needed profile.Thirdly, Taking out study time is much easier in student life compared to that in job times. Most of the working applicants find it very difficult to take time out for studies.Lastly, CAT success rate is meager compared to GMAT. Till your overall %ile is touching 99, you are not a serious candidate for IIM-A, B & C. And if your %ile is lower than 98%, you have to go for tier-2 B-schools only.GMAT & CAT Section-wise Analysis:Verbal Section  Sentence Correction: Both exams require candidates to spot grammatical errors. There is one manageable difference. GMAT SC is based on American English while CAT SC is based on British English.   Reading Comprehension: The passages in the CAT and GMAT are almost equally cryptic. RC in GMAT is more difficult than that in CAT.  Critical Reasoning: GMAT CR is tougher than CAT CR. If you are prepared for GMAT CR, then CAT CR is a cakewalk.Quantitative SectionCAT preparation will make GMAT Quant a kid's play. The good news is that many CAT topics such as logarithms, trigonometry, calendars, clocks, shares, etc are not tested in GMAT.Analytical writing assessmentGMAT tests your clarity of thinking in this section. It looks for content, the organization of thought process, language skills and writing mechanisms in evaluating the essays. The good news is that the AWA is not a tough section to ace.Visit www.EduShastra.com for more details."
CAT,What are the recommended books/materials for the CAT exam preparation?,https://www.quora.com//What-are-the-recommended-books-materials-for-the-CAT-exam-preparation,"NMAT Preparation, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Book Recommendations",100+,"One of the things that I have seen a lot of CAT aspirants worry about is the books related to CAT preparation. Probably it is natural to get worried about important things in life and CAT preparation is definitely one of the important steps in anyone’s career. Having said that, the choice of books is probably not an important one.There are plenty of great books that are available in the market that you can use and there is very little that separates them. First of all, if you are looking at understanding and application I would much rather recommend that you go ahead with an online coaching course for CAT. It would offer you a lot more than what any book can with the help of videos and live classes for doubt clarification.Having said that, it is also necessary to have some material or the other so that you can practice and eventually improve yourself to solve CAT level questions easily.To be honest, I would recommend that you try out the study material from IMS / TIME / Career Launcher as your first resource. This material is very well designed and keeps the needs of students as the first priority. The slight problem that exists with TIME material, in my opinion, is that sometimes it tends to be a little bit harder than required.You can easily skip out on that particular part of the chapter or those set of problems. However, you should have the knack of knowing what is relevant from a CAT perspective. Once you go through enough number of previous year CAT questions – you will develop that knack. In case you get a doubt regarding the same, you can obviously ask around in some forum. A basic thumb rule could be – can this question be solved from the concepts that you learn in class 10th? If yes – then it is probably relevant for CAT, otherwise, it is not.If it is a Logical Reasoning or Data Interpretation question that is really hard and you look at the solution and it gives you feeling empty headed – there is a very low chance of it getting asked in CAT. Even if it gets asked in CAT, there is a very low chance of most CAT aspirants, including you, solving it during the exam pressure. It is best to learn what to skip during your CAT preparation phase so that you can do it in the main exam as well.Books to avoid for CAT PreparationAs far as books are concerned, let me start with a few books that I do not think are very useful from a CAT preparation perspective.Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis – A brilliant book for building your Vocabulary. This book is probably the best possible way to develop a good vocabulary. The problem, however, with this book is that it is voluminous and bulky. Rarely have I come across a CAT aspirant who has been able to stick to this book for over a month. They start it with full gusto but give up on it in the middle. If building vocabulary is your focus, using some mobile apps is a good idea. The best possible “realistic” way to build a good vocabulary is to read books. Here is a list of recommended books for CAT aspirants.How to Read Better and Faster by Norman Lewis – Once again, a really good book. It is more of a workbook and has a bunch of exercises that can help you improve your reading speed. But perhaps – that is not something that you need. If you have a good reading speed, it helps. But probably it should not be your priority. The length of CAT passages has ranged from 400 words to 1000 words in the past decade. You can also say that it is anywhere from 150-250 words per question.Questions in CAT have rarely been so simple that if you speed-read the passage, you will be able to answer them. You might not need a deep level understanding of the passage but a superficial glance is not going to help you either. You might improve a little bit if you go through the exercises mentioned in the book but I would still recommend that you improve your reading habits rather than improving your reading speed.NCERT Books – I have been guilty of recommending the same to a few students who struggle with the basics of a particular topic. Over time I have realised why this recommendation does not work. The reason is not that these books focus on the wrong concepts. The reason is that they are not required. If you as a student are unable to understand a particular concept, it is not because of the book you are using but it is because you are not able to understand what is given in the book. Probably you need someone to explain it to you. You need someone who can clarify your doubts. The book is not at fault here – you are! I am sorry if this sounds rude. You should stick to your CAT books and study material.High School English Grammar and Composition by Wren and Martin – It is a great book but as the name suggests, you should have read it in high school. The importance of Grammar, sadly, has reduced over the years in CAT. Even earlier, CAT did not mean to test if you knew the definition of a gerund or how it is different from an infinitive. The objective always was to check if you were able to identify the correct sentence or not. Having said that, if you have a good command of English grammar – it will help you in the later stages of Group Discussion and Personal Interview. Most good Business Schools have a ‘Written Ability Test’ to assess your communication skills. Bad grammar at that stage can be a real problem. Once again, reading books (not by Chetan Bhagat) is probably a good way to improve in that area. It would be great if you start blogging. If you write a blog post a week, you would find a remarkable improvement in your grammar in a short time. Learning the rules from Wren and Martin will help you become a good English teacher but I guess that is not what you are aiming for.Some of the books that I think can help you with CAT Preparation are given below. Let me add, you should use these provided you cannot arrange for IMS / TIME / Career Launcher material from somewhere.Books by TMH – Arun SharmaHow to prepare for Quantitative Aptitude for the CAT by Arun Sharma – It is probably the most popular book for Quantitative Aptitude for CAT. It covers all the necessary topics in great detail and has enough number of solved examples as well. The main problem with the book is LOD-3. For those of you who don’t know, this book has exercises divided into three levels. The last level is called ‘Level of Difficulty – 3’ and frankly speaking it is quite useless for most CAT aspirants. The questions in these exercises are a lot harder than what you can expect in CAT. The problem that this creates is that CAT aspirants like to finish a chapter (and they should) before moving on to the next topic. Invariably, they get stuck in a few questions in LOD-3 and give up. If not, they end up wasting a lot of time on stuff that they do not need to know or learn. The benefit of using this popular book is that you can google almost all of the questions and you would find a discussion on the same online. Someone or the other would have discussed it before. There are three more books by TMH / Arun Sharma that you can consider:How to prepare for Data Interpretation for the CAT.How to prepare for Logical Reasoning for the CAT.How to prepare for Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension for the CAT.The set of all four books should cost you around 2500 Rs. I would not recommend that you go in for that. The only book that you should get from this set is the Quant book.Books by Pearson – Nishit SinhaPearson Guide to Quantitative Aptitude for CAT by Nishit Sinha – In my opinion, it is a much better book than the TMH book for the simple reason that it has more problems that are at par with the CAT difficulty level. It also has a lot of extra harder problems but you can and you should skip those. The problem with this book is that even after revisions, it does have some typos and errors. Be that as it may, it is my preferred book recommendation in this category. However, if you decide to go ahead with Nishit Sinha, I would much rather recommend these two books:Pearson Guide to Quantitative Aptitude and Data Interpretation for CAT by Nishit Sinha.Pearson Guide to Verbal Ability and Logical Reasoning for CAT by Nishit Sinha.These two books as a combo would cost you around 1500 Rs. It would be money well spent. While for Quant, it can be debated which is the better book between TMH / Pearson, for LR / DI / RC – Pearson book wins hands down. I especially love the way RC is dealt with in the Pearson books. To be honest, I would have recommended that you go in for The Pearson Complete Guide to CAT that costs around 800 Rs. but the number of printing mistakes/ errors is a bit too high in that one.Books by Arihant PublicationsVerbal Ability and Reading Comprehension by Ajay Singh – It is a pretty good book for Reading Comprehension. It has loads of passages for you to go through. I am often surprised by the lack of popularity of this one. It can be picked up if you are looking at a book specifically for VA and RC.Quantum CAT by Sarvesh Verma – If you already have some coaching institute’s material and are looking for something extra to practice in Quant (I do not agree with this idea but if you are), then probably this is the book that you need to pick up. It covers a large variety of questions and the difficulty level is also maintained. This book does not have the unnecessarily hard questions like most of the other books. Both of these above books are around 700 Rs.Which book(s) to buy for CAT Preparation?Now that I am done with the dispensing of ‘Gyaan’ regarding the books, if you are still confused about which book to buy – let me try and simplify it for you. If you have study material from a coaching institute like IMS / TIME / CL, you should try to finish it from start to end. You should not even look at any other books.If you have study material from a relatively smaller coaching institute like MBA Guru / Total Gadha / Byjus – I have no idea about how good or bad they are. Talk to your faculty – they will give you an unbiased opinion about it. If you want a book just for Quantitative Aptitude – go for Arun Sharma or Quantum CAT. Pick Arun Sharma if are comfortable searching on forums and looking up answers. That will help you learn some more stuff as well.Pick Quantum CAT if you just want to sit with the book and solve. If you want a book just for Verbal Ability – go to the VA / RC book by Arihant (Ajay Singh). If you want a book just for LR / DI / RC – there isn’t something that I can recommend. I don’t think you need a book just for that. Use previous year papers, and previous year mocks, etc. If you want books for everything – go for the two books by Pearson.I hope that all the information given about CAT preparation will help you as you needed. More information on the CAT preparation can be accessed from Getentrance.","First of all i am sharing very useful infographics then i will share best books which helps you to crack CAT Exam in First Attempt.CAT (Common Admission Test) is the entrance exam that is to be given by the aspirants who want to go for MBA (Master of Business Administration) or PGDM (Post Graduate Diploma in Management) from a top reputed college or institute.It is one of the toughest examinations and the competition is also very high due to the high number of students aspiring to get enrolled in reputed business schools to achieve their goals.CAT is an online or computer-based test and consists of three sections namely Quantitative Ability (QA), Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VRC), and Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DI & LR).While preparing for the examination, going for the option of coaching classes is much recommended as they help in understanding the examination and the syllabus with their expertise.

You can refer to any of these. I referred the latter one as suggested by one of my friends. However, I think the former is more popular with the students. Both the books are good. But don’t buy both. No need to unnecessary collect a lot of books & material. If you have limited time, solving one book is enough. Go for the second book only when you have finished the entire syllabus.Quantitative Aptitude:::Most problems in CAT/GMAT are actually meant to test your ability to look at a complex scenario and find simple solutions to it. You are wannabe managers, right ? A manager is not somebody who is a mathematical genius, but somebody who is proficient at efficient utilization of resources. In most problems, a bulk of calculation can be avoided by using logical arguments. This is the best way to speed up calculations – avoid the need for calculations. Before rushing on to make a calculation – stop to see if there are logical explanations that can resolve things to a great degree ? You will be surprised, that in most cases, this actually turns out to be so. The questions for these examinations are carefully crafted not to test whether you can find a cube-root, but to find out whether you can find the inherent patterns in the problem and reveal the underlying simplicity. Refer to these books for practise-How to Prepare for Quantitative Aptitude for CAT by Arun SharmaQuantum CAT by Sarvesh VermaPearson Guide for Quantitative AptitudeData Interpretation & Logical Reasoning :::Don’t get overawed by the sheer size of the table in the CAT paper. They are just a tool to frighten you. Like in comprehension, read the question before scanning the data. This will help you avoid fighting with and filtering useless data. Instead of doing exact calculation try approximation, while solving this section. All your hard work during Maths preparation will help you in approximation. If you have good grasp of the concept you can develop your own short cuts and you would never need to memorise them. Try to avoid using pen and paper while solving this section. Once the examiner forces you to use pen and paper then he succeeds in trapping you in the maze of endless calculation which is known as mathematics. Consider the following books for practise -Logical Reasoning for the CAT by Nishit K. SinhaHow to Prepare for Logical Reasoning for the CAT by Arun SharmaHow to Prepare for Data Interpretation for the Cat by Arun SharmaVerbal Ability and Reading comprehension :::Read the editorial sections of popular newspapers like the Hindu.

CAT,"Which is better for CAT coaching MBAguru, TIME or Alchemist?",https://www.quora.com//Which-is-better-for-CAT-coaching-MBAguru-TIME-or-Alchemist,"T.I.M.E Chandigarh (Triumphant institute of Managment Education), MBAGuru, CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching",56,"This is about MBA Guru and my experience with http://it.MyMy tryst with MBAG started when,during the course of my BTech , i realized,i simply didn’t have a knack for coding.Casually,i approached this thought and went and enrolled in the weekend batch in the kohat centre(1705ppc).And now i can confidently boast of this decision .CAT preperation doesn’t have a very clear trajectory or outlined syllabus except for the broad categorization,but this gives it all the more reason to be streamlined and be presented in the right way.Being divided into three main parts broadly:-DA/LR,VA,QUANT,MBAG has an appropriate environment to ensure coverage of all three.The 2 main points to look out for in an institute ,mainly are the faculty and modus operandi.Facculty at MBAG is amazing,specifically:-1.JASBIR SIR(DA/LR)-DA is mainly about identifying,approximation and interpreting the figures and thus leading to an answer.Sir navigates quite well through the course of laying the concept to bringing us to a stage,where we are well equipped to solve.2.ASHISH SIR(QUANT)-well versed and thorough with concepts,Sir brilliantly help us through our weak areas and also give us great tips to work on strengthening capabilities required here.3.TINA MAM(VA,COMMUNICATION/FAVOURITE PART 1)-Now coming to my favourite subject and one of my two favourite teachers,English seems to be quite my forte and Tina ma’am leaves no stone unturned in unravelling new concepts and meanings,each day, about this language, and that too in a very beautiful and concise manner,never deviating from the real purpose of helping us get a grip on that topic. No class can be predictable with her.She enthuses a vigour for this subject and after attending her class, one gets to know what were the shortcoming during a particular topic being solved earlier.4.VIKRAM SIR(GD/PI/FAVOURITE PART 2)-.An amazing teacher,Vikram Sir’s is the best guidance one can get for not only GDs and PI but CAT preperation in general.Ever felt the need of that one particular person who could give you personalized support and helped you create something that could make you stand apart from the rest of the crowd,Vikram Sir does this and a lot more.His words are golden and suggestions are more valuable and helpful,he will help you get on track an identify areas to work on and areas where you can excel and outshine.Now coming to the modus operandi:-The syllabus is covered with the help of class sheets,home sheets and concept booklets given alongwith every class.Class Sheets are to be solved side by side and home sheets are to be submitted in the very next class,which is what drives one to complete the topic,give a test based on it and assess himself or herself based on how he performed.This is entered in a card and that card can be helpful at the end to point out our strong and weak areas.NEHA AND RAJESHWARI MAM are the people who listen to our pains at length and help us cover our missed classes according to our schedules.All in all,i have come out of the dissident phase and have some faith that the support will be fruitful to my career.Arsheen KaurMBAGuruKohat Centre(1705)","This is the most honest answer you would come across. I’ve been a student at MBAguru for the past 7 months and my experience has been abysmal till now.Following are the concrete points that you should know before joining any center of MBAguru, as the story remains more or less the same:They do not have systematic classes. Many times I’ve been informed after arriving at the center that the class has been cancelled, after travelling for 1 hour. They give out cancellation information on informal platform i.e. Whatsapp class group which means that if you’re attending a backup or use your login through the app, which is the primary platform to stay informed about classes, you won’t ever know if the class will be held or not.Except very few teachers, others are mediocre and have no interest in checking if you have done your homework.There are no or very few doubt clearing sessions because the classes of batches are back to back without giving any window for such sessions.Though they promise to have stringent policy regarding homeworks, there’s hardly anyone to verify that you have actually done it. Put on any random marks on your score card and it’ll work perfectly fine. So, it’s not worth it.MBAguru sells itself through propagating their ad-prep system. Though, they have pseudo adaptive preparation system. I had Maths as my weakness and hardly had 3–4 classes for maths weakness throughout the season i.e. if you studied maths till 10th and think this is going to help you out, take my words it won’t.They ask their students to put on good reviews on knowledge sharing platforms such as quora, and even send sample ‘good’ reviews.You’ll waste more time in commuting and preparing for a class instead of actually attending it. On a normal day, my class starts 30 minutes later the time mentioned because the prior arrangements aren’t made.They have three hour class designed to do 4 work sheets, which never gets completed because the class starts late. Just after 4–5 classes there would be a backlog that would be a substantial problem for your preparation.There are similar or some different issues in any other offline coaching for CAT, be it TIME, CL or Alchemist. They play with the fact that students are most serious about their careers, and so are their parents. And thus, they rip off a huge amount from your pocket, guaranteeing a bright future to you. My coaching fee was around 40k and then you include all other cost of commuting, the time you wasted waiting for the class to began, and other stuff.I realised all this at the cost of wasting a lot of time and money, and would never want anyone else to experience the same problem. You would waste all your energy in thinking about the classes and the problems instead of actually studying for CAT. And this comes from a student who has been really hardworking and attentive throughout the time. A student who is not serious about this won’t even bother to convey the truth to future aspirants.My last piece of advice to all CAT 2018 aspirants is to join a good online coaching for preparation, as it is a growing industry and need to prove their mettle they are putting a lot of efforts in creating value for aspirants.","I cannot speak for other coaching institutes at length because I have not attended their classes. Therefore, what I will speak about is how good an institute MBAguru is, and whether it is worth your time and money.I was a student of zoology. I have done my bachelor's from Hansraj College, and my Masters from Department of Zoology. That's 5 years of background of zoology with almost zero handling of subjects one needs to ace for the CAT and the like. Needless to say, I knew I needed special help in Maths, or anything that had calculations.What made me decide to go for MBA guru was their promise of adaptive preparation (i will shortly get back to what adaptive preparation is). And these guys are living upto their promise. Right from the counselling session, i could sense their personalised approach towards students. Which brings me back to the concept of adaptive preparation. The first class they conduct is a SWOT(Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) session. After the SWOT assessment, depending on the scores, you will be allotted special classes called module sessions to work on the absolute basics of the topics you are weakest at. Does this mean other institutes do not concentrate on weaknesses? Of course they do as well. But what sets MBA guru apart from them is1. Sheer number of these module classes and doubt sessions. They see to it that you do improve. The batch size is also smaller (25–30 students per classroom) and it ensures a more direct interaction with the teachers. Many might argue that lesser number of students will reduce competition within the class, but ask yourselves : would you prefer to be in a competitive environment over strengthening your basics and concepts and minimizing your weaknesses first? I think you know the answer.2. Really good teachers. Rohit Sir is best possible teacher for quant. He lays down the basics of every topic in detail. His motto is “First have a really strong base, i will ensure you develop on speed.” One cannot expect a more sincere approach from any teacher, seriously.Abhishek Raj Sir is a par excellence English teacher. He's humorous, witty and very VERY thorough. You will never have any dearth of practice if you are in his class.Vaibhav Sir teaches us DILR. Again, very pleasant, kind and helpful like the others. Take special note of how he arrives at every conclusion, it is bound to help you excel.(You can see a full list of the permanent faculty and their credentials on MBAguru's website. )3. You'll get homework in every class. Without completing your homework, you cannot attend the next class, which is a good thing as this always keeps you on your toes. Abhilasha ma'am, our centre head is extremely nice too. She is the one responsible for keeping track of everything that is going on in that particular centre. And she does an amazing job of it.It has been only 4 months with MBAguru, and I can honestly say that I am very happy with my choice. Believe me, for i had zero confidence in myself before joining this institute. Mbaguru is helping me build my self confidence. Which is what I think gives this institute an edge over the others.All things said, everybody at MBAguru will give their 100% in helping you achieve your best. But it is you who has to ultimately do it. Do not expect things to magically turn around just by joining, it is your efforts ultimately that will matter the most because “one can bring the horse to the lake, but cannot force it to drink from it.”Hope this helps you all. Cheers! :)","My decision to join Alchemist was motivated by the results of a close friend of mine who had studied in Alchemist. From what I’ve heard and experienced, IMS, CL, Time, etc. are all identical - they'll have similar prep material, and a very archaic pedagogy of teaching which certainly works well for some no doubt. The concepts that they cover are limited to basic 10th grade math and the only take away from the class sessions are the solutions to the sheet problems. I don’t wish to contest the effectiveness of archaic methods of teaching widely adopted by other coaching institutes.I can however, vouch for Alchemist. It's different, it's very new and you certainly will learn something more than basic formulae, tricks and solutions. The one thing that stands out is their faculty - they're all IIM/FMS graduates (which is certainly not the biggest selling point, but yes that’s more of a parity that’s expected in the minds of the student who’s going for the classes). There is so much more you can learn from their conceptual clarity and personal experiences. I think that’s what worked for me as I felt good about the fact that there is immense personalization done not just in the coursework but also the interactions between students and teachers. It’s a great exactly of ‘to each his own’proverb wherein the progress path is tailor-made based on the student’s comfort level and ease of understanding. It’s an institute that takes pride in the kind of students it has mentored and helped clear CAT and not the number of students.An amusing thing was that the teachers at Alchemist can solve any question for you (including Algebra)without pen and paper and after their course even you will be able to do that(through some visualization technique)! All in all, I think a very important reason for me getting calls from all IIMs and eventually converting IIM Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta is Alchemist. Right from what kind of questions to attempt to and what not to attempt, how to approach a question,when to move to the next question, how to think, etc. - in every respect,Alchemist played a superbly crucial role for me in CAT 2014.I wish you all the best with whatever decision you make, for it is ultimately you who has to sit through the grind and not the coaching center or teacher.Choose wisely.Regards."
CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,How should I start my preparations for the CAT 2019 if I am weak in maths?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-start-my-preparations-for-the-CAT-2019-if-I-am-weak-in-maths,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",8,"As a rule, there is no distinction in the procedure and on the center territory between such competitors and others. There is a high number of such understudies each year who figure out how to split the CAT, notwithstanding not being from a designing/measurements/maths/scientific science foundation. In 2017, three non-building understudies got 100 percentile score in CAT. From here, it is very obvious that on the off chance that you plan hard, you additionally have a reasonable opportunity to get 99 or more percentile score in CAT.One should draw a limit among QA and maths. CAT requests just fundamental numerical aptitudes that we have learnt till class 10. CAT does not center around hypothetical thoughts but rather the use of essential ideas. This basically implies your insight into essential number-crunching and proportionality apparatuses, numbers, time speed remove, basic combinatorics, variable based math and geometry is all that could possibly be needed to enable you to split the test. The greater part of the issues present a dimension ground for everybody so there isn't a lot of leverage that engineers or other 'maths individuals' have. Most understudies escape and spotlight on 'exciting' ideas while dismissing more straightforward ones.Fundamental scientific expertise is only one component of the QA segment and alternate measurements are more vital. These are the capacity to perform in a weight circumstance, perception expertise, basic leadership, versatility/adaptability lastly a capacity to understand the inquiries.Tackling a CAT quant issue is a stepwise procedure and the fundamental calculation isStep-I: Comprehension of an inquiry,Step-II: Interpretation, that is, what is given and what is required et al.Step-III: Problem-unraveling (whenever required).Prior to moving to step-III, one ought to investigate every one of the conceivable outcomes of answer alternative disposal through different methodologies like perception or through discovering the scope of guesstimate esteems in the wake of dissecting the extraordinary cases. To teach the above arrangement of aptitudes, one needs to rehearse well. Time-bound practice will assist the understudies with understanding what ideas they require to return to. Set up a summary of equations subject insightful in a legitimate request. You have to likewise comprehend the confinements, conditions, under which these are substantial.","Hey Shubham Gupta !Thanks for A2A.CAT exam have not only maths (Quantitative Aptitude) but also have two more sections and we can divides this syllabus into 5 areas-Quantitative Aptitude (QA)Data Interpretation (DI)Logical Reasoning (LR)Reading Comprehension (RC)Verbal Ability (VA)Go through below given link where you will get topic wise syllabus of each area- CAT Syllabus 2018 - Complete Details of Topics required for CAT ExamIf we are talking about Quantitative Aptitude section, this section can be classified as follows-This section is widest area of CAT but You have studied all these topics of QA section in school time.

CAT demands only basic mathematical skills that we have learnt till class 10. CAT does not focus on theoretical ideas but the application of basic concepts.This essentially means that your knowledge of basic arithmetic and proportionality tools, numbers, time speed distance, elementary combinatorics, algebra and geometry is more than enough to help you crack the test.Most of the problems present a level ground for everyone so there isn’t much of an advantage that engineers or other ‘maths people’ have. Most students get carried away and focus on ‘glamorous’ concepts while neglecting simpler ones.Basic mathematical skill is just one dimension of the QA section and the other dimensions are more important. These are the ability to perform in a pressure situation, observation skill, decision making, adaptability/flexibility and finally an ability to comprehend the questions.Solving a CAT Quant problem is a step wise process and the basic algorithm isStep-I: Comprehension of a question,Step-II: Interpretation, that is, what is given and what is required.Step-III: Problem-solving (if required).Before moving to step-III, one should explore all the possibilities of answer option elimination through various approaches like observation or through finding out the range of guesstimate values after analyzing the extreme cases. To inculcate the above set of skills, one needs to practice well.Time-bound practice will help the students to understand what concepts they require to revisit. Prepare a compendium of formulas topic-wise in a logical order. You need to also understand the restrictions, conditions, under which these are valid.Preparation tips :1. Learn the theory from first principles :Make a conscious effort to learn theory from basic ideas. We have a tendency to 'jump' steps when we get familiar with a topic. Resist the temptation to use plug-and-play formulae and learn the theory with an open mind.2. Do 'the grind' :Do lots of practice. Intuition is important, but the ability to power through lots of questions is extremely vital. Major portions of the processes should be on 'autopilot'. Fatigue is an important factor in CAT and it is nearly impossible to be switched on for 140 minutes continuously. When confronted with a tricky question, if you pick the right approach after may be 60 seconds of thinking, the remaining 100 seconds of actually solving the question should be done in mechanical fashion; in a manner that does not take much out of you.More the processes on autopilot, the less tired you get, and therefore better the odds of 'cracking' the key idea behind the next question. To give a parallel, think about the time you tried to learn to drive a car (or ride a bike). In the first few instances, when the gear-clutch-brake mechanisms were still new, the experience would have been very tiring. Driving for even 30 minutes would have been exhausting. When the mind is processing that level of data, fatigue creeps in rapidly. But once you have done 200 kms on a vehicle, muscle-memory kicks in, the left hand and left leg move automatically, without having to be 'told'. Now, there is even bandwidth to speak on the phone while driving! Hands Free Please!3. Handle tougher questions by revisiting theory:Once you have learnt from first principles and done the grind, you would have learnt all standard templates. Now the knowledge base is set, it is time build the ability to 'discover' newer frameworks. Ask more fundamental questions and work with proofs and properties.","Hi Shubham GuptaYou have ample amount of time and hence my advise would be to start from the very basic level.Use R.S.Aggarwal books for learning basic formulas and solving easy aptitude questions. After finishing this book, refer “Handa Ka Funda” online course to smoothly sail through this CAT preparation journey. This course will help you rewind to any topic anytime which in turn will be a great boon for you to recollect any concept whenever needed. It also teaches each and every topic right from the primary level which is a great boon for beginners and non-math students.Focus on your English and fundamental aptitude skills. The following are the primary actions you will have to take and work on religiously:Polish primary Grammar rules (Refer “High School Grammar by Wren and Martin” for practice)The Articles – A, An, TheParts of SpeechSentence ConstructionModifiersSubject-Verb AgreementVerbs TensesMake reading newspaper and novels part of your daily routine.Spend 40 mins for reading articles and editorials from newspapers like ‘The Hindu’, Economic Times, Mint, etc.Read a novel for an hour, refer to -Recommended Books and Novels List that every MBA / CAT Aspirant Should Read. While reading, make notes of important/difficult words with its meaning, synonyms antonyms. This will further build vocabulary extensively useful in solving RCs.Use the books by Nishit Sinha and CL for practice.Spend 2 hours daily and by the end of June you should have completed the learning and practice part sincerely.Later start taking sectional mocks by TIME. Identify the weaker areas and practice rigorously. After you feel content, switch to taking full-length mocks. After taking a mock, scrutinize it carefully to find the reasons behind your mistakes. This method is largely useful in preparing yourself for the best.Tips:At the beginning of preparation, solve 2 RC passages every day without fail.After completing the whole syllabus of CAT start solving 5 DI questions and 3–4 RC passages every day. Keep taking sectional mocks daily until you attain the confidence with respect to each section.Spend at least 2 hours for preparation even if you are occupied for the day.Make notes along with practicing questions daily. Any sort of idea or new shortcut should be part of these notes.A quick revision in the early morning of the previous day preparation. This works wonders!Make use of each and every day with sincerity and devotion, success will be definitely yours.Hope this helps you. All the best!"
CAT,How can I crack the CAT 2017 in 8 months while working full time?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-crack-the-CAT-2017-in-8-months-while-working-full-time,"Cat 2017 Aspirant, CAT Preparation 2017, CAT (Common Admission Test) 2017, MBA Students, MBA Preparation, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Master of Business Administration Degrees, Exam and Test Preparation",29,"Irrespective of whether you are retaker or giving CAT for first time I will suggest you to go through following strategy-Take an diagnostic test for CAT(or solve past year paper) to know where you stand in terms of level of your Maths,English ,LR/DI . Its just like pre-board where you get to know your strong and weak areas and work upon them by the time before your main boards.You can maintain excel sheet and note down you strong and weak areas .You can mark areas which you are very good at green and area of improvement green.As far as book is concerned - I will suggest CBSE NCERT book for Maths,English and Arihant for LR/DI .Though Arun Sharma is good for Maths ,but given the level of quant in past two year . I wont suggest you Arun Sharma unlike past year where Arun Sharma was the must do book for CAT.Also start reading newspapers start with reading Hindu Editorials .You can move to reading economic times ,New York Times later on.Read ,read and read!! Trust me it helps a lot in CAT RC as well as non-CAT exam .As per last two years ,Level of CAT has gone down ,with easier level of questions of English and Maths . Though LR/DI is the area which will test you the most .And 6–7 months should be more than enough.As far as mocks are concerned i will suggest CL which are closet to CAT in terms of level of difficulty . You can try SIMCATs for Verbal . But a strict no for AIMCATs as they are way above the level of CAT. If you feel you need help in CAT coaching still…I will suggest you to enroll for Handa ka Funda ..Handa Ka Funda works primarily on a flipped classroom model. All the course contents are provided to the student in one go. He/She has complete freedom to study what he/she wants - when he/she wants.The fee is something around 5k-7k depending on the package you choose.And such sort of a model makes it enormously easy for the student to study because they can study at there own pace. Also, there are live classes on the weekend focus of which is primarily on the doubts that students get during their preparation.The level of mocks is at par with actual CAT . Ideally you should enroll for two mock test series CL and Handa ka Funda will definitely be my pick.Also don’t get disappointed with your mock exam score .Remember mocks are meant to prepare you well for D-day .It doesn’t give you the score you will get in the exam .So as long as you learn from the mistake and won’t make them again its fine. That should be fine for CAT preparation.Also ,CAT is highly unpredictable i will definitely suggest you to prepare for NMAT,SNAP,IIFT,TISS ,XAT ,MICA .SIBM,SCMHRD,IIFT,FMS,XLRI have no to very less weightage for academics score. If you score very high in their entrance exam . You do stand a great chance to make it even with average GD/PI .Make sure to work on your profile . A stellar profile gives candidates a lot to speak ,discuss in PI.As you are working I will suggest you to put 3–4 hrs in weekdays and 7–8 hours in weekends. Time wise division for topics you can decide for yourself.All the best!!!","I really love these questions that are posed something like this:“How can I crack CAT in <insert impossible time frame> while <insert very hectic situation> with <insert impossible schedule> by doing <insert impossible things>.”What’s the hurry? You can give CAT many times over many years, it’s not a one time exam. If you really want a good institute, you have to give it enough time and effort.The most important thing is practicing really hard and monitoring your performance. If you don’t succeed the first time, you most likely have not dedicated enough time to it or done it with enough diligence. A couple of attempts should be good enough to make it - just make sure you work hard and carve out enough time. If one year isn’t enough, usually two years will suffice.Just keep at it, and you will breakthrough or realise it’s not worth it. Don’t stress yourself too much.PS : People who say they have prepared in 4 months are just incorrect (but are not lying). They’ve been preparing slowly all their life, they just didn’t know.","Absolutely, u bet.I did it. Working full time in an IT company. Started preparing around March.

And am your average Joe.Key was to set small small targets and being largely consistent with them.I chalked out my month by month schedule till CAT in March itself, and was able to stick with it just by investing around 2 hrs everyday morning before leaving for office.It was not even tough/struggle enough. Consistency and daily/half weekly/weekly targets follow ups allowed me to complete my quant topics in approximately 3 months. Next 1 month was dedicated to LR-DI prep from previous year papers. Including festive occasions, moody breathing periods, and revision period, I was still left with 2 months dedicated entirely to test series.That's where I somewhere lost my track a lil. Got disheartened/demotivated by poor percentile show at initial few online mocks, in spite of knowing that the real results are mostly a lot different than the Institute mocks, having witnessed some of the cases myself. (Didn't join any Institute btw). Attempted just around 10 sectional mocks of quant and LRDI. Mocks are really instrumental to your performance on D Day. May be I might have been able to elevate my performance with more mocks, but as a life rule, no regrets. Try not to get demotivated, and give more mocks. Assessing mocks and your short comings in a mock are twice as important as giving one. I maintained an excel with different fields such as marks, percentile, error percentage, guess error percentage, weak areas, etc as my performance measures for mocks. Try to have one for yourself.Enjoy your office, and allow yourself breathing space everyday, while remaining sincere with your targets. A consistent and sincere person doesn't even need prep holidays for an exam like CAT. Once Again,Am your average Joe, who performed above average in MBA exams. Key is to set small targets and follow them sincerely.Recently gave my interview for the 9 new IIMs and boy, I was awesome ;)Best of luck and karma.","I think you should try some smart ways to crack CAT 2017 in 8 months while working full time.Smart Ways :-Attempt Maximum E-mock papers online2.

CAT,Is cetking a good institute for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//Is-cetking-a-good-institute-for-CAT,"CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching",10,"I got AIR 1 in CMAT ( Score 350/400) and I have seen lot of bootlickers after that.What I am writing is on the basis of my own experience with two cheats from cetking — rav singh and ketan kg.CETKING is Full of cheats. I tell you my experience with them. I have never been student of that institute but they are so shameless that used my name to make others fool. They need only one thing — money by displaying fake result.Kindly read below how I exposed CETKING'S fraud.******** Exposed Cetking*******I could have opted to remain silent and it would have made me rich too, but my values don't allow me to do this.I want to bring out the truth in front of you so that you don’t waste your parent’s hard earned money and your precious time… and may be your entire life…I know the consequences too that might happen to me after I post this and you guys will be able to figure out who will be behind all this.What I am going to talk about, needs a lot of courage. This post will shock you, as it shocked me when I heard that Rav Singh CETKING is using my name to misguide students.I got AIR 1 in CMAT 2017 and was fortunate enough to get into JBIMS, Mumbai. Before joining this prestigious institute, I DIDN'T TAKE ANY COACHING to prepare for my mba entrance examinations. All I did was burning the mid night oil. Those sleepless nights and I believe that the god has been kind to me to get AIR 1 in my first attempt.After CMAT result I came to know Rav Singh.He invited me to his 1 day workshop in pune. I went there for a day. Just for a day.(And I HAD HAD NO HELP FROM THAT ONE DAY WORKSHOP) and Now Rav Singh says that he will get the affidavit from court and prove I am his student. what All I have to say is that if you go there for 1 day then another person uses your name to run his business not because of the reason he helped me but because of the reason he couldn't give that result what he supposed to give. What an achiever !!And it didn't happen for the first time. I have visited say no to cetking facebook page which says it has happened earlier as well.On the very first day I met RAV Singh, I told him that I was not “Saleable”. When I came to know that he had been misguiding students saying that I was his student, I thought to share this with all the aspirants.I took NO HELP FROM HIM IN ANY WAY TO PREPARE for CMAT, I haven't even heard about it before.It is just a beginning of story. When I retrospect I realize what all had happened behind me. He is using my photo and writing name as Suhas instead of Saras so that anyone could not claim it that Saras didn’t take coaching. Moreover we were in touch through whatsapp but he blocked me from his facebook group name – target jbims dream team, so that I couldn't come to know how was he using my name.Yesterday when I talked to him about all of it he told he had no idea that he used my name and it was a printing mistake. A big liar. I found it in one of his posters too where my name and photo was there… Wow! Great..Another person Ketan from cetking kept on texting me on whatsapp to share my scorecard so that he could make students fool that I was CETKING students.Folks, there is big game going on by cetking to trap you in. If you join them once they think you are under them.He has blocked me from everywhere after this post and a lot of manipulation will be made to prove they were right.They are many and I am alone. Why am I exposing him- I don't want any one to spoil his career in false hopes.I have all the screenshots which I would have posted but those coward people blocked me from everywherr.Cowards block people.When I exposed him on social media He also made a fake receipt on which my name is there to misguide you all again. The coaching which begs outsiders to use their name to ruin career of students, can not be the one to select.It is all upto you guys. All is in front of you and you are brave and wise enough to take the decision what to choose and what not. I wish you all the best for the upcoming exams you are going to take. May your result make your parents feel proud of you. Stay healthy, stay happy and most importantly be yourself.In my opinion IF YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF THE COACHING WHICH STANDS ON FAKE AND PURCHASED RESULT, you can join cetking. You are in a better position to see what happens to your career then.","No. They are much into NMAT rather than CAT. Also the real thing is they have a facebook group by Rav or Raghav guy who shares question in the facebook as per their window. In this way they create a good result for NMAT which is truly unethical. Neither NMAT cares for such activities. They even changed their testing company but still the practice remains the same. Unfortunately Narsee Monjee is yet again creating another scam which they did few years back. It's true they will again say they have no hand in this. Now imagine if a teacher gives impetus to such activity, how great he is into his teaching practices. I am just being truthful here. Regards,Online Preparation Platform","I had 2 classes, both from Mr.Ketan, the one and only. First class, he talked for some 10 minutes about himself, his attitude towards the approach to exam, how we should think like him etc. He went for a phone call after 10 minutes. And the moment he went out, i was like wtf? True, he was in IIM trinity, he got amazing marks in verbal. But he is no tutor. The best thing he taught us is to never sit in his class.Anyway, i decided i’ll give him a shot, go with the flow and see if i should withdraw or not. The guy keeps saying f*ck, shit like that always as if he is teaching in a low standard local college. Anyway, i bypassed that too. I went with it. But there is a limit. The guy keeps slobbering about how he is the best in teaching what he teaches blah blah blah. My patience was starting to run out. He never stopped his show off attitude like ever. I have never seen a stupider class before. I kept thinking about what to do after the class ends-which coaching institute should i shift to? til the class ended. Right after the class ended i asked 2 completely stranger class mates what they felt. They said they are going to apply to some other institution on the way. I also thought I would do the same. Then i thought-this was the first class,maybe he was trying to break the ice. I’ll give one more shot. I did and i regretted in the first 5 minutes of his class. His classes ruined our mood so bad most of us lost mood in the other classes. I withdrew that day itself and told the admission office that his classes suck. They didn’t even flinch. Like they are used to this.Anyway the last part is the refund. They made me call several people on their management to get it back. When i said the reason, they were like “its your problem you can’t follow his class, you shouldn’t blame him”. Fine, its my fault, just give my money back. One week passed, no response. I went there again, called the management in front of them, still no response. I gave the 2 people at admissions a fair warning that i would take this up a notch. They were like “yeah sure go for it”.They will drag you and make you kiss their boots to get your own money back. I’m not sure if this is for entire management, but i would suggest everyone to join CETking if you have too much money with you and you want some of it to go away for nothing.P.S- I used to watch the YouTube videos by Rav sir and i never had a bad opinion about it.","Absolutely not! In fact, if you are in middle of listing down your options to consider, erase them out completely.You’ll know why in reading the experience down below. Of course, this is my experience and I am providing my viewpoint on basis of their content, authenticity and my perspective as a student.My list of options to consider in Mumbai Suburbs was:TIME - but the reviews had gone terribly bad for them in terms of teaching and holding classes. Plus, there was no communication with the centre head in terms of explaining their process. Since their staff wasn’t interested I just could not see how well it would even be with them later.IMS - Well, their batch was full and no batch was to begin within next 1.5 months.CET King - I happen to see their advertisement and went in to inquire. I met with a centre co-ordinator who conveyed himself as an ex-student there. He painted this rosy picture and their sample lecture was just nice. I decided to take the admission and went ahead on the part. Communication with him until then was prompt, nice and elaborate on all the questions and his personal experience.But everything changed right after the admission. The classes did not start on the mentioned date and I was regularly following up on when they will. Along with that, the first lecture was suppose to be my Mr. Rao, who happens to be head of the institute, which never happened when the classes began a week later.That day, the lecture time being 7.30am, I could see no soul - either from CETKing staff or any other student. All calls to the area head were in vain so I decided to call the admin I was in communication with and as I was doing, he suggested I wait. As conclusion, I waited and later in time the classes were cancelled.This again happened during the next scheduled lecture, where the professor did show up, late in time but the keys to the classroom were locked up in office which the prof. had no access to.Again, when the first lecture did happen, way ahead in days, the verbal ability lecture was conducted by a professor newly instated by CETKing and whose efficiency weren’t very proficient in English language. He suggested us to use notes of IMS, since they were much better that this classes.It was their policy that students could withdraw within 3 attending 3 classes. But by the first class itself, I was terribly upset and decided to withdraw my admission.I still feel so angry while narrating what happen afters. CETKing officials had no idea about the refund process and decided to speak me into staying put with them. After a BIG and FIRM “NO” they put me in touch with this official from Thane branch and I mention her because she has given me a hardtime like no other.During my whole discussion of refund, there was no communication from their end, “let me keep calling and once in a while CETKing will grace me with an answer” was their response. I thought taking up the communication with Institute’s head would be more professional but rather he turned out to be spineless and without any answer.Moral of the whole 2 months of refund communication being that they deducted Rs. 10k on pretext of generating login for online course (which I never received until very late in the refund process, when I asked them to submit an email or a letterhead message stating that they have deducted the said amount for enrolling into online course they never gave me that. This only reaffirmed by doubt of them conning me. But, I was drained in efforts and had to focus back to preparing for CET and CAT if I had to stay on the course and could not pursue the lethargic process of Consumer Redressal.I share this with you as a lesson learnt out of this loss. I had a bad way out, I hope you don’t. This can be tragic to the focus on preparing for a challenging exam and thus, please make a wise decision before moving ahead.As a tip from this lesson,a. Hold on to the admission fee until the first class, atleast.b. Ask recently passed out students about their experiences with some classes in your area. This is the best review available.c. Ask questions to the officials at class and the teachers.And,All the best!"

Undoubtedly, the CAT difficulty level is high. I mentioned some valuable points along with the strategy for preparation below,Preparation StrategyThere are no hard and fast rules that one can crack CAT if they start preparation very early. Some of them with just 2 months of rigorous preparation have been able to pull it off. Yes indeed. If you start early, you will have lots of time and can prepare with ease. If not, then it could be pretty strenuous but still you can pull it off provided that you have the sheer determination to do it so.Focus on the Basics/Fundamentals.Then increase the pace and also the level of your preparation.TargetTry to score a minimum of 95+ percentile in each and every section in CAT Exam to get calls from any of new IIMs. However, it is advisable to score 98+ percentile and above in each section to get calls from IIM-A,B,C. Kindly note that the CAT Scores is only one of the criteria used for the selection process and even with a very high percentile; there are no hard and fast rule that for sure you will get calls from old IIMs. My suggestion is that you try to score the maximum in the CAT exam. Still with a very high score, there is no guarantee that you will get selected.The reasons could be as mentioned below,Academics, Previous Work Experience, Diversity, Extra-curricular and your past performance. Please note that the selection is based on ’n’ number of factors and not the scores alone.Strong in Academics (Getting very high CAT percentile) but weak in personality development like lack of good effective communication skills (Includes Writing + Speaking Skills) might lead to student not doing well at all in WAT and PI.Each and every IIMs are autonomous institutions. They have their own criteria to select. So no one can question them when it comes to their credibility during the selection process.Overconfidence. Don’t be overconfident if you get 99 percentile in CAT. Please don’t forget that you have WAT and PI. Prepare well and give your best.Be careful at the time of personal interviews. Kindly respect and be very humble with the interviewers (IIM Professors). Don’t act way too smart and No Heropanti Please.Over smart. There might be many others like you who get selected. Even if they got 95 or say 97 percentile, they might run over you at the time of WAT and PI.Finally, the committee must feel convinced that you are the right selection for their prestigious institution and if they feel that you are not, then you are out.Simple strategies but could prove to be very effective:Please follow 20 mins strategy. Prepare seriously for 20 mins and then give a small break. Break depends as you can take a 1 min break to an hour. It solely boils down to you. With this strategy, even if you prepare for 10 times a day (10 x 20 mins = 200 mins = 3hrs 20 mins); then you would be able to put in 3hrs and 20 mins of valuable effort. More importantly, you will not have any starting problem as some students struggle to even start.Further, keep yourself fit by doing meditation, yoga and exercises like walking, running etc to keep yourself fit. Staying fit helps you in enhancing the body & mind and in turn helps in increasing the concentration level.Have a clear goal for your preparation. Work everyday with a plan. Systematic and consistent preparation helps you a lot. More importantly, learn it with passion. If you learn with passion, then you can enjoy studying and not creating self inflicted unwanted stress.Clear Plan and GoalI come across students at times who say that they want to do this and that and so on. Have a clear plan, stick onto your goal and learn with passion. You can then achieve what you want.Self Study or Joining Online/Classroom CoachingOne always has an option to go in for self study. But that requires a high level of self motivation, sheer hard work and lots of time to understand the concepts.In turn, if you join coaching institute, it really helps you as you get to learn from the expert faculty in respective areas and it helps you to save a lot of time, as understanding concepts can take time. Further, you tend to learn tips, strategies and short cuts from the faculties.Further for preparation, student can choose online coaching. But then, the rigor of online and classroom coaching definitely differs. Coaching institutes play an important role in imparting strategies and giving a systematic structure to the student.Other than this, student should be sincere to classes and must put the best effort as their is no substitute for hard work.Factors to be Considered for Classroom CoachingIf someone has to choose coaching institute, then the factors to be considered are1) Faculty profiles (that also include qualifications) [In my opinion, that's one of the most important factor],2) Small class size i.e Faculty : Student Ratio (Even this is a very important factor) [It is still fine if the class size is slightly large provided that very good faculties handle the class]3) Materials,4) Online Test Series (Since most of the exams are online),5) Training for Written Ability Test & Personal Interview,6) Post Counselling [To help students to choose the best of the B-Schools]Online test series, training for interviews, post counselling etc will be missing if you were to prepare on your own. It’s not how early you start or you prepare in a rush with few months to go, the most important thing is that you enjoy the journey & learn it with passion and work hard with clear goal of getting into the top B-Schools no matter what.Take Mock TestsFurther, take lots of Mock Tests (after your preparation) and do a lot of self analysis after each and every test. Through this, you would be able to analyze your strengths and weakness. More importantly, you will not repeat the same mistakes again.NOTE: SIGN Consulting has created a mark in the field of CAT Coaching because of it’s rigor and for the individual attention given to each & every student.

In the first week of November, do a comprehensive, topic-wise review of all the QA sections of the AIMCATs that you have taken since your last review.CAT: Crack the CAT!Test taking Tips Finally, let us look at some test-taking tips for maximising your scores during tests. When it comes to a test-taking approach, one of the most important aspects you should remember is that there will always be a certain number of direct or simple questions in the QA section that are easy and doable, and identifying and cracking such questions is a major part of the challenge. Here are some practical tips that will help you during the exam time.First, be disciplined and focussed in your approach, as it will help you maintain a cool head and give you much required control and confidence during the CAT. Often, a lack of discipline is the greatest negative factor that could pull down one’s performance.Second, remember that there are no marks for trying and neither are there any extra marks for solving more difficult questions. Hence, make sure you do not waste your time on questions that seem either difficult or unfamiliar – you can always return to such questions, time permitting.When you are tackling the QA section, approach the questions in a group wise manner. This means that you first read through a group of four to five QA questions at a time, by using the ‘next’ and ‘previous’ buttons in the online interface, before actually delving into any of them. This will help you choose the right question(s) to attempt, and thereby help you optimise your time and number of attempts. Out of about five questions, consider attempting just around two or three questions. Consider attempting more only if you find them really easy.Also, while attempting any question, first put down all the given information in a structured manner, after which you will be in a position to decide whether you can proceed further or whether you should leave that question and move on. Try to check for alternative approaches like elimination/substitution of choices, which often save a lot of time and pay rich dividends. These can be mastered only through practice. Further, an important aspect of the CAT is the on-screen calculator provided during the test. While the utility of the calculator in a section like QA would be much less when compared to a section like DILR, there may still be some questions where using the calculator would help save time, if not completely solve them. In order to make the most of the features, you should ensure that you get enough practice with it.You should also actively mark questions for review, if you think that you may be able to solve them with some more effort, so that, time permitting, you could come back to look at them. This way, you would be working through the 34 QA questions in around seven groups of about five questions each. And each group should take you about 5 to 6 minutes, on an average, thereby completing one round of the section in 35 to 40 minutes. And by then you would have attempted anywhere from 14 to 18 questions already, with at least another 20 minutes or so to return to the questions marked for review. In fact, this strategy of managing about 15 to 20 minutes of spare time will work wonders for you if you implement it well, wherein the extra time at the end could also bring another 8 to 10 questions into Play at - development in progress the end of the day, you need to remember that a level- and cool-headed approach will make all the difference. So, give it your best and do not worry too much about the result, at least not while you are taking the exam!Best wishes from all of us at T.I.M.E.!"
CAT,What is more important in the CAT mocks: percentile or actual score? What should be taken as a parameter for judging the performance?,https://www.quora.com//What-is-more-important-in-the-CAT-mocks-percentile-or-actual-score-What-should-be-taken-as-a-parameter-for-judging-the-performance,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",5,"It depends.Percentile and actual score both are important in case of CAT mocks.If number of mock takers are more and the difficulty level of mock is upto actual CAT paper than both percentile and actual score is important. If number of test takers are less than actual score is only important.A lots of mock test series available in market and all aspirants not enrolled with same test series so we can not give more importance to percentile. So finally i can say “Actual score is more important in CAT mocks”.Analysis yourself by mock test is the most important thing. You can identify your weak and strong area by these mocks. There are many Mock test series available now the days who give the complete analysis of your mock like weak area, strong area. Click on the give link- Mock Test Series for CAT, XAT, NMAT, SNAP, IBPS PO and SBI PO . This mock will provide a complete analysis after every mock.Analysis every mock on your side also and Keep following points in your mind during this-Focus on the number of errors made. Try to minimize errors, they don’t have more than 2 in QA section, not more than 2 in LRDI section, not more than 20% in VARC section. If you are doing more error than this number means you are also attempting those question also whom your are not 100% sure.Look beyond scores and percentiles. Score and percentile is just a number, they might make you feel good or bad but you have to look beyond this.Attempt the entire paper again. An average CAT aspirant attempts 50–60 question in mock mean they have miss out a large number of good questions. Re-attempt it again without time pressure.Analyze your question, set, passage selection. After re-attempt the mock evaluate yourself on those parameters- Did I attempt the correct questions in Quant?, Did I pick the right sets in LR/DI?, Did I pick the right passages in RC? etc in my first attempt.Identify the strategy that works best for you. Follow a strategy that will help you to solve more question. According to me attempt every section in two phases. In phase 1 attempt all easy question that you can solve easily in less time and mark those question that can be solved by you but they take more time. In phase 2 attempt all marked question. This strategy will sure you that you don’t leave any easy question.Figure out the number of mocks you need. Attempt at-least 10 mocks before CAT exam.Do not attempt section wise mock. Always attempt full length mocks. Because full length mocks will feel you actual exam not section wise mock.Identify your weak areas. After analysis 2–3 mocks, you will identify your weak areas and than work out on that before attempting next mock.Check if you are slipping in your strong areas. Some time this happen when you are over confident on your strong area and don’t give enough time to this. You can identify this during identify weak area. This should not be happen, if this is happen than work out on it also.Plan your next mock. After a mock analysis you can allot time for your weak area, other thing etc than schedule next mock.If you are looking Online Course for CAT preparation than go through this link- Online CAT Coaching Course for CAT 2018 Exam PreparationGood luck for your bright future.Jai Hind!","A2AStandalone, neither is of absolute importance in my opinion.As is the case with CAT, the mocks also tell you where you stand with regard to the test taking population. However, the sample set is so concentrated that it is impossible to draw valid conclusions from your mock percentiles alone. The number of serious takers forms a big percentage of the total number of people taking mocks (roughly 50% or even more if fewer people are taking a test). In case of the CAT however, there will be around 75–80 percent of the population that doesn’t prepare seriously in any capacity. So, while you might start from a 50 percentile level in your mock, you effectively start at a 75 percentile level at the CAT.With regard to absolute scores, it completely depends on the level of difficulty of each section and while most of the mocks tend to be close to the previous CAT, or slightly tougher, there would generally be a few mocks that try to sensitize you to uncommon scenarios (which, is of course a good practice because you never know what the CAT would look like that year). So, again we cannot really say that if you get X marks in a mock, it would translate into a Y at the CAT.The takeaway in my opinion is more of decision making than anything else. Throughout the mock taking phase, your focus should be on identifying easy and difficult questions as quickly as possible thereby optimizing the time you would have. The content part plays a support role in making sure that you solve the easy and moderate questions using the shortest possible method. The best candidates out there are the ones who can decide extremely quickly if a question deserves their attention or not (in fact that was exactly the theme of CAT 2018 in case you haven’t seen the analysis yet).So, to sum it up, try to build at least basic content before the mock season starts (you might want to attempt a handful of past CAT papers to understand what all topics are frequently tested) and test your decision making in the actual mocks. As you progress, you can improve your preparation from a section level (for example: VA/QA/LR is my strongest/weakest section) to a topic level (for example: PnC/Geometry/Numbers is my strongest/weakest topic) to a question level (for example: replacement in a mixtures question is something I am not comfortable with).Hope that helps.","Hi SamridhiI believe two things that matter the most in tracking one’s performance are:PercentileAccuracyScore can fluctuate based on the level of the paper but the percentile should remain consistently at the required mark as per your preparation and expectations or go higher as per plans. Similarly, number of attempts can go up or down depending on the level of the paper, but what matters most is your accuracy. Not saying these parameters are the only ones that matter: speed, selection, number of attempts etc. are also important; but my top two picks to monitor one’s performance are percentile and accuracy.Best wishesIf you want to attend a CAT 19–20 strategy meet in Delhi, you can join this event: Invitations, Free eCards and Party Planning Ideas from Evite","The score matters more than the percentile. The percentile is based on what others do. And, the students who take mocks of a certain institute can not accurately reflect the those who are going to take the actual CAT.And, when you look at the score , you realize that there is always a scope for improvement. It always keeps on your toes. It makes you strive harder and harder.So the score matters more…But ultimately the analysis of your performance matters more than the score. Knowing the mistakes that you have done in mocks will help you do better in the actual CAT."
CAT,Which is the best MBA/CAT coaching institute in Noida?,https://www.quora.com//Which-is-the-best-MBA-CAT-coaching-institute-in-Noida,"MBA Preparation, CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching",18,"Well it all depends on what works for whom. There are few popular classroom coaching in India like TIME,IMS,CL etc . When I first decided to appear for CAT , I joined one of these just going by name . But it was a disaster for me as I was weak in Maths and they don’t focus on building basic concepts . Their module is formula based learning. Hence performed very badly in CAT .After failing badly , I had lost all the strength . But I decided that I am gonna give one more try . This time around I joined SMARG Education after getting good review from a friend who was studying there and taking few trial classes .It turned out to be a gamechanger for me and I scored 98.56 in CAT . Differences that I have noticed between these two institutes:-SMARG :-They give a lot of stress on concept building . Here the teachers are student friendly and has an impeccable way of teaching specially Maths faculty Achal sir. He has a strong belief that 90% of the CAT questions can be done by simple logic and common sense ,to which I agree to an extent by giving CAT two times.Achal sir classes made Quants and DI/LR seem like a cake walk. Not a single verbal class with Nishant sir went by without learning a number of interesting words and their etymology.The most imp. thing I like about this institute is that an aspirant can attend any number of classes till his concepts are crystal clear and full support till CAT.Popular Institutes for CAT :- Focus on ruttafication and not on building concepts.The teachers give a new formula in every question and learning so many formulas is not practically feasible for a Student Housing Made Easy • Student.com offer only limited classes in the timeframe of 3 months. whether one understands anything or not. They will not entertain you after the completion of your course .So I request you all to make decision wisely and join SMARG Education . Joining these popular institutes like TIME, CL ,IMS is a waste of time and money and it can hamper your preparation and make this exam seem like Mt. Everest.I hope this will be useful . All the best !!!!!","In case you want to join any coaching Institute, I will suggest you to join MBAGURU, It has maximum students clearing CAT exam in terms of Percentage. Very qualified faculty. FEES is also very reasonable.For any aspirant, the following factors are of prime importance when it comes to joining a coaching institute:1. Personal Attention - I think the most important factor is this. If personal attention and mentoring is missing, don't join. When you are evaluating institutes, go and check their classrooms for batch size. Ask for a demo session, if possible. Go and take a demo class you will realize why i am suggesting MBAGURU2.Faculty - In addition to point 1, look for faculties who have gone through the whole process as they can understand you better and guide you better. Ask for faculty details. See if you can talk to them.3. Content/Material/mocksContent/Material/mocks -At MBAGURU content is getting frequently updated to match the recent trends. As I said, not a differentiating factor. Mocks used to be a differentiating factor, go and visit mbaguru Site.4.In MBAGURU you will get ample of materials to practise. There will be regular classes and after the completion of the class you will be given handouts which will comprise of the same thing taught in class . You should manage your time so well that you should practise every material. The study material are designed in such a way that it matches with CAT level. Believe me if you just do the study material religiously you will surely score more than 90 percentile.Besides that you will be given sectional tests which will be little advanced .Clearing your doubts is another important thing to follow every timeMBAGURU focuses even on other exams like IIFT, SNAP, NMAT, XAT etc and regular mocks and revision sessions help the students perform better in these exams as each and every exam is a different ball game and needs a different strategy to excel.As the number of students is less there is a personal bond between the students and the mentors and this makes the faculty members very much approachable.MBAGURU WILL HELP YOU IN ANALYZING ……….What are your areas of strength?For Example, Quant is your area of strength. Jolly Good!! Which subjects do you excel in Quant. Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry ?? Make sure you score cent percent in them. What are your areas of weakness?? Probability. Make sure you learn the basics to exploit the low hanging fruits.What are your areas of weakness?For example, VA (verbal ability). Which parts do you score in VA. Synonyms/Antonyms, Paragraph reading, Sentence corrections. Awesome!! Concentrate only on these areas and make sure this is enough to cross the line.Enroll for a test package.Give each test as if it the d-day. Determine time allocations as per your comfort. I generally follow 30–30–30–10 rule. 30% of time per each section to cross the line and final 10% of time to maximize my score.Your preparation doesn't end here. It starts now. After each test, go through each answer diligently. This helps you evaluate your strengths and weakness.For example, you fumbled with Data sets. Great!! Go back to basics. Read and solve everything you can lay hand on for the next one week. Your aim for the next test should be zero mistakes in Data sets.On a normal basis, your All India percentile in these tests is more or less your upcoming CAT score unless you somehow achieve super powers on the D-day and perform exceedingly well. Believe in yourself.Aren’t you convinced yet. Well, that’s how I made it during my CAT being an average student, from an average college.And its a separate ball game altogether, if you are talking about GDPI","Before joining any institute I will suggest you to do your own background research on all top Institutes.  The criterias on which one should choose a coaching institute:1. Faculty : This is the most vital element while going for an institute. There are many institutes, who have average to mediocre faculties and hence the quality of education goes down drastically. I did my own research and find out very few institutes in Noida and near by area like GZB and Greater Noida have faculties from top b-schools. Most of them have same faculties for all courses like BANK, SSC and CAT. One institute, which stands out, in this case is, TIME Greater Noida. It's a relatively new institute compared to its peers but the institute has faculties only from top B-Schools like (IIM Calcutta, XLRI, IIM Bangalore, IIM Lucknow, FMS and etc.).  It has a perfect combination of young and experienced faculties (couple of faculties have 25+ years of teaching experience in India and Abroad) 2. Study Material: There are very few top coaching institutes in India for CAT preparation. I will just put down the names based on my personal experience.A. TIMEB. CLC. IMSThese 3 are at top but TIME study material stands out. This material gets updated every year and also based on the exam pattern changes. 3. Test Series:Ask anyone on this and they will all tell you go for AIMCAT. For years AIMCAT has the maximum number of exam takers. Every 2 CAT applicants out of 3 registered for AIMCAT test series. The test series gives you a perfect flavor of the real race, CAT. The percentile also gives you a rough estimate on where you stand at national level.","While searching for “the best” CAT coaching institute first the parameters to judge the best should be defined clearly. Broadly the parameters are:1.Teachers’ profile2. Classroom attention3.Regularity of classes and syllabus completion4.Test SeriesKeeping in mind the above three parameters every coaching institute tries its best to deliver their best but in my opinion Career Launcher is the best place to go. The reason for that is explained as follows:If you have to master Karate you will reach out to the one who has already expertise in it and not any beginner. The teachers of CL are from top B schools of India and are experts in their respective fields.Contrary to the other institutes the number of students in the class is limited that is why personal attention per student increases. Also the doubt solving by teachers is quick and prompt. The style of teaching varies from centre to centre but the quality of teaching remains constant. Various Workshops of Verbal and DILR are organised from time to time to make learning more interesting and objective.The syllabus is completed timely because the classes are regular. If in rare case any faculty is not able to reach any particular day, substitute sessions are organised in order to maintain the regularity of class.The most important part of the preparation is taking online mocks and practising to read more online. CL has best test series which is very close to the difficulty level of CAT. Apart from this the Test Gym provides student to master and prepare topic wise with the class speed.Therefore it is the CAREER LAUNCHER where one should go if he/she is eyeing top B schools in the world."
CAT,How good is Indrajeet Singh's Iquanta CAT preparation coaching?,https://www.quora.com//How-good-is-Indrajeet-Singhs-Iquanta-CAT-preparation-coaching,"CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching",33,"Iquanta is possibly the biggest scam in the history of online coaching. All thanks to their so called mentor Indrajeet Singh, now no one really wants to believe the concept of Online coaching.I don’t have experience with rest of them but I can give you a first hand idea about how things work in Iquanta. After that you can judge if you’ll convert ABC or land in IBS(Not ISB).Having been associated with them for 3 years in the main group & as a student in this batch, I have seen good faculties joining Indrajeet and then leaving him because of his dirt cheap activities of firing them in greed of more money.Even this year he promised us Anuj Sinha who happens to be one of the best faculties or I should say x faculties at Iquanta during the initial demos for LRDI. And now we are standing in middle of no where with Anuj getting fired and no content in hand of last 15 classes.So if you summarize its one of those failed startups who have no good product, are in habit of duping their customers & are on verge of being shut down!The best part is when you ask for refund his team of 30 interns, few of whom have answered here to promote him would delete your posts immediately.So if you want to prepare seriously, go for something you can actually trust. And if you are well prepared of screwing up cat 17,18 and so on. Be IQUANTA’s guest.Here is an example of what he does when someone posts about his activities -One moment your post is here:Next Moment, the post is gone!Good luck!","Being a current Student of Iquanta and a member of the Facebook group CAT preparation- Iquanta , I think I am equipped to answer this question more.Now what is Iquanta and why is everyone talking about it.Iquanta is an online coaching platform which mainly focuses on MBA competitive exams like CAT, IIFT, XAT, TISS , NMAT, SNAP, etc. Its basically divided into two main Fb groups - 1) CAT preparation- Iquanta (which is a Public group for all CAT aspirants) and 2) Paid courses of Iquanta ( which are held in secret groups and sessions and are taken by expert faculties).Now who is Indrajeet Singh ?A Young boy who started his Journey from school by helping his peers and other students , is the brain behind Iquanta and CEO of Iquanta.Popularly known as the Wizard Of Quant,He is the main Quantitative aptitude Faculty Of Iquanta. He can literally solve most of the complex quant problems in a matter of seconds. He is a teacher, a mentor, an entrepreneur and most importantly a great friend.Talking from the first hand experience his sessions are the best and are very interactive. His different approaches of teaching concepts and methods are impeccable and beyond comparison.Now what makes Iquanta different from other courses in the market, here are some points:Ease of access- What differentiate Iquanta from its competitors is that classes in Iquanta takes place through secret Facebook events and groups which can be accessed anytime, anywhere and even from your mobile phones. The best part about Iquanta is that these classes takes place between 10 pm to 12 am, so not only the undergraduate students but working professionals also can easily access these classes and benefit from them.And if by chance you are not able to attend any class, Don’t worry Iquanta has got you covered as these classes stay in those events for unlimited time.Not only Videos that are being used by conventional online coachings , Iquanta also uses fb events, sessions, images and fb live events as a medium of teaching.24*7 Doubt clarification and Peer learning- Since , classes are being held on Facebook one can easily post their doubts and these doubts are answered by faculties within minutes. Most of the time these doubts are also cleared by fellow aspirants which promotes group learning and leads to multiple approaches for the same problem , saving time and effort, which is very important for an examination like CAT.Faculty- Well, one of the most crucial factors of any coaching is its faculty members because either they can make an institute or destroy it. Most of the faculty members of Iquanta are 100 percentilers themselves and some of them even have 10 years of experience in their respective fields.Every faculty member gives their best in clearing all doubts in the most simplest way possible.Indrajeet singh has its own style of teaching and has even derived his own formulas for most complex of problems which saves a lot of time on D-day.Numerous sessions and tests- Iquanta offers you from time to time various opportunities to check your preparation through various competitive mini and mock tests. These tests are not only at Par with the actual CAT but also helps in gaining that extra push that is required to nail CAT.Just for your reference I am adding - Iquanta provides 2500 plus Cat level questions with 80 sessions on quantitative aptitude, 60 sessions on Verbal ability and 60 LRDI sessions . Last Mile to CAT is usually the name of the event that is taken by faculties 15 days prior to CAT in which all past CAT questions and CAT level questions are practiced again in order to brush up concepts again and giving Iquanta students an edge over others.Moreover, I have seen no other institute that offers motivation sessions to their students from time to time, whenever they feel low or depressed. Even now after the declaration of CAT results these sessions are being conducted by Indrajeet.Affordability and Results- What makes Iquanta an ideal choice is that they are offering all of these things at a price range of Rs. 5000 to 14000 which makes it quite affordable as compared to offline coachings that costs from 50k to 60k.Students can also choose from Individual packages of Quant, Verbal ability and LRDI according to their need which costs around 5000 each.Now here comes the most Important factor, that is the Result record of Iquanta :Following its past records this year also, Iquanta has proved itselfCAT 17 - 100 97+ percentilers and 40 99+ percentilers.I, Understand it depends from person to person and on one’s preparation level but I have actually seen people going from being 60 or 70 percentilers to 90 percentilers after joining Iquanta . I would highly recommend to join these courses as soon as possible in order to get the most out of it.For further information- CAT Preparation - IQuantaI hope this helps you all in making the right decision, All the Best!!","REALLY GOOD, No doubt in it.I have been hearing a lot of buzz lately among all the new online coaching start ups and so I finally decided to write down hoping it might help a few. I have had the experience of Iquanta and I have to say its the one stop solution for anyone aspiring a great score! I will state the reasons below.Indrajeet Singh The very first reason is him. Yes, he is more of a support, guide and a friend than a teacher. The best part is he’s 24*7 there for all his students in case of any doubt or help.Quality : You will come to know about his tips and tricks which are designed by him and not copied plainly from elsewhere. The way he teaches and relates the concept so something that we can remember is commendable.Facebook Events : I have to say this is the most effective way of studying in a group that I have discovered. No noise, no disturbance, no unwanted notifications and a bunch of people as enthusiastic and energetic as you.SO AFFORDABLE : This is pretty self explanatory. What else does one need? This was my personal say above but you can find some links which can be more useful to you in case you want to know some more facts. Also, would like to mention that there were 100 IIM converts in CAT15, 17 99.6+ percentilers and two 100 percentiler in Cat 2015.

Nothing and I say that with utmost adamancy can help you more in your CAT preparation. And I've learnt this fact only after appearing for the exam myself. No matter how many books or coaching modules you solve, the practice of taking mocks will only prove fruitful.Join an online test series,make a schedule for taking mocks,appear for a test,wait for the result (the immediate result will provide you with just the marks,the detailed analysis provided later is consequential),try solving the paper untimed and analyse your result by investing a good 3–4 hours, note your conceptual errors and list them out,work on the list.Taking a mock will point out your weak areas which you can master with the help of various online lectures available. Also appear for the sectional tests of these weak areas. Appearing for 80–85 mocks on an average before THE day is the key to your desired percentile.Suggested online test series-TIME's AIMCAT test seriesCL's test series (variants are available)P.S- Going for mocks by different portals at random might also help but do try to complete the test series you join.Also do prepare a formula notebook for all the QA formulas and tricks for the DI-LR section.

CAT,How should I start my preparation for CAT-2019?,https://www.quora.com//How-should-I-start-my-preparation-for-CAT-2019,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",69,"Hello Folks!Thanks for A2AAs you have more than one year for CAT-19 preparation, you should make sure that you make a very strong platform to nail the exam! It is in mastering basics that the key to CAT prep lies.So, how to prepare?Before starting your preparation, go through the syllabus and exam pattern once. The syllabus is divided into three sections-Verbal Ability and reading comprehensionData Interpretation and Logical ReasoningQuantitative AbilityRevising your basics well is the most important part of your preparation. Only after you clear your concepts, you can do well in CAT. Complete the basics(chapter wise). Most CAT chapters are from your high school syllabus(class 8–9–10). Revise them all properly. Additionally, do lots of CAT relevant reading; daily newspaper(The Hindu, Economic Times, NYT etc.), magazines or any random articles on philosophy and psychology from wikipedia. You can also read non fiction novels and follow management blogs to nourish your reading habit. This will help you a lot in building higher speed and comprehension for CAT. You should also build good puzzle habits! Solve crossword and sudoku from a good English daily on a regular basis. This will sharpen your mind for CAT.Your motive should be to revise the concepts and to overcome the fear of certain topics if you had them during your school days. Some students never liked Geometry in school; some were never good in reading; some had issues with permutation combination - These issues need to be tackled first. Get over your fears in the first 4–5 months of your CAT 2019 preparation. This is the key to gaining confidence and also to perfect competition. A good CAT learning module with CAT experts can help here.Post covering your basics, your focus should shift on learning the best methods to solving CAT level questions. At my coaching (Bfactory), we focus on these major aspects:1. Value putting2. Option elimination3. Speed reading4.Structuring of information5.Shortcut methodsYou should try to think faster and sharper than before.6–7 months before CAT, start giving topic and sectional tests and solve advance level questions as many as you can. Be disciplined in your efforts and you will feel the change in your aptitude levels by this time!Give your last few months in giving full mocks and do complete analysis of your mocks. Analysis of mocks will help you point out your weaker sections and the areas where you do silly mistakes. Once you know your weak areas your task is to work upon them to convert them into your strong areas. Practice more questions until you excel in those topics. Testing makes perfect in a competition.CAT preparation is like a Marathon; start well and keep moving! Make sure you finish well!Kamlesh Sir(IIM Ahmedabad) and I are in Delhi for a CAT meet up(informal career chat over coffee at CCD, Connaught Place) on 14th July. If you want to meet up and discuss CAT prep, click on this link:Invitations, Free eCards and Party Planning Ideas from EviteHappy learning!Rahul SirCAT Coachwww.bfactory.in","CAT is generally conducted on last Sunday of November. So it is safe to say there are 50 weeks for CAT-2019. The time is sufficient for anyone to prepare for CAT and get excellent score, provided he/she is dedicated and ready to work hard. People with good basics would be having an obvious advantage. Those who are not good with basics can bridge the gap given the time for CAT-2019.Let’s discuss how should one approach for CAT-2019. We can briefly divide preparation in 2 parts- one is actual CAT exam and profile.1.Profile-Your profile consists of your curricular and extra-curricular achievements, your hobbies, interests and expertise if any. Your 10th/12th/grad score are important. If you have a good score there it gives you an edge. In case if they are not too great, there are many thing that can be done for building your profile. You can’t go back to change those scores so don’t waste your time worrying about it. Do various certifications(related to your field of interest can be preferred), social work, have a hobby/field of interest. It can be anything so find what you are interested in. Work Experience is also important part of your profile.2. Actual CAT-From past 3 years the pattern of CAT is almost same. So it is safe to assume that there won’t be any major changes next year too. But keep yourself prepared for various situations. We can say there will be 3 sections again.1.VARC(34 questions)- VARC or English section is generally said to be easy or moderate section. But it is important that you score as many marks as you can in this section.RC- Out of those 34 questions 24 questions are asked on RCs. There are 5 passages in total having length of roughly around 650–700 words. Trust me, you won’t need reading speed of 220/250 wpm, If you read the passage in 5 mins and answer questions in next 5–6 mins, that is sufficient. For that start reading. Read good news papers then move on to better ones. Read not only novels but also autobiographies and books about technical things. Try to make yourself comfortable with as many topics as you can because we never know RC related to which topic might appear in the CAT.VA- For VA Parajumbles, out-of-context, summary are hot topics. Prepare for those topics. When you are reading try to focus on how the sentences are connected to each other. Write the summary of the articles you read. It will definitely help you. Also build vocabulary. Even if there aren’t any direct questions in CAT, it will help you in understanding passages. They generally use few tricky words. Also prepare grammar/sentence correction and critical reasoning. In case these questions are asked you must be familiar with those topics.2.DILR-(32 questions)- Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning is notorious for its difficulty level. Solving 16 questions correctly gives you 99 percentile in most of the cases. But there are 5–6 doable sets in this section. All you need is proper set selection and ability to face the pressure of the exam. There is always a set on Venn Diagram(generally higher difficulty). Practice all the direct topics but we can’t expect direct sets in this section. So as soon as you are done with it try solving sets from previous CATs, Solve 3–4 sets daily. That is sufficient for his section.3.Quant-(34 questions)- It is the only section that has predefined syllabus. It is dependent on high-school mathematics. Start working on those concepts. Make yourself comfortable in the topics of higher importance. Nothing can be said about difficulty level of the paper so be prepared. Try to make your own shortcuts and use the methods which you find easy. Try to list all the formulas and don’t just keep them on tip of your tongue. Also learn how to apply them. Try to find out shortest methods for the problems you solve. It would save your time.Few general tips- Join 1–2 good test series. You’ll find 2017/2018 CAT papers online. Solve them after you are prepared well. Try to find strategies which work for you. CAT is not difficult to crack if you are prepared well.All the Best!!Cheers!!","I hope this answer sorts out most of your queries !First thing that peeps in is , When do i begin :Cat has a very limited course and so you need around 2–4 months to cover the complete course. Then it's all about practice and practice.Also , cat is not about giving a fixed set of hours. It's about practicing something daily and consistently.What temperament should i have:You need to get passionate about quants, lrdi and english, so passionate that you see questions around you , from adding up your grocery bill to calculating the percentage of your attendance.Considering specific sections:English: Divided into two halves RC and VA and comprising of 34 questions (24 in RC and 10 in VA ). The RC questions have negative marking while the VA section is non negative.RC's are all about elimination. You eliminate the three choices and get the correct one. Make sure you practice variety of passages and at least 5 passages daily. VA Section , it is non-negative , but that's​the catch. People get lured by it and end up wasting a lot of time and energy.Advise: Do check what your accuracy is in VA section , if it is less than 50% , it is advisable not to spend much time in VA or attempt selective questions only .QA: Comprises of 34 questions ( Integer type as well non integer types ). Quants section is getting easier each year since CAT wants to reduce engineers ( quants has been the strength of engineers).For preparation, these are the topics : Percentage, Ratio and Proportion , TSD , Number system , Geometry , Algebra , P&C. Put extra effort on percentage and ratio and proportion because they form the backbone for quants as well as lrdi. Make sure you do all the questions with a timer.LRDI: Comprises of 32 questions divided into 8 sets of 4 questions each. Getting proficient in percentage and ratio and proportion does half the job.Out of the 8 sets , five sets are easy and your work is to find out those sets. Furthermore , you need to practice diverse sets and make sure you are accurate.Books for each section :Cat is not about going through lots of materials, it's more about practice.Either buy correspondence material from CL or Time ( Cl preferred because they have more precise and better explained material ). That costs around 6k. You can buy books by Arun Sharma , he has compiled for all three sections. That would cost you around 1500 bucks.Best test series :I feel Time’s test series are the best series . They bring in a lot of variety , as well as their solutions are very elaborate and comprehensive in nature.In addition, they give you all the stats including how many students gave the tests which no other coaching gives. Also, they have the advantage of large user base.What should be done now:Be calculative, calculate every second , like a baniya ( it's a caste ).Calculate manually on every occasion you have , whether adding up your grocery bills to calculation of taxes at hotel bills to random numbers addition. Make yourself extremely good with numbers.Try doing puzzle solving and develop reading as a hobby ( they will help you forever.)Cheers!!","CAT is not only about giving entrance exam, you need 2 years to prepare yourself for MBA. Entrance test is the easiest part among the steps involved in MBA.Things you should start doing-1- Start reading Newspaper daily ( atleast 2 and read opinion and business page)2- Start building your resume (Do certifications, join NGO, Write research papers and articles)3- Start working on your Hobby and answer to “tell me about yourself”4- Identify your weak areas and forte.5- Then devise a strategy to improve your weak areas and refine your areas of excellenceYou can also join my FB page CAT / XAT / IIFT - MBA Prep, Log into Facebook | Facebook for concept notes, questions and strategies.You can ask any doubt that you have and it will be answered."
CAT,"During the analysis of my CAT mock, especially for quant, I am able to solve 22-26 questions, but while taking the mock, I am stuck to 10-12 questions. How can I improve?",https://www.quora.com//During-the-analysis-of-my-CAT-mock-especially-for-quant-I-am-able-to-solve-22-26-questions-but-while-taking-the-mock-I-am-stuck-to-10-12-questions-How-can-I-improve,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",8,"Thanks for A2A Gaurang.You need to read the questions fast in the exam hall. Immediately leave the question if you are not sure of how to solve it post the first reading. Do not try to understand by investing more time on it.Doing this, run through the paper till the end. You would have selected all easy ones for you and solved them. On this ruthless journey to the end, you should bookmark the questions that you think you can solve but can be time consuming. Get back to these question if time permits.If you follow this basic process, you can get up from 10–12 to 18–20 questions. The key lies in not wasting time on the questions that need to be left - the difficult ones for you. Let me illustrate this doing some basic maths.Suppose, you read and double read questions to try to solve them. You read 26 questions - solve 12 and leave 14 after trying to solve them. So, effectively 60/26 => 2.3 minutes per question (assume same time for both solved and unsolved/wrong ones) => 14*2.3 approx 32 minutes wasted.So, the key lies in spending time on those questions which you can solve and immediately leaving the ones that confuse you in the hall. Practice this. Being conscious about fast selection leads to lots of improvement in attempts and accuracy both.My team and I will be discussing mock analysis in details in this free all India mock series for CAT 2018. You can register for this prediction mock series on this link:CAT 2018 Feel CAT SeriesBest wishes!Rahul SirCAT Coachwww.bfactory.in","A2AThe only difference between solving questions after the test and during the test is the accompanying pressure. When you are taking the test, there are stakes involved: you are probably thinking about the score, accuracy, cut-offs and percentile. There are no such distractions once you are attempting the questions with a clearer mind (also, there is no fatigue as would be the case during the test; attempting quant after those 2 gruelling hours is an arduous task, no doubt) and that generally helps focus a bit better.The best thing you can do in this situation is to think of one question at a time and not the macro picture when you are attempting the test. If you tend to count the number of reds and greens when you are solving a question or are obsessively looking at the timer every 30 seconds or so, you would need to break this habit. The best candidates will invariably tell you that they are confident in their ability and that it is their attempt that will define the level of difficulty and not the other way around (in simpler words, if they are unable to attempt a question after a minute of struggle, they are smart enough to understand that more than 90% of the test-taking population won’t be able to solve it and so, skip it without any second thoughts). The key to doing justice to the test lies in being aggressive and fearless when you are solving every question.So, instead of worrying about your mock scores, use the mocks to get better at the actual test. Read the question carefully, solve it using the first method that comes to your mind (if you got nothing in 45 seconds, move on) and do not make any calculation errors. Repeat this 34 times and you should get a better outcome. Sounds arbitrary but it actually works in most cases when content is not an issue (which, I am assuming is true in your case considering that you are able to solve around 70 percent of the test).Hope that helps.","This is a very normal occurrence for quite a few students.It is very natural. This happens because your mind has already seen all the questions and whether you like it or not, the questions or the roadblocks or their concepts lurk in your mind and then when you solve it again, you seem to solve more.In a mock, you look at the questions for the first time and have to read them, absorb them, calculate, process it for the first time. This means that you need time to read, interpret, comprehend, understand and solve the problem.The way to move over this problem is to practice regularly and continuously. Give sectional tests and mocks frequently. This is because it will improve your retention, comprehension and solving speed and skills.If you ever feel that a particular topic and section is becoming tough and that you are repeatedly making mistakes in it, then the best option is to give sectional tests and practice beforehand wherein you read all the concepts, solve all the questions of all the levels of difficulty.For example, I always feel that geometry and P&C have always been my achilles heel. So, if I ever score low in quant or in LR, I double down from Arun Sharma books and the coaching reference books. This gives me confidence and allows me to go over the concepts once again. The surprising thing I have noticed is that many a times there have been cases where I forget few tips and tricks related to the concepts I have already brushed over. I usually then go beyond the trick, have a look at its reasoning and the method for the trick. For example, for finding remainder I always imagine doing it using the binomial theorem — this is because I can never imagine the other tips and tricks. For the mixtures portion, I always go by the LCM approach — this I do because I cannot visualise or calculate using the tricks. So, I know what works for me or what I am able to use.Never stick to one method just because it is easy —- being easy is a very subjective term.All the best!","When we come across with any friendly person, we feel very good. We would like to spend as much time with that person. Those individuals just make us feel extremely comfortable. But life is not a bed of roses. Many a times we have to confront individuals, perceived as not so friendly or may be deadly, whose thought processes are totally diametrically opposite ours. The process of interaction with such individuals, at times, can take an ugly shape of confrontation. We may tend to get so emotionally engrossed that the chances of getting almost intellectually paralyzed are very high. Brain just freezes. Mind goes numb. We may not be able to analyze the things objectively -as expected of a rational being. We just want to win our argument at any cost. And when that does not happen, our pride gets battered and bruised badly.But then, time is a great healer. We may have been pained by that individual/situation. But, over a period of time, we tend to forget that and we just move on with our regular daily set of activities. In fact, many a times, the converse happens. When we analyze those situations (when we are in cool frame of mind), the following thought processes tend to resonate.Oh ! I should not have done that.Oh ! How silly of me.Oh ! Why did i behave so inappropriately with that individual. It was just so ungentlemanly of me !Well, I think I should have behaved in a proper way.Essentially, many a times, when we try and recollect those incidents, we realize that was our own folly. But then, a price has already been paid. We may have lost that individual. But then, it’s life. We will come across with hundreds and thousands of individuals but with mindset different from ours.The fundamental questions are:->“Have we really learned enough from that first nasty confrontation so that the same can be avoided later on”. ?“Are we sure that we will be able to deal with those so called unfriendly individuals in a better way next time”?“Have we really learned from our mistakes “ ?“Can we maintain our cool and calm during pressure like scenarios”And that’s what CAT MOCKs are trying to teach us. The MOCKs are presenting to us lots of situations -some good, some nasty and some utterly disgusting. During the test time, sometimes we are not able to spot a friendly easy question. Instead we tend to spend a lot of time wrestling with a question which should have been ignored on the mere looks of it. But we tend to fight with that during the test time and if we were blessed with infinte time, most likely we would fight with that till eternity.In my last 14 years of coaching for CAT, I had interacted with thousands of CAT aspirants. It is very difficult to say what is a right formula to crack QUANT. What works for one person may not work for the other individual. Everyone is unique. There is no standard formula which can be applied everywhere.When we are writing MOCKs, there is that huge time pressure. We would have to learn as to how to handle that pressure. When we can maintain cool and calm, our ability to spot easy questions and do those correctly will multiply. Further, we will be effective in identifying torturous qs and ignore those quickly. But this brings forth another key point“If we were blessed with excellent time/pressure managment skills, can we do a large number of questions on the basis of those skills alone” ?Well, the answer is plain, simple NO.So, the question is what are those other skills which we should be endowed with and what we should do for that.There are some broad pointers/factors which we should be aware of.During the test time, don’t spend unnecessary amount of time on questions which are difficult. Such questions are meant to be left out. But, Yes !! During preparation stage, one should make a conscious attempt to learn relevant concepts and different techniques for cracking such questions.During the preparation stage, don’t leave out any chapter completely.There are around 25–26 chapters where the questions have been coming across in CAT for the past 10 years. For the sake of convenience, we can divide the entire CAT QUANT portion in two broad categories -1) FRIENDLY areas in QUANT 2) DEADLY areas in QUANTFollowing is a hypothetical scenario. Pls note that what appears “friendly” for one may be “deadly” for other.FRIENDLY Areas in QUANT (for a candidate X):->There are around 7–8 topics which a candidate X may feel comfortable with. Those topics are 1) Simple Equations 2) Ratio, Proportion, Variation 3) Percentages 4) Profit, Loss, Partnership 5) SICI 6) Averages, Mixtures and Alligations 7) Time & Work 8) Time & Distance. These topics are generally “perceived” to be less painful.There were 14–15 questions from the above mentioned areas in CAT 2017If anyone is out of touch with MATHS, the chances are very high that one will like to focus on ONLY the topics as mentioned above.DEADLY AREAS in QUANT(for that candidate X)There are other 15–16 chapters where that canddiate X may not feel comfortable with. These chapters may not appear as friendly as the ones mentioned earlier on. Qs from chapters like 1) Numbers -LCM, HCF, Remainders, etc 2) Geometry 3) Mensuration 4) Special Equations 5) Inequalities 6) Functions & Graphs 7) Coordinate Geometry 8) P&C 9) Probability 10) Indices & Surds 11) Logarithms 12) Trigonometry 13) Number Systems -Binary, Hexadecimal System 14) Quadratic Equations 15) Progressions 16) Statistics are very common place.Last year, there were around 19–20 qs from the above mentioned areas.It’s clear that the candidate X has less exposure. The chances are high that he will spend more time on qs which are from his friendly domain. But the number of qs from such areas will be limited in the exam-may be 15. As a consequence, during the test time, the number of attempts will get restricted to less than 15.And later on we realize that we could have done about 22 qs.Why does that feeling occur.Because, when we are doing that analysis, we are doing in a cool frame of mind. All deadly qs (during the test time) have started appearing friendly (during the analysis time).Let me present to you one example. This question is actually related to “Permutation & Combination”. Sometimes, the very mention of this topic can unsettle even a seasoned professional.Here goes the question.(Difficulty level of the question posed below is left for you to decide for)There are 13 players. Each player plays exactly one match with every other player. Find the total number of matches held.Ans:->When we apply P&C, we can get the answer by applying 13C2. Now, when we are not comfortable with the chapter, we may feel like leaving that question during then exam. But there is other way to look at this question -PATTERN METHOD.Take the following cases.:A, B (Matches held —-> AB)3 Persons:-> A, B, C(Matches held)AB, AC (2)BC (1)Total:-> 1+24 Persons:-> A, B, C, D(Matches held)AB, AC, AD (3)BC, BD (2)CD (1)Total: 1+2 +3 =65 Persons:-> A, B, C, D , E(Matches held)AB, AC, AD, AE (4)BC, BD, BE (3)CD, CE (2)DE(1)Total: 1+2 +3 +4=10Observing the pattern, we can say that the number of matches heldMatches = 1+2+3 +4……+12 = 78Let’s understand the bigger picture. During the exam, there will be easy qs-like the one above (Matches qs) (from so called difficult chapters).So, how do we spot those. During the preparation phase, we have to solve a large number of qs from various chapters so that we are not taken by surprise. Practice and a never say die attitude matters.We need to keep our mind open. Let’s enter the exam hall with our mind clear of any prejudices. If we can do that, CAT should not be a difficult one to crack.You can follow the link below for additional pointers related to CAT QUANT preparation.Rajesh Kumar Saraf's answer to What are some of the important tricks used for solving the quants section in the CAT exam?All the best !!"
CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,"There are fifty days to go for the CAT 2017, and I am barely scoring in the 60th percentile. I have analyzed and tried everything with 15 mocks down and the hopelessness is creeping in. How do I crack the CAT 2017?",https://www.quora.com//There-are-fifty-days-to-go-for-the-CAT-2017-and-I-am-barely-scoring-in-the-60th-percentile-I-have-analyzed-and-tried-everything-with-15-mocks-down-and-the-hopelessness-is-creeping-in-How-do-I-crack-the-CAT-2017,"CAT Preparation 2017, CAT (Common Admission Test) 2017, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation",8,"Firstly let the pressure not bring you down to hopelessness and just follow the strategic mantra of cracking the CATAfter each and every mock, make sure you are analyzing the mock on the same day.This will help you remember your thought process that went wrong during solving the problems.Verbal: RCs need thorough practice. Read Read and Read.For jumbled sentences, the easiest way to do is to identify the links between the sentences. Form two such linkages and it would be easier to connect the remaining.When you are solving the mocks, adopt this strategy so that it becomes a habit. It also saves a lot of time. This way of solving the jumbled sentences definitely helped me.LRDI: Identify your strength, whether it is LR or DI.Start with that particular section as it will help you boost your morale and also you will score better as you are good at it.CAT also has questions which are a mix of LR and DI. Make sure your basics are strong.Identify why you made a mistake in that particular problem and practice it twice or thrice until you understand the concept.Quant:All formulae on point. Last year CAT had some questions which were a direct application of the formulae. You can’t afford to lose marks in such simple problems.All previous papers to be practiced as they will contain all the concepts.Write as many mocks as possible and solve each and every problem of the mock tests.Check out the CATKing website for CAT level mocks which will add value to your preparation.CAT Mocks - http://catking.in/get-started-ca...Most importantly, just relax…More the stress, greater the difficulty.All The Best :) :)","Just try and take up the analysis more logically. There are two main reasons for scoring low in Mocks :Low attemps - If you are not being able to attend atleast 15 questions per section (doesn't have to be like this, maybe 10–12 in DI and 20–22 in VA), then it is a problem. Try to go through the topics if QA attempts are low. Read and read more articles each day to up your speed if RC is slow. More times than not, attempts are not the issue. The next point is.Low accuracy - You are attempting 45–50 questions in the paper but you are making a lot of mistakes. This is something common in CAT, and there is a way to go about it :In VA, try and redo each RC and rethink your thought process, i.e. what you thought when you marked the answer. Once you understand it, try to go through the lines of the paragraph to rectify your understanding of it. Doing this time and again shall make you comprehend better.In DI LR, you can't do anything but choose wisely. Only a few good men are capable of doing most of the questions within the time frame and you don't have to be that. Just try and choose the easiest one first and move on accordingly. It will add up to your marks and if it goes well you shall be able to do 16–20 questions on a regular basis.In QA, its about understanding the topics you are missing out on and the type of questions you are not being able to do. Go through those topics and also try choose the ones you can do, faster.I hope the points help you. Just keep calm bro. Mocks are there to scare you. Be confident and things will be good.:)","First of all stop worrying, there are still 50 days left for the D-day.Few points that will help you to plan the next 50 days of your preparation betterIf you are non-working or have less work/study related pressure please make sure you take atleast 25–30 mocks in next 50 days(Little difficult or fetched but again going from 60 to 95+ will take efforts)Taking the mocks is just the first step, analyzing the mocks are more important. I believe for each mock one should atleast spend 3 hours to analyze it.Analyze which section requires the most effort based on your mock results. After identifying the section identify your weak areas in that section. Work upon those areas extensively based on what weightage they had in past few year cat or mocks. For Example- If time, speed and distance is your weak area in quant section and it is quite observable that TSD always appears in cat/mocks then you should focus on that topic dailyI believe these points will definitely help you in your preparation.Now a personal story to keep you motivated-I also started with 60ish something in mocks when I first started preparing for CAT 16. It went on for sometime before I actually started hitting the nail. Finally I managed to score 98+ in CAT 16. By the way I am repeating cat this year to get better (that's a different story all together) but yeah if you can aim it, you can achieve it.Hope it helps","CAT is not a rocket science you don't need to melt metals for cracking CAT .

CAT,Which online coaching for the CAT 2018 gives personal attention?,https://www.quora.com//Which-online-coaching-for-the-CAT-2018-gives-personal-attention,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",13,"Every 2nd coaching institute claims that they provide personal attention to students in CAT preparation but when student joins the journey is entirely different. In Delhi, Alchemist has been making difference in CAT preparation with best online tools. These tools let the students control the preparation:Class SchedulingAlchemist has created modular approach and to proper execution of same they have created Alchemist Scheduler, which helps the students book their class as per own availability. This also Alchemist adhering to their batch size of 25. With the technology neither the student nor Alchemist itself can increase the batch size.Performance Analysis ToolAlchemist has been utilizing the Online Analysis Tool called OnlineMocks which enables Alchemist as well as students keeping track of performance. Students can track where they have reached and where they are lacking or good at for CAT exam. This begins with a SWOT analysis, as knowing your weaknesses and strengths is very important.KnowDoubtThe most important, Alchemist uses an App called KnowDoubt, where the students can clear their doubts with other students and faculty. This has eradicated the use of WhatsApp groups which is used by various coaching institute that breaches student’s privacy as there gets shared with the whole batch.","Learn Quest.1. Professors-Anuj Kumar Sinha and Nikhil Goyal are perspicacious and know their subject very well.LRDI in CAT is not a cakewalk.Exposure to new questions, clearing the basics is a must for picking the right questions in exam.LQ does that right.2.Mode of conduct-Facebook being one of the developed platforms for discussions i was very comfortable learning through that.One can save posts, tag the professor when in doubt , share posts, etcAlso, the site will not crash when there is unprecedented load factor so I can even revise in the last week.PS : In November 2017, TIME , CL site crashed so revising Aimcats / Mocks was a Herculean task.3. Doubt clearance-One can approach them 24*7 with the doubts.Also, there is one added advantage- to post your doubts is the group so that anyone can answer.4.Personal attention-The Professor bothers to ask students in person- How is your preparation going?What challenges are you facing?Or look at your scores and without mincing words tell you that your style of studying is incorrect.This is awesome5. Constant Motivation-When Aimcats throws surprises at you, when your scores plummet , faith in yourself will keep you pushing.The peers and professors won't let you spiral down.I could add more points.But, the most important thing for me is what i learn.Everything else is just perks.And Learn Quest will never disappoint you.So overall i would suggest the future aspirants to join LQ for learning and TIME / CL/ IMS / Hitbullseye atleast 2 out of the 4 to practice what was learnt.","A lots of online courses available in market but here i am writing only one name that is Handa Ka Funda.

CAT,"How ethical is it that CAT trainers appear for the CAT exam year after year and score exceptionally high? Don't they realize that to improve their vanity quotient, they're influencing the scores of thousands of aspirants negatively?",https://www.quora.com//How-ethical-is-it-that-CAT-trainers-appear-for-the-CAT-exam-year-after-year-and-score-exceptionally-high-Dont-they-realize-that-to-improve-their-vanity-quotient-theyre-influencing-the-scores-of-thousands-of-1,"CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching",9,"The answer to this is actually two folds. There are actually two types of test takers among the CAT gurus that I have seen.Faculties and Teachers : Basically the faculties of different institutes who teach Quants or DILR or English, generally mark the answers for their respective sections and in one or two sections they don't mark any answer, but rather try and memorise the type of questions. This ensures that they don't clear sectional cut-offs for IIM calls. So it is not much of a problem.CAT fanatics or Enthusiasts : These group of people tend to attend CAT every year and maximize their score untill they get a perfect score and so on. They definitely get multiple IIM calls, but that doesn't effect the regular Candidates because they don't go for any of the interviews and given that the B-Schools already call atleast 10 times the seats available, the other students who get a call don't generally have to compete with such people.Morever, CAT, once you get hang of it, is something that can go along with you a long time. It is a puzzle waiting to be cracked and each year many of the CAT Enthusiasts seat for it, just to see whether they have bettered themselves in any way.So personally I don't mind CAT Gurus taking the exam and it also pushes us to compete on a much higher level. :)","I have taken 5 of the last 7 CATs and I run an institute, so I finally have a question on Quora that I am particularly well-suited to answer. I do not apply to any of the colleges, so I can sleep easy. I dont think I affect the chances of someone getting a call. If IIMA has 198 general category seats and wants to call 598 people for interviews, they will still be able to call the top 598 based on their scoring mechanism. The presence of some scores that have not applied to IIMA should not matter to them.In fact, if IIMA notices that a bunch of people who scored 99.xx did not even bother applying to their college, it might knock them back and push them into working harder. This might do the rest of the applicants a lot of good. :-)","It's simple for me.I don't apply to any college. Don't tick college names in the CAT form. So, not hurting anyone's chance for a call.So when I am not in the race, the shortlisting doesn't get affected by me.Giving the exam helps me be upbeat with the pattern and help students better the next year. It is a duty for me.It's like being a football coach who is there with the team alongside the ground. The coach ain't there to hit a goal :-)","Straight line answer to your question : It’s completely ethical of CAT trainers to appear in CAT examination year after year, because then they are doing justice to themselves, their profession and their thousands of students. How ? By keeping themselves updated with the paper pattern (Paper pattern doesn’t mean marking scheme instead the topic wise weightage, difficulty level, etc.) Why do they need to do this? So that they can tweak their teaching style accordingly to squeeze out the best next year!Next point : Percentile score of these trainers doesn’t impact your chances at a B-school majorly (unless, if you are on the edge of clearing OA or sectional cutoff for a college. Yes, they might have impacted that cutoff) because they don’t apply for seats at these colleges.P.S. : I am one of the aspirants :)"

You have more than one year for CAT 2019. The speed can be built as you have ample of time. Believe in yourself and start preparing.You can join any online or classroom course for preparation. Both are equally good in terms of content. You can choose any mode of learning from these two depending upon some factors like distance of the coaching institute from your place, speed of internet etc. Following are the pros and cons of online and offline course:Online courses:Flexible.24*7 access to the courses.No travel involved.Teaches self discipline.Very helpful for working professionals and undergraduates preparing for CAT.Lack of interaction with fellows.Preparation interrupts in case of technical problems.Classroom course:Guidance and mentorship is not a problem as students meet their mentor regularly..Physical study material.More access to class activities.Can interact with fellows.Involves time of traveling.Expensive.Less flexibility in class scheduling.You have around 14 months which are more than enough to prepare for CAT exam. You can peacefully complete the syllabus, practice questions, write mocks and revise the concepts in these months even if study slowly. The best way to prepare for CAT is going by the plan of action or a strategy of preparation. Before starting the preparation, make a study plan and follow it religiously till the exam.It is required to study 300–500 hours to score a decent percentile. Set some targets like:Syllabus completion including practice by May 2019Revision - June 2019 to July 2019Test series - August 2019 to October 2019Keep November 2019 for 3–4 mock tests and complete revision. This revision should include your notes and the important questions from mocks.To make your preparation strategy, you can take help of toppers’ interviews or you can take my inputs:Understand the Syllabus and Exam pattern:The duration of CAT exam is 3 hours(180 minutes). Number of questions is 100 for 300 marks.There will be 34 questions from Quantitative Ability (QA), 34 from Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), and 32 from Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR).There will be both Multiple Choice Questions and Numerical Answer Type Questions in the exam.Learn the Basic concepts:Everyone asks us to focus on basics but there is one question which always strikes our mind - Why are basics so important?Now think about building a house. If we had all four walls already measured out and put them together against each other. We could make other people think that our house was secure. But once that first strong wind comes, suddenly the house is blown down and nothing is left.What do we do now? Obviously we will try to rebuild the house. But still the house is secure until the strong wind comes.This whole scenario is much like a CAT aspirant who ignores basics and thinks he/she knows it all. They stay with one topic for a while and then they move on to another topic without learning the basics of the last topics.So now the question arises that what was wrong with the house? We measured the walls properly and built the house in the correct ratio but what should we have done with our house to make it actually secure? First of all it is essential to lay the foundations. Then we build the walls, we add the roof, then we paint it, furnish it, make the outside look good and then live in it.In the same way your CAT preparation must begin with the basics.Practice, Practice and Practice:Our mind becomes good at the things if we do them repeatedly. Practice a set of question after learning its basics. It will give you a better understanding of the topic. With practice you will gain, accuracy, speed and confidence. Here is a list of recommended books: Recommended and Best Books for CAT Exam Preparation.Revise periodically:Human mind has a tendency to forget things in some time. But the good part is that it remembers the things if it sees / hears the things again and again. So to keep the things in mind that you have studied, revise them periodically. Make sure that you revise everything at least 3 times before appearing in the exam.Write mock tests:After completing around 75% syllabus, start attempting full length tests. After completing a test, analyse it carefully. You will know your weak areas by doing this. Now you have to work more on these areas. Note down your mistakes in a separate notebook so that you do not repeat them again.Read, read and read to improve your English part:Reading books / novels / magazines of your choice will help you in performing better in VARC section. Spare at least 1 hour in reading books. It will build a good vocabulary and enhance grammar skills which will also be helpful in Group Discussion and Personal Interview at the time of college conversion. If you are wondering which books to read, go here: Recommended Books and Novels List that every MBA / CAT Aspirant Should Read.Hope I helped you. All the best !!","You have more than a year time and utilising it religiously will surely help you to crack CAT. Depending solely on books and self-practice wont help you in a productive way, hence relying on an online course will be largely useful.A YEAR PLAN:Everyday Tasks:Spend 30 minutes reading editorials every day from newspapers like The Hindu, Economist, Mint, etc. This will help you in polishing your skills in VA & RC.Novels help you a lot in honing your verbal ability. Read a novel for an hour before the bedtime. Start with fiction novels of your own interest genre or else you can prefer authors like Khaled Hosseini, Sidney Sheldon, Jeffrey Archer, etc.Make notes of the new words’ meanings, synonyms, and antonyms as well as idioms as you read the editorials and newspapers. Use apps to make notes; this will be beneficial as it will always be with you anytime and anywhere for a revision or reference.Polish your basic English Grammar skills. Refer “High School English Grammar and Composition by Wren and Martin.”SEPTEMBER 2018 – JANUARY 2019:Start preparing for Quant, DI & LR. Learn basic concepts, and practice basic questions.I would suggest enrolling in “Handa Ka Funda” online course to ace in all the sections with ease. Refer to the video tutorials for learning the basic concepts as you start picking new topics. The structured method of the course will help you cover all the topics gradually as well as help you learn tips and tricks with respect to them.The following timetable will help you complete all the video tutorials of ‘Handa Ka Funda’ within 2–3 months.Along with the learning through the course spend another 1 hour for practicing questions from books of TMH/Pearson publications with respect to each section.On weekends spend as much as time you can for all the sections including VA & RC. Take RC tests for an hour on weekends.FEBRUARY 2019 – APRIL 2019:Start taking sectional mocksMAY 2019 - SEPTEMBER 2019:Take two mocks per week and analyse them to identify your strengths and weaknesses.Strive for the best.Thanks for A2A Md Wasif Alamgir. Hope I helped I you.Good Luck!","Hello studentWhat comes out from your question is the fact that you are not into the habit of reading. You need to build efficiency in reading and all three sections will appear better than before.Read these topics from wikipedia/google:PhilosophyPsychologyArtsScienceLiteratureSociologyCultureEconomicsFictionWhile reading, make sure you keep a track of “What” are you reading. This is called central idea based reading. Also note down contextual meaning of words which trap you. Guess the meaning as per context and then check the real meaning from the dictionary.You can also read some non-fiction and motivation/career oriented novels to begin with - foreign authors. Build volume of reading through novels. You can also refer to daily newspaper editorials for reading points mentioned above.Reading improves your interpretation abilities. This is the first step to structuring information. Then, the methods that you learn, section wise and topic wise come to your help in getting to the correct answer.Hope the idea is clear!

CAT,How can I prepare for the CAT 2019?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-prepare-for-the-CAT-2019,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",13,"Well, it is a very commonly asked question by most aspirants. Before answering this question I would like to applaud you. Since, you have planned to write CAT in 2019 and start thinking and making plans right from now to crack it. Though 7-8 is an ideal time to prepare for CAT. But you have about 28 months from now, you can do it very very efficiently. You can be at the par level of some of the best CAT trainers in India. Yes no mocking, seriously you can be at par!Considering the fact that IIM can’t change the sections at which they test the students, you have to prepare for four sections. Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation (DI), Logical Reasoning (LR), Quantitative Aptitude (QA).Since you have 28 months of time from now, you can explore and learn plenty of it. Starting from VARC section, start learning 4 words from today daily upto 25 months. Yes you don’t need to learn more than 4 words. They are enough for the day. So total words you can learn in 25 months period is 25*30*4=3000 words!!! Taking the assumption of 30 days a month. Phew!!! They are more than enough to decode the tough RC’s, whatever level of it could be. Do 1 reading (article or editorial from newspaper, I would suggest to read The Hindu) a day. You will complete about 750 readings and these will cover various topics like Philosophy, History, Finance, Politics, Psychology, Science and Technology, History, Current affairs, International News, etc. This will help you to understand the main idea of the passage and you will also learn about the various writing styles of authors. This will act as the main factor in decoding RC’s. Also, apart from readings solve 1 RC a day. And the rest remains Verbal Ability. Paragraph Jumbles, Summary of the passage, Critical Reasoning, Odd sentence out, Fill in the blanks, Last line of the paragraph, Facts Inference and Judgement, Paragraph Completion etc are some frequent topics that are tested in recent years. You can solve plenty of questions and will have enough grip on them. This is all about the VARC section.2) DI-LRNow coming to DI-LR part, which is the toughest section in the paper and the test takers give up while solving the sets. The best way is to crack this section is to start practicing solve from level 1 or even level 0 questions. Make up your speed and solve with 100% accuracy. Caution: Don’t look at the previous CAT question in the start of your preparation if you are not good at it initially. Seriously you lose hope and give up and keep this in mind that scoring 50% of marks in this section will surely fetch you 99+ percentile or even 99.5+ Because questions are lengthy and bit tough it it difficult for the students to solve the all the questions in the given time frame. That is the main reason why low scores will fetch you higher percentile.2a) DISo in Data Interpretation mainly question on Tables, Column Graphs, Pie Charts, Bar Graphs, Frequency Graph, Line Charts, Venn Diagrams, Caselets and various combinations of these are asked. This section is calculation intensive and you have to work on mental calculation to increase your speed to give an edge over others. Learn Vedic Maths, Approximation techniques, Percentage calculation, Certain common fractions, Squares and Cubes of numbers to make your calculation faster. If you are slow in calculation then you will take up huge time to come at the final answer. So start focusing on calculations right from now and you will see that your speed will increase drastically. But you must have patience to arrive at the results.2b) LRIn Logical Reasoning, questions from Linear arrangements, Circular Arrangements, Arrangements based on Rankings, Games and Tournaments, Venn Diagrams, Cubes and Cuboids, Network Diagrams, Quantitative Reasoning mainly are asked. Other topics like Syllogism, Blood Relations, Binary Logic, Logic Connectives , Clocks and Calenders, Number and Alphabetic Series are also asked in other MBA exams but they are usually not asked in CAT. Though you should have a fair ideas of these topics too. You can solve 1 DI and 1 LR set a day and at later stage you can solve 2 sets from each topic in a day as well. They will be enough for you to come across at different models of the question.3) QANow coming to the final section that is Quantitative Aptitude. If you will look at any book you will see that this section has a vast syllabus. But it is not true, This section test you in mathematical topics that you have studied in class 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th. No Calculus, 3D geometry, Conic sections, Trigonometry in it, which makes this section easier if you compare it with JEE levelTopics from which the questions asked are Number Systems, Progressions, Algebra, Percentages, Profit and Loss, Time and Work, Ratio Proportion and Variations, Time and Work, Races, Inequalities, Logarithms, Quadratic Equations, Boats and Streams, Speed Time Distance, Mixtures and Alligations, Simple Interest and Compound Interest, Functions, Geometry and Mensuration, Permutations and Combinations, Probability and Set Theory. These are approximately 20 topics and you can definitely give an average of one month to each. Solve 10–15 questions a day, means you will be solving about 400 questions in a particular topic. That is a huge number and one can stop you in doing that. You will be the master if you are solving 400 questions from a particular topic. Divide 10 days each in solving question of Level 1,2,3 difficulty.All the plans that I have discussed till now will not take more than 90 minutes a day (30 minutes for each section) and most importantly without the load of any time pressure beacause you have plenty of days from today. And 90 minutes a day to prepare for the national level exam like CAT is quite manageable and you can work out without finding any excuses. I am sure enough if you will work accordingly you will get 99.5+ percentile. No ifs and buts in it.Now the question arises from where to prepare from?I would suggest you to start doing preparation from you own side and skim through all topics. After a year you can join any coaching institute in India. Classroom Program will be the best. All coaching institutes are almostsame when it comes to study material, the only difference comes in the quality of trainers. If any coaching pays a high salary then you can assume that trainers will be well experienced. And fees of all coaching institutes is more or less the same. you will not find the difference of more than 5k.First of all, you purchase Arun Sharma Books. It will help you in building the base. I am mentioning the complete name of book and publication for your reference here.How to Prepare for Quantitative Aptitude for the CAT by Arun Sharma, 7th edition, Mc Graw Hill Publications.How to Prepare for Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension for CAT by Arun Sharma Meenakshi Upadhyay, 7th edition, Mc Graw Hill PublicationsHow to Prepare for Logical Reasoning for CAT by Arun Sharma, 4th edition, Mc Graw Hill PublicationsHow to Prepare for Data Interpretation for CAT by Arun Sharma, 4th edition, Mc Graw Hill Publications.I hope I have answered it clearly and all the best for your preparation!!Cheers!!","Thank you for asking.Answer might be bit long but it will be helpful for you. So use smartphone feature name scrolling and keep reading :pSo CAT 2019 is after 14 month and you still have enough amount of time to prepare for it.First CAT is divided into three parts namely Verbal ability, Logical reasoning and Quantitative aptitude.So lets talk about how to prepare for CAT 19 each section wise.*Verbal Ability*1.Start reading newspaper not only with the point of reading or increasing your verbal marks but also with the aim of increasing your General knowledge power and current affairs. By reading news paper you are doing those two things together. But reading newspaper wont be sufficient as it does not contain any questions and you might understand something but there are chance you might miss out something that author wants to tell shile reading article. So apart from this,i would suggest you to solve RC..Solve RC not from books but from Online platform,as most of the exams are Online exams and there is huge difference when you give same exam with pen paper rather Online. So practice from online material. For that i would suggest you to join iquanta facebook group CAT Preparation - iQuanta where you will find atleast 5–6 RC daily posted by other aspirants and try to solve them. Apart from this there are website like rcprep or you can find RC100 pdf online. Start solving rc from there. As out of 34 questions,24 questions are of RC and 2–3 are of para summary which is also somewhere small RC. so i would suggest you to focus on RC the most.If you are good with parajumbles then would suggest you to do it else just skip it like i always do.*DI*This one is one of the stressful section for students fron last couple of years. Not only because it is tough but it also checks how quick your senses are and how you are in selecting the sets.There will be couple of sets,which even they know that it is close to impossible for student to complete in the speed base exam like CAT and if you trap yourself in such sets,you might end up with disaster.So the best thing to score in LR-DI is to practice more questions on daily basis so you understand which sets you shoukd leave and before attempting the sets what are the things you should look for.Here i would suggest you to join iquanta facebook groupCAT Preparation - iQuanta where you will find one event dedicated to LR-DI, where daily 3–4 sets are being posted with its solution. Try it on daily basis without time limit at this point and you will be good to go.*Quant*This section is one of the most scoring section for student and you too should try to get maximum mark in this section.Try to clear you basics about each topic before attempting mocks or sectional. would recommend you to Join which is India's largest online prepartion group for CAT. CAT Preparation - iQuanta with more than 2.7 lakh people in it. You will find 400–500 doubts on daily basis posted by fellow aspirants and other aspirants are trying to solve it with different approaches and thats where the peer learning starts and which is very helpful.Stay in that group for couple of month and try to solve the questions and once they start their batch for CAT-19 student in January,you can join them too.Best thing about this group and there course is that they provide several shortcuts with method and in speed base exams,Short cuts are very handy.If you just want to see some of their short cuts you can visit (website link),you will find several quant short cuts in faculty gyan section,i was actually amazed by those shortcuts as those were never taught to us in any other classes and thats the reason iquanta is having maximum number of 99%ilers in CAT. You can check it from CAT Preparation online - IQuantaIn case of any doubt regarding iquanta course you can get in touch with them on i hope it is helpful for you and best of luck for your prepration :)","If you have decided upon preparing for CAT 2019, then the first and theforemost thing is to understand the dynamics of this exam. It is a 3 hourscomputer based exam which is going to test your aptitude and language skillsand eventually will decide your future as to which B school you will pursueyour MBA from. If you really aspire to go into an elite Business School, thenmake up your mind that you need to score a very good percentile which is not acakewalk. Slogging for hours will not do the job. There has to be meticulousplanning and optimization of resources. There are three sections in this exam-Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VaRC), Data Interpretation andLogical Reasoning (DILR) and Quantitative Aptitude (QA).All the threesections require a different skill set and their preparation requires a differentstrategy.VARC checks upon the language skills of the candidate. The different modulesin this section are grammar, reading comprehension, critical reasoning, parajumbles and para completion and odd one out. But, if one considers the mostscoring module, then reading comprehension holds the most prominent position.From the last few years there have been 24 questions (5 passages) out of 34questions coming from this module. The best thing about it is that you don’tneed to have any prior knowledge. Simply one needs to understand the passagesand solve the questions based upon your understanding of the passage. Forsome, reading comes naturally as they have been reading novels andnewspapers since their childhood. So, they won’t face major problems in thismodule. But there are many who may struggle with comprehensions as they arenot in the habit of reading. So, the first step is to start reading a lot onscreen.Read novels, e-books, newspapers, articles to develop the habit of reading.Make a habit of reading The Hindu daily especially the editorial section. Also,start practicing passages from GMAT club. It is an extensive store house ofgood passages. All the passages are time based here, so it will help you inimproving your speed as well. Pick up good novels and when I am saying goodit means novels of prominent authors where you can find enriched language. Itwill help you to improve your grammar, to understand the structure of passagesand more importantly will improve your stamina of reading.DILR- This is the most dreaded section of all the three. Every year the level ofdifficulty has been constantly increasing and it has become a nightmare formany. But this section requires a different strategy to ace. For LogicalReasoning, you need to solve puzzles. Make a habit of solving sudoku on adaily basis. Start solving two to three sets daily. Data Interpretation involvescalculations. So, squares of numbers, their cubes and conversion of percentagesinto their equivalent fractions must be on your finger- tips. Pick up resources topractice and start solving them. Start from the basics and once you have gainedsome confidence, then try to move to the difficult sets. Solve previous years’DILR sets. They are a brilliant resource to build your understanding and clarityof this section. Full length mock tests and the sectional tests will also give you aplethora of good quality sets.QA- This section is the most scoring of all the three and perhaps require most ofyour energies and time to ace it. It has a proper syllabus and you need topractice each and every chapter. The major modules are- Geometry, Arithmetic,Algebra, Number System and Modern Math. It is basically the math that youhave studied till tenth standard. But having said that, the questions are not reallyeasy. For example when you studied geometry in your school, most of us wouldmug up the theorems and their proofs. But here one needs to apply thesetheorems in solving a problem. So, getting an exposure to diverse models and ahell lot of practice will go a long way. Keep in mind that Arithmetic andAlgebra are the two most important modules. So, focus a lot on these twomodules. If mathematics scares you and your basics are shaky, then start withNCERT books to get a feel of the topics and gradually move to harderproblems.Now, there is one important aspect in the preparation. Whether to join aclassroom program or self-study will be enough. In my case I had joinedclassroom program by Kitabee Education Services. I personally feel thatcoaching helps you to trespass the restrictive boundaries set by our minds. Agood coaching guides you during the entire duration of your preparation,motivates you to perform to your optimum and more importantly helps u indesigning strategies other than the knowledge it imparts. It actually streamlinesyour preparation. But, simply a coaching cannot guarantee you results. Youhave to go the extra mile. You need to put in your best efforts to get the desiredpercentile. Also, join a good mock test series.I hope my answer helped u. All the best for your preparation.","CAT 2019 will most probably be conducted in the month of November 2019, so there is plenty of time for you to master the concepts included in CAT exam syllabus. Ideally, a year is more than enough to crack this national level admission test. If you’re really passionate about pursuing a career in the field of management then you must be familiar with the rising competition level of this exam. Therefore, you must prepare for the exam whole-heatedly to crack it so that you can get admission in top management colleges in the country.Performance in the exam is one of the main components for the selection of candidates in IIMs and other management institutes. IIMs also consider the academic performance and work experience of the candidates apart from the CAT score. Let’s go through the exam pattern of the CAT 2019 to get a brief insight into the structure of the whole exam-Exam mode: Online (computer based test)Duration: 3 hours (1 hour for each section)Total number of sections: There are a total of 3 sections in the CAT exam- Section-I: Verbal ability and reading comprehension, Section-II: Data interpretation and logical reasoning, Section-III: Quantitative ability.Type of Questions: Objective type (MCQ based)Marking Scheme: 1 mark will be awarded for right answerNegative Marking: 0.33 marks will be deducted for wrong answerThe registration process for CAT 2019 will begin tentatively from the 2nd week of August 2019. Students should finish 80% of the syllabus by that time. Now let’s figure out the key to score good marks in the exam. Here are some useful preparation tips for CAT 2019 that will certainly help you fetching good marks in the admission test-Don’t neglect your graduation: If you’re in the final year of your graduation, then the first thing you need to keep in mind is to focus on maintaining good academic performance. College students most of time ignore this fact and dedicate all their energy in preparing for CAT which affect their overall performance of the graduation. Now this doesn’t mean that you don’t have to prepare for the CAT, you can prepare for the common admission test provided that you maintain good academic record.Don’t only focus on IIMs: It is commonly perceived notion that getting a good percentile in CAT will get you admission in top IIMs in the country which is partially true. You need to look beyond the IIM as there are other good B-schools that offer the same quality of education that the IIMs offer. Candidates focus solely on IIM and when they don’t get the result they’ve expected they go into depression. Therefore, prepare for the exam with a positive attitude that you have to give your best no matter what the cutoff will be. You must however prepare as per the level of IIM then only you can be sure of your performance.CAT is not only about the scores: There is a misconception among the candidates that scoring good marks in the CAT exam will set their life for good. The fact is that CAT score is just one of the many parameters used by the B-Schools to shortlist the candidates for interview process. You must not think about the scores while preparing for the exam otherwise this will impact your performance. Simply put your best foot forward and jump straight to the topics giving no regards to the scores whatsoever.The key to success is practice: Practicing the mock test/test series on a regular basis is the only way to ensure success in the exam. A lot of students initially join a test series but as the time goes by they lose their study momentum and deviate from their schedule. This is the reason why some students clear the exam in their first attempt whereas some fail to clear even after giving multiple attempts.Current Affairs and joining the dots: To improve you English and reading comprehension, you must develop a habit of reading an English newspaper. Getting in touch with the current events affecting the world, business, and nation lets you form an opinion on the subject. This certainly helps you a lot in the interview. You should find the way to connect the dots leading to an event to get a clear picture. You may also watch English TV series/movies to improve your English Vocabulary.Use reliable books for CAT preparation: There are tons of CAT preparation books available in the market that can confuse the students. In such a case, students should only go for the books that give them the correct and reliable information. Here are some of the leading reference books which are famous among the aspirants for CAT preparation-Verbal ability and reading comprehension by Arun Sharma and Meenakshi UpadhayaWord power made easy by Norman LewisHigh school grammar by Wren and MartinData interpretation by Arun SharmaLogical reasoning and DI for CAT by Pearson publicationsQuantitative aptitude for CAT by Arun SharmaStudy materials by TIME, Career Launcher, and IMS.Shoot the depression: The preparation for CAT exam can be quite exhausting to some aspirants. But they don’t need to consider the exam as a situation of life and death. They should always bear in mind that it’s just another exam in life that you will take. The most important thing is that you learn from these experiences. So instead of losing hope you should stay positive and motivate yourself by reading the experiences of the previous year toppers who have faced the similar struggle when they were preparing for the CAT.Stay positive and never lose hope!All the Best!"

Important CAT Preparation Tips!As bells start ringing for the approaching CAT exam, all the students want to know How to crack CAT in 2 months? Moreover, with the new pattern of CAT exam, strategies will need to change. The ideal approach to score high in MBA entrance exams is true to the age old saying of “Work hard for what you want because it won’t come to you without a fight.”To bell the CAT, you need to know its nature. There is still no clarification on the proposed changes in CAT pattern.There will be 34, 32, 34 questions respectively in Quantitative aptitude (QA), Data interpretation and logical reasoning (DILR), Verbal and reading comprehension (VRC). Apart from multiple choice questions, there will even be non MCQs.There could be more data interpretation questions or more quant ones. In the second section the questions ratio of verbal ability and reading comprehension against logical reasoning may also change. As there is no official word on this, we have to be prepared for any pattern.The new preparation strategy for CATA lot will be decided by the CAT practice test hosted by IIMs at CAT 2018. Despite taking n number of mock tests by coaching institutes, the final word will be said by this official CAT mock test. We will need to wait a little longer for this to be available though.In our opinion, in the last two months you need to focus on two things – (1) Topic wise revision, (2) Mock tests.It goes without saying that if you have not already started revising, it is high time to do so. Give in more hours in a day, know your strengths and weaknesses, and just give it all.Be prepared for anything and everything!The uncertainty of pattern is wreaking havoc among CAT aspirants. But look at it this way, you are all in the same boat. So rather than preparing based on pattern, prepare for topics. There could be an imbalance in number of questions being divided among sections. But as long as you are equally good in all, it will not make a difference.Divide your time among the two major sections and four sub sections wisely. If you are exceptionally good in one, give it a little lesser time and try to improve the areas you are not so good at. You do not want to lose precious marks in any section!Go back to the basicsThe USP of CAT or any MBA entrance exam is that it does not involve rocket science. The topics are of basic mathematics and aptitude. Aim of any management entrance exam is to test a candidate’s aptitude and problem solving ability. As long as you know the fundamentals like the back of your hand, there is no looking back.Preparing for basic English questions in CAT – To justly increase number of questions and to let students solve them in lesser time, there could be a rise in questions on basic English. This could include more speech, tenses, word formations, phrasal verbs.Logical reasoning – On any given day, LR questions take up more time in a paper. Racing against time, you need to solve LR questions tactically. Remember, incorrect answers will give you a negative score. Practice more questions on seating arrangements, relations, sets, premise and conclusion. Focus on improving your speed and accuracy.Quantitative Ability – Remainder theorem, geometry, number system, PC, probability; these are your friends for life. Or at least for CAT. As a large number of engineering students appear for the CAT exam, it is expected that this section is the most scoring. Like basic english, questions of quant are also expected to be more.Data Interpretation – Learn to visually understand data. Graphs, pie charts, bar diagrams are all information rich data being presented as graphs. Graphs are meant to make things easier to understand. You will need to understand this fact before moving ahead with these questions. DI section is scoring for those who have the knack of breaking down visual data into information.Speed and accuracy – That is all you need to get the perfect score in CAT!Solve questions quickly, and correctly.Rather than trying to learn concepts, you can start doing questions from the beginning.Do not spend a long time in just knowing a concept. Start practicing its approach in questions.Two months before appearing for CAT exam, you must know which are your weak and strong areas.If you are yet unable to understand the weak topics, do not spend a very long time on them.Start further strengthening your strong areas. Try to solve those questions in lesser time.",As per the eligiblity criteria .Yes you can appear for CAT 2018 .

CAT,How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-did-99+-percentilers-prepare-for-CAT,"Prepathon, Exam and Test Results, Common Admission Test Percentiles, Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",100+,"My authority on the subject? I scored a 99.75 percentile in CAT, 99.55 in XAT, 99.45 in SNAP. This is a walkthrough of my preparation/ how you can go about preparing for CAT and other entrance exams.CAT is considered to be one of the most difficult entrance exams in India, but it is isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most of the topics that are tested in CAT are High school level topics. The difficulty lies in the fear of the test. Most CAT aspirants resign to an assumption that they can’t score above a certain percentile without even knowing what the test is made off, half the game is lost at this point.I have been guilty of the same myself. Jan 2016, I remember looking at lists of MBA colleges and immediately rejecting the top 30 odd colleges for the fact that they all required you to score above 97 percentile or so to realistically make into those colleges. It was only when I talked to my father and he explained to me the negativity in my thinking, that I realised, I hadn’t even seen what CAT consisted of. I had no logic in leaving out the possibility of scoring an extremely high percentile.Another reason why I felt that I had to score an extremely high percentile were my 12th class marks. MBA colleges give weightage to academic profile. A self-analysis made me realise that having a low score in my 12th class (69%) was a huge handicap. If I had got a low percentile I would’ve found it extremely difficult to make into the colleges of the relevant level. I would’ve ended up in colleges ranked even lower. I had to score a 99+ percentile. BELIEVE you can Crack the CATHow to go about:I have divided the preparation for CAT into four parts:Pre-preparation, Preparation, Practice, Taking the CATPre-PreparationThere are a few things you’ll want to have in place before you start your preparation for CAT and other exams.Find three hours a day (not in bits and pieces here and there) three continuous hours to prepare. This can be extremely difficult if you are working/ attending college. This might help you to find a few extra hours a day.Get rid of any distractions that you believe affect your concentration or mental state in general. (social media is one of the biggest time-suck and tends to distract you even if you aren’t online)Get in touch with someone who has cracked the entrance exam or has some expertise in the same, you could approach a local coaching centre. (you may not enrol as a full-time student but you would want to be in touch with the faculty there by buying their material or tests etc.) This will be helpful in getting certain finner tips and in case you have difficulties.Get yourself a campaign manager. Cracking the CAT and getting an admission into an MBA college is a long drawn process. You are bound to lose interest or forget important things/ deadlines. Get someone who will keep track of the same. For me, it was my father who helped me keep track of my preparation and all the college applications. Make sure the person you chose exactly understands the process and understands what you want. They will make sure that you are still going even when the motivation starts to run out.Read a lot. This is extremely important when it comes to the verbal ability section of CAT. You will need a lot of broad-based readings and an ability to make sense of what you have read quickly. The passages for reading comprehension in CAT are sometimes extremely abstract and can be extremely difficult to make sense if you aren’t used to reading a lot. Places where you should want to read from: Medium, The guardian, Businessweek Bloomberg, Also read some classic novels that you can lay your hands on, the books talked about on crash course literature are a good place to start.PreparationCAT is divided into 3 sections verbal ability reading comprehension, logical reasoning data interpretation, and quantitative ability. Each of the sections requires equal effort and attention.Time for preparation: There are many people and sites who will tell you that you need 14 hours a day to prepare for CAT. Trust me that doesn’t work. You just need 3 to 4 hours a day consistently over a period of 3- 4 months to crack CAT. Anything more than 5 hours a day can and will burn you out.Source material for preparation: A common mistake that most aspirants will make is relying on just one book/ one source for preparation (particularly anyone who takes coaching). It is recommended that you have access to at least some material from different authors. This will provide you with multiple points of view for the same problems. (same goes for mock tests recommended that take at least 4 to 5 tests from A differen source).Verbal Ability & Reading ComprehensionThis is one of the most frustrating sections in CAT. The question often can seem to have multiple solutions and where options are provided all of them seem correct. Even if you are extremely good with English you can end up messing this section.The key to cracking this section (particularly Verbal ability part) is understanding that this section is more about logic than language. You have to understand the logic as to how the solutions are arrived at (jumbled para is the killer in this section).I initially worked this section by looking at the solutions, that way I was able to see what patterns to look out for and what logic to apply.Work on improving your ability to comprehend complex /long sentences, particularly from topics that you aren’t used to and having complex vocabulary.This section will take a lot of practice to master, more practice than the other two sections. This section has the highest returns for scores. If you get a slightly higher score in this section your percentile can increase drastically. (I scored a 99.98 percentile in this section).Even if you have a good command over the language DO NOT take this section lightly, I know of aspirants who have the CAT along with me having excellent command over the language yet messing up this section completely.Data interpretation and logical reasoningData interpretation is a practice intensive section. There is nothing new that you have to learn in this section. It is just the ability to carry out basic calculations using tools you already have (percentages, averages, summation, division). Practice these basic tools thoroughly so that you are extremely comfortable with them. Also get acquainted with all the various forms of data presentation, such as graphs, pie charts, tables, caselets etc.Logical reasoning is a section which you should and can make the most out of it. The questions are very often similar. While practising logical reasoning the things you would want to learn is gauging the difficulty of the question quickly. If a question is difficult, move on to the next one (time is important).You would want to practice visualising the problem (in mind / on paper ) in the simplest way possible. This will help you breakdown huge paragraphs full of seemingly meaningless words into sensible data.Learn to have an unbiased mind. One of the mistakes you can make in this section is assume somehting that isnt true. Learn to use all the information provided and only than make any conclusion.Read the data carefully a single word can change the whole situation. (for ex. XYZ is not wearing a black pant. can easily be mistaken for XYZ wearing a pant if you miss out on the not.)Quantitative abilityThis is one of the more easier sections to get by, You just have to understand the concepts behind all the topics involved. Again the topics in this section are high school level math. You can over prepare for this section and most aspirants do.There are certain topics in this section that you would want to be extremely thorough with since they appear most frequently (going by the trends of past so many years), such as time speed distance, time work, Geometry, Functions.You would want to also be thorough with averages alligations, percentages ratios since these topics are more helpful in DI section but very rarely make an appearance as stand-alone questions in QA section.Number systems personally I felt for me was an extremely overrated topic ( I spent way more time than required here)PracticeTaking mock tests, I feel mock tests will be the most important part of your preparation as they help you guage exactly where you stand. (another benefit is to know which colleges you should apply to).What is a good number of mock tests to take? There isn’t any concensus on this topic, there are CAT toppers who got by on hardly any mock tests, and than there are people like me who took close 40 mock tests.Personally mock tests where the biggest source of practice for me. I took mock tests from 3 different sources. ( I recommend atleast 2 different sources). Once you have taken a mock test it’s extremely important that you analyse them well, I spent about an hour and half after every mock test to analyse where I have gone wrong and what can be changed. Mock tests are also a good time to test out strategies in handling various sections. (I will try to come with a detailed post about analysing mock tests.)I will boast a little here, but thanks to the trends on my mock tests I was extremely confident of getting the percentile I got on CAT. ( I expected at least a 99.5 %le)I recommend practicing during the time slot you will actually be answering the CAT, I had to take the CAT on a sunday in the morning slot (9.30 to 12.30) at a centre 30 kms away from home. Considering the reporting time of an extra hour, I would have to technically leave my house at 7 in the morning on the day of the test. I usually get hungry within 2 and half hours of eating anything. So in the month before CAT I trained my body, by having breakfast at 6 in the morning and not having anything till 1pm. I also trained myself to sit at one place for 4 hours (830 to 1230). This may seem funny/ unnecessary but on the day of the test you dont want to have any other factors troubling you.Taking the CATTry to stop preparation for CAT at least 3 days before CAT (there are people who will disagree and reccommend you remain in the mood and keep preparing) anything you try to “prepare” during these last days often will be of very little help. Don’t wander away from the CAT mood though, read or at least make sure you are sitting 3 hours at a place for these last few days ( to stay in the CAT mood).Do not take a mock test in the few days before CAT, If you mess the mock it is likely that you will panic on the day of the CAT.Do not keep any expectations as to the number of questions you want to complete in each section.All the best for your preparation for CAT.P.S. CAT isn’t everything, CAT is hardly a learning experience, you won’t learn anything new as such (well other than how to prepare hard) it’s mostly about things you already know, taking the CAT can hence be a very frustrating experience. I recommend that you learn something else too on the side lines, get a hobby or hold a job (again debatable as to how much time you can find etc.) If you are taking drop read a lot, read all the books you can get your hands on. All in all try to do something else too that will help you grow.Belling the CAT and other entrance exams","This answer is fairly long, about 7000 words. So I have divided my answer into 9 parts wherein each part can be read independently. However reading the entire answer in one go will serve as RC practice, so that would be advisable.What I have mentioned below helped me in my journey from 66% -> 99.85% in CAT. I have tried my level best to be as detailed as possible. GK as a section is not there in CAT as of now but is very important in the other papers like XAT, IIFT, SNAP, etc. So, I have included that as well. I have also put in a little bit about how to attempt mocks and then analyse them to improve further. A little bit on GD-PI-WAT as well, so that this answer serves all your needs.I would like to point out that I have been an average student all my life and am a GEM (General Engineer Male), yes pun intended. My 10/12/B.Tech scores are 83/79/66. With that I made it to IIM Calcutta, so the first thing that you should now do is stop worrying about your previous grades. 99% of the people reading this will surely have better grades.

You could try hitbullseye. If you have already enrolled for a test series or for a classroom programme, then attempt one of their mocks. Many of you would be like bhai abhi toh padhai start bhi nahi ki, mock deke kya hoga aur upar se aadhe questions toh samajh bhi nahi aayenge aur maths ke formula bhi yaad nahi hain. Additionally while attempting the mock, there will be multiple instances when you will feel like getting up because you are not used to solving questions for 3 hours at a stretch. Your brain will also try to deceive you into grabbing your smart phone for checking Whatsapp. You will feel like drinking water, you will also be tempted to check FB. The point of this test is to make sure that all this doesn’t happen when you actually attempt CAT. Now you would be thinking what is the point in attempting a mock when I don’t know $hi+.Precisely my point! The main reason for this mock was to identify what you know, what you don’t, where you stand and how much hard work is required.Once you are done with the mock, check the solutions and find the topics which you already know, which you attempted correctly. Some problems would have been there which you would have been sure of but you got them wrong because you were out of touch and forgot the formula or recalled an incorrect formula. You probably forgot the plural of fish. Fish or fishes? Or does it depend on whether I am talking about a species of fish or multiple units of the same species? Then you will realise that a little brush up of a few topics (which you are out of touch with) will dramatically improve your score. Work on these topics first and then move on to topics which you have no clue about. This mock decides your future course of study.Now, on to the preparation phase.B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityStart off with this site. http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/Click on start and then check your score. You know where you stand. Keep practising a few times every day and your score will keep improving. If you can hit 50-55 consistently in the default 120 seconds, you will easily hit 99.5% in CAT in this section. If you are targeting 99.5+ then I would also like you to memorise the following:B1.) Reciprocals, Squares and Cubes up till 30. Pay attention here, some values will get repeated. As for 1/7. Remember that it is .142857. For other go up to 2-3 decimals,whatever you are comfortable with. I would prefer 3 decimals though.B2.) Power of 2 up till 12Power of 3 up till 8Power of 4 up till 6Power of 5-6 up till 5Power of 7-10 up till 4Power of 11-13 up till 3Again same as above. Some values will be the same. 4^6 has already been covered till 2^12 and so on. Don’t just mug up blindly, pay attention to the numbers.B3.) Square Root up till 10B4.) Factorial up till 10B1-B4: Now most of you would be like, dude they give an inbuilt calculator. But then other exams don’t have that calculator. Additionally who do you think will take lesser time in solving a question? A person who uses the calculator for finding 12^3 or someone who just knows it is 1728. Believe me when I say that this is very important for your LRDI section as well. This will decide whether you get stuck at 99.5% or go beyond that. This is the deciding factor. Please memorise these values.B5.) A few important numbers like 999=27*37, 1001=7*11*13, 21^3=9261.B6.) Some numbers have the property wherein the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the no itself. 1, 2, 145 and 40585. Please remember these.B7.) There are 15 primes till 50, 25 till 100, 46 till 200 and 168 till 1000.B8.) How to find the sum of the first n natural nos. Sum of squares of n natural nos. Sum of cubes, sum of 4th powers. Please remember the formulas. Specially the last one (fourth power), most people forget that.B9.) Scale is not allowed in any of the exams. What the CAT authorities mean is that the scale which we used back in school that is not allowed. They never said anything about using your hand as a scale. Check the length of your fingers. Also check the length of the 3 sub division on your fingers. Use your right or left hand, whatever suits you. Please make sure that you remember these values by heart. These values will help you solve 90% of the geometry questions. Also, buy a protractor and make sure you can make the angles 30, 45, 60, 90 properly. First with the protractor and then without it. Based on the question, make a rough figure. Then based on your lengths, find the answer and then scale up to the value given in the question. Geometry has a lot of formulas, memorize them or use this approach. Approximation ftw!B.10.) Unitary Method. Make sure you are good with this, half the QA syllabus can be solved using unitary method. Do you think whatever has been mentioned in B9 is basically Unitary Method at the end for getting the answer?Most of the students go for solving the maximum no of problems. Don’t do that. Focus on the basics, don't go for solving questions directly like most students. Most students don’t score 99+. You are different, work differently. This is how you should be doing it for any given chapter day wise. First day go after the formulas and try to understand why a certain formula is there. Make sure that you have memorised all the formulas for that chapter. If you were to set the paper, what could be a possible question? Read a formula, try to frame questions on that formula and then memorize the formula. Just memorizing all formulas in one go won't help, because you will probably forget. If you can do this, then you would have solved all the questions by the time you finish reading the theory.Example: Let's say you are studying Numbers. You see the formulas for HCF and LCM of 2 nos. Then you see the factors of a number. Now think of possible questions on this. Let's say 72.1.) How many odd factors are there?2.) How many even factors are there?3.) What is the sum of the odd factors?4.) What is the sum of the even factors?5.) What is the product of the odd factors?6.) What is the product of the even factors?7.) How many factors are squares of natural numbers?8.) How many factors are cubes of natural numbers?Good going, you just completed half the chapter! Similarly think of more questions that you can make. The exercise at the end is filled with such questions. It depends on your thinking. Focus on this. If basics are fine,questions won't be a problem.Would you memorize 456*876 and 235*9865 and things like that or learn how multiplication works?If you think that you lack imagination when it comes to maths and can’t do the above, then no problem. As mentioned above, by the end of the first day you would be done with memorising all the formulas. That’s it. Don’t solve anything. Just make sure all the formulas are deeply rooted in your brain and you can recall them anytime you want. Now take a break for a day. On the 3rd day, start solving problems. But remember that you are to solve by recalling the formula not by turning over the pages and looking at the formula. If you cannot recall, then please make sure you memorize the formulas again. Solve a few problems. Take a day’s break and continue solving on the 5th and similarly on the 7th day as well. This way apart from the formula getting imprinted in your brain multiple times, you will also understand which formulas are asked more often than others. Some chapters are connected to one another. Make groups of such chapters. If working on a group, try to complete all the topics in that group. For example:Ratio Proportion, Unitary Method, Percentage, Profit and Loss.Simple equations, Simultaneous equations, Inequalities, Time speed distance and work, Quadratic.Progression.Numbers, Bases, Miscellaneous equations.Surds and Indices, Logarithms.Mensuration.Geometry.Coordinate Geometry.Probability and PnC.Functions and Graphs.For people trying to clear the cut off in this section. The first 3 with mensuration and a bit of geometry/numbers will be enough.C.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningData Interpretation is speed and practise. The site mentioned in the Quant region and B1-B4 there would be of immense help. These will increase your speed. Generally each and every DI set has at least a problem on percentage or ratio.Today when you start, start off with the sole intention of solving all the questions of a given set. When you can do that on a daily basis. Move to 2 sets a day. When you can do that. Move to 3 sets daily and then to 4 sets. Keep solving as many questions as you can. Time taken per question will decrease with practise. A few months after you were born, you started to crawl, then you started walking and finally you started running. Same thing here. Don’t think about speed now. Speed comes gradually. Let nature take its course.Logical Reasoning, as the name suggests is based on how well you can interpret and analyse things. LR checks your thought process, it checks how you tackle problems. Get this book ""Puzzles"" by George J. Summers. When you watch a football match, why do you watch it? Probably because you want your team to win or you want to see a good contest and enjoy. Similarly, once you have bought this book, think about your objective. It’s not about getting the correct solution, it’s about improving your thought process. And additionally the puzzles in this book are tough. You could think of it as the daddy of Irodov. Engineers will get the joke! You won’t be able to solve most of the problems and frankly speaking I don’t expect you to. However, what I do expect from you is to read a question. Try to understand what has been given. Try to understand what is being asked. Think about it for say 10-15 minutes. Write down whatever approach you can think of. If you could not solve it, look at the hints and their solution scheme. Were you thinking in the right direction?Analyse the difference between the method given in the book and your method.Try to understand what you missed because of which you could not solve the puzzle. Try again for 30 minutes. If you can solve it, good enough, if not maybe try again. After a few more tries look at the solution. Remember you bought the book to improve your thought process, not to solve each question in the first attempt. Trying a puzzle for 5 minutes and then looking at the solution will take you nowhere. Solving again and again till the time you get the answer is what the book was bought for. To make sure that you can think and get the answer on your own. The answer at the end is just for verification. 1-2 puzzles a day. 3 at max, not more than that. You have to improve your thought process,not complete the book as fast as possible. Your scores in the LR section will improve in a month’s time and then it will stay at 99%.Another very important point would be to memorize the alphabet-number conversion table. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. You will come across questions on this in your mocks as well as in the exams.D.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI had 69 and 72 in English in 10 and 12 respectively. My verbal score in CAT went up from 43 -> 87%. Whatever I have written below is what I did to make sure that I cleared the verbal cut off comfortably. If you are looking at a 99+verbal score, then you would be better off by reading the other answers to this question for improving your verbal section. This part is not for you kindly move on to the LRDI section. If you however $uck at English just like me, then this just might help you in clearing the sectional cut off. I tried memorizing words from the GRE word list. My language skills were not good enough to use words like persiflage, perspicuous, ubiquitous, scintillating, etc. in sentences. So, I would keep memorizing and then keep forgetting these words. I had never read novels so I had never come across such words as well. So, I came to the conclusion that memorising words won’t help me. But, a decent vocabulary is needed for CAT. So, I bought this book “Word Power Made Easy” by Normal Lewis. Managed to complete the chapters in a few months. I didn’t do the word list at the end. I would request you to buy this book and complete the chapters.Another thing that seemed obvious to me was that whether you look at RCs or Para Jumbles or Para Completion or Para Summary. All these have basically been written by some person who had a very good command over the English language. So all these things should logically have a flow of thought with which the author would have written the entire thing. You just have to understand that flow. If you can understand an RC, then understanding a paragraph from that RC will obviously be very easy for you. Think about it, a PJ or a PC or a PS are basically paragraphs taken from an RC. You just have to understand the flow in which the entire thing was written by some person who had a decent understanding of the English language. But, then I again had a problem. The Verbal section in CAT was supposed to be of 1 hour and as soon as I would start reading an RC, 8-10 minutes down the line I would feel drowsy. I would start thinking about checking FB or Whatsapp or practically doing anything apart from reading that stupid RC. All those Speed reading techniques, skimming, reading the question first and all. None of that mattered. I understood what my problem was. COMPREHENSION and CONCENTRATION. By the time I was in the 2nd para I would have forgotten what was written in the 1st para. It’s called a READING COMPREHENSION for a reason. Never trade comprehension for speed.How to improve comprehension and concentration?Both will improve gradually with time. First step is to make sure that you don’t feel drowsy when reading for an hour. You will be required to do that in the exam. So you need to build your stamina to concentrate. Start off by reading 2-3k word long articles on News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian. Register on the website and you will get a mail every morning at 10am. Read all the articles from there. Make sure you read at a stretch for an hour. Read everything from Culture to Technology to Art to Literature. In the beginning you will feel sleepy within a few minutes of starting. Slowly you will gain rhythm. Within 15 days you will be able to read 1 hour at a stretch. In a month’s time you will start retaining information as well. Then focus on just 1 category every day. Like only Philosophy or only Art or only culture. With that your stamina and concentration will increase further and since you are reading about only 1 thing for 1 hour, your knowledge in that topic will also increase. This can be done at home, but preferably in office to better utilize your time. PJ PC PS are all extensions of an RC. All will seem easy once you are comfortable with RCs. Here News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian you will be reading 2000-3000 word long articles. Once you are used to this, 500-600 word passages in CAT and other exams will be a piece of cake for you!For verbal, always eliminate choices and then mark rather than directly trying to find the correct answer. This section is different from the other sections,so it has to be dealt in a different manner. Please eliminate choices and then answer. If in doubt, leave. As for the grammar section, I have no idea when to use have and when to use has. Same with is/are and things like that. Neither can I spot grammatical errors in sentences. So, I mostly leave such questions.But I always read them. You can always answer a few of them based on instinct. Some sitters are always there in every paper.E.) GK -> General KnowledgeAll the papers except CAT have this section. Some have a sectional cut off,some don’t. This section can be answered in about 5 minutes. It has the highest marks/min for any section. This section is the key to a high percentile. This section will give you the points for speaking in a GD and PI and also for writing in WAT. So, if you plan on getting through to a good B-School don’t ignore it. There would be 2 methods to prepare for this.E1.) Start reading any newspaper. Go through the headlines and all. Make sure you are updated with what is happening in the country. After a week or so, you will realise that it’s mostly the same thing that keeps getting repeated everyday in the paper. Think of it from the point of view of the exam. There will be MCQs. So they won’t ask for your opinion on Kejriwal vs Modi. Leave all the pages on politics. That’s sheer wastage of time. Don’t waste time on that stuff! Make sure you remember the schemes which Mr Modi keeps rolling out. At least remember the important ones. Did any big firm buy another one? Any Indian who won some award abroad. Who won which Grand Slam? Who won the Pulitzer Prize? Who won the Arjuna Khel Ratna Award? India is working on the Chabahar port with which country? Malcom Turnbull is from which country? I think you would have understood what is expected from you. MBA is about business. Focus on economic and business news more than others. Noble Prize in economics fort his year? How many Deputy Governors are there in the Reserve Bank? Make a doc file with these details. You file would look somewhat like this.https://docs.google.com/document...This is what I had made for this year, so no this won’t help you! You will have to make one with the current affairs of this year. Since you will be working the entire year making this, so by the time the exams are a week away, you will have such a file. You might however think that this is too much work. In that case I would suggest you try the second and relatively easier method compared to this.E2.) Whichever is the first exam for you which will have a GK section, keep 4 days before that exam for making this file and memorizing it. Gather all the monthly booklets which are given to Time students. Each book has about 100 questions. Memorize the ones you think are important. CL and Time both will also have a few sheets on GK, current affairs, etc. Get those as well. CL GK compendium. Hitbullseye gk pdfs are also there. You can get most of these online for free or search on Pagalguy, someone would have uploaded it there for sure. Whatever you think is important, please memorize that. 4 days is more than enough to complete all the material I have mentioned above. By going through the monthly magazines you will also be able to keep track of what is happening in India and also round the globe.The regular reading (The first method, reading daily) means that when the exam sare about to start, you would have completed most of the things. The last 4 days will serve as a revision for you. I did both the above things. So if you have time go for it. A close friend of mine, Prateek, he was preparing for UPSC. He was of immense help! Whenever I would meet him, we would talk about how things going on in our country. Served as revision for him and I would stay updated with facts. So, if you can find someone who is preparing for UPSC religiously,i t would be great. You will also have a contact who is an IAS officer. If you want to score even higher in GK get a small yearbook from some shop. Small ones general contain 100 odd pages, going through that will serve as revision as well.F.) How to attempt mocks (Non-CAT exams at the end)The first step here is to make sure that you can sit and concentrate properly for 3 hours at a stretch. FB, Whatsapp, drowsiness, drinking water or the sudden urge to go to the washroom during these 3 hours have to be removed.Kindly take care of such things which might disturb you, especially the last 2 and then start a mock. When you are attempting the mock, the only thing in your mind should be about maximising your score! Another point that you should keep in mind in that no one cares about what you know and what you don’t. The only thing that matters is your score. So please keep your ego aside when attempting the paper. Yeh question kaise nahi bana, kal hi toh banaya tha and then you spend the next 15 mins on it and still end up marking the wrong answer. Please don’t! You have a fight with your girlfriend and then you are like “I am not texting her first”. Yes I was talking about that very ego of yours, please get rid of it when you are attempting a mock. If you can’t solve a question then please move on to the next one. The examination hall is not the place to derive a formula and then solve the concerned problem. Anyways, I could go on but I think I have made my point.Remember that half the paper is very easy, mostly formula based. Your approach should be to attempt these questions first. Make sure that you have touched the 97-98% mark and then move on to the difficult questions for improving your score.F1.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityYou are not supposed to start from question no 1 and then continue till 34. Most of the times you will not even be able to look at some of the problems in the end. So we will follow a Round by round approach. About 50% of the problems are direct formula based. When you start this section (Round 1), keep the above point in mind. So, as soon as you look at a question. Can you solve it in a minute by using a formula? If the question with a formula was given to a 5th grader, would he be able to solve it. If yes, then solve this question. Use the values given in the question, get the answer and then move on to the next question. If you see a question and you are like, yaar yeh toh banaya hua hai, 2-3 min lagega, lamba question hai. Or if you are like sirf cases likhne hain, phir count kar lunga, phir answer. Such questions which you know you can solve but are not direct formula based, are to be left out now. These have to be attempted in the 2nd round. Getting my point? If formula based, then attempt else next. Within 30 minutes you should have attempted about 16-17 questions and you would have seen all the questions. That will get you at least 97-98% in this section.Now Round 2, there were a few questions which you had seen earlier and were pretty confident about. This is where your brain will help you. The human mind is so awesome that even though you just looked at it once but solved different questions and totally forgot about it, you brain was working on that question subconsciously without you having any idea about it. Now, when you read the question, you will take a lesser amount of time to solve it compared to what you would have taken had you solved it in the first round itself. You could go for Round 3 as well, your choice! But 2 rounds are needed. Please stop with a single round method which most of you are used to now.Why this approach?Many people are most often not able to see the entire paper,so they miss sitters. This round by round technique helps you go through the entire paper and thereby select the easiest ones which in turn maximises your score. You won’t get a prize if you solve a question that only 10 students out of 2 lac could solve. The marks per question is the same. Since you solve the easier problems first, the chances of your committing mistakes goes down considerably. A question which you have solved but incorrectly is not wasted time and only a -1 for your score. Instead of 3 you get a -1. So such a question effectively hits you with lost time and a -4. This method reduces the no of such questions. Hence, this approach.F2.) DILR -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningIf you have tried solving the book which I had mentioned above, you would by now have a fair idea about how to make a table for solving LR problems. 5 people, 5 countries, 5 cars, 5 pets. All of us have solved such puzzles,haven’t we? You would obviously have 4 columns but which would be the first and which would be the second, etc. That determines how fast you will be able to solve the set. Oh, you thought it didn’t make a difference? It does! Sometimes you are better off soling set theory problems by a table. This is where your practise and experience comes into play. Making the proper table means half the work is done then and there. You just have to put in the values and tick mark the correct answers now.Now about how to attempt. When you start the section, go through the 4 LR sets.1-2 sets will be very easy. Take a couple of minutes and try to identify the easier ones. Look at the questions. Do you see any question wherein it asks how many cases are possible or questions of that sort? Such sets are to be solved at the end. Look for sets wherein directly by looking at the questions, you know that there is one unique solution. Use the answer options to further reduce your time for soling that set. Now start with such sets. First advantage of this method will be that you will feel good, because you will be done with a couple of sets in 10-12 minutes. Additionally you will be in a flow and your chances of cracking a difficult set will go up. Now compare this to the case when you start the section, and think that looking at all the questions means losing a few minutes. I am James Bond, so I will start with the first set. 10 minutes later you haven’t completed a single question and now for the remaining 50 minutes you will keep thinking, yaar 10 min faaltu mein barbaad ho gaye. Good luck solving that section and the next with such a mind-set.Many a time it will happen that the set you picked up, is going nowhere and yet time is passing on. For such sets, wherein you have already spent 4-5 minutes but haven’t been able to mark even a single question. Please leave that set.You might be tempted to think sirf 2 min aur, aur phir 4 questions ban jayenge. Please don’t commit that mistake. 5 minutes is the threshold in which you should have been able to mark at least 2 questions. Worst case scenario 1. If you are at 0. Please move on. You are better off solving that set later on,preferably at home!Same with DI sets, go through the sets, select the easier ones, and complete them. You will be left off with 2 sets. Again with 2 options, it always easy to select the easier one. This way most of the times, you will end up solving the toughest set at the end or you will probably leave it. All questions have the same marks, so isn’t it better to solve easier ones? Additionally tougher problems will also take a toll on your brain, your effectiveness for the next section might go down. Do you want that to happen?Sometimes a set will be easy but a question in there will be extremely tough.Beware of such questions, these are put in place to derail your momentum. 5-7 minutes per set is what you should be looking at. Always look at the questions and attempt. You don’t have to attempt all questions from a set. Even 3 attempts for a set is fine. Again, you know the term that I am talking about!Keep that aside when attempting a mock.F3.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI get tired of reading and lose interest quickly. So RCs at the end seems a bad idea. So, I start off with RCs. Again as soon as you start this section. Glance through all the RCs in a minute and check if any of them is from a subject you like. Your reading speed and comprehension will be higher in this case. Again as mentioned above, just because you read an RC, doesn’t mean you have to attempt all the questions. Even 4 out of 6 questions from an RC is good enough. Just attempting for the sake of increasing attempts is sheer stupidity. Please don’t think ki aree yaar itne marks toh already aa hi rahe hain exam mein. Dusron ko thoda mauka de deta hun -2 leke. Please don’t do that. Eliminate options and then attempt. When in doubt leave. Move on to the single questions after the RCs.Note -> For non-CAT mocks which you attempt online.First and foremost thing is that apart from CAT, most are pen paper based, but at home you attempt online papers for these. Take a few print outs of the OMR sheet and check how many minutes you need for marking the answers. Keep a 5 min buffer for your safety. Let’s say we talk about IIFT. It’s a 2 hour paper in real. However I need 20 minutes just for marking the bubbles. So, there is absolutely no point in attempting the online paper at home for 2 hrs. Submit the test after 100 minutes. Don’t worry if people attempt for 2 hours and your rank is low. Your score in the main exam matters, not in this one. Similarly for SNAP and XAT as well. Form a basic strategy of how you would like to attempt the paper for the 100 minutes(whatever your time is after you have checked marking in the OMR sheet). Like for Snap, I had a strategy of 5-6 minutes for gk then 16-18 minutes for verbal, then 35-40 minutes for LR. Then maths and as soon as it would be 90 minutes after the start, I would mark all the answers. Then solve and again mark in the last 5 minutes. Similarly make your strategy for IIFT, SNAP, XAT, etc. and stick to it.G.) How to analyse mock?The instant you submit a mock, you will have a score in mind, itna toh banta hai. 1 sec later the page reloads and you see your score and you go, are yaar itne toh 2 section milake hi aa jane chahiye the. This is why analysing the mock is important. You knew a certain score was achievable but your score went down drastically because of silly mistakes. Analysing mocks will take care of such mistakes. Once the solutions and result for a mock are out. First of all check up all the problems which you couldn’t solve. That’s what you have to learn.Then look at the time taken by the topper in solving a question. Look at your time. Did you take 200 seconds whereas the topper took 30 seconds? That’s because there is a technique you don’t about. Learn that technique. Write it in your notebook where you write formulas. That was about identifying and learning things which the toppers know. You have to be one of them. Go through the mocks and find such methods. AdditionallyThen there will be a category of questions you were sure of but you somehow used your talent and got it wrong and after looking at the solution you are like aree yaar yeh koi kaise galat kar sakta hai. But as a matter of fact, you did! This will happen mostly in counting problems (Numbers). Even if you had 100 in English in 10 and 12 you will still come to know that you had been using some Grammar rule incorrectly or there is some exception you had no clue about. But, after a -4 you will remember them! You will sometimes come to know that a certain word which you have been using all your life can also be used in a totally different context. Thank You without an exclamation mark? Sarcasm! Oxymoron, alliteration, etc. Learn what these mean. Such mistakes will make sure you remember all these. Sometimes you will take the diameter as the radius and solve. Sometimes 2*3 will become 5 and sometimes 7*19 will become 114. Don’t rush through problems. The paper is set so as to give you enough time. Slow and steady wins the race.Then another section in the results shows the % of people who attempted a question and % of people who got it right. You are supposed to attempt the easy ones first, then the average difficulty questions. Finally attempt a few difficult ones or totally leave them out. Here you can check which questions you were supposed to attempt but didn’t. Also the questions which you were supposed to leave but being the Bond that you are, you nonetheless decided to attempt it thereby losing marks and giving others a chance to overtake you. If your family is worth billions of dollars, you could do that, but given that you are still reading this, I doubt it! So whenever you look at such questions, try to think about what was in your mind during the mock which made you do such a thing. Try not to commit the same mistake again.Yes, I agree all this will take more than 3 hours. Who told you getting into a good B-school was easy?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?The study material from the top 3 institutes namely Time, CL and IMS is mostly the same. I have seen and used it, so use whichever you want, it won’t make a big difference. A few new ones like Hitbullseye and test funda are also coming up. Haven’t used the material by these 2 so can’t comment. In terms of content the level of questions is higher in Time. I mean tougher questions here, so you are better prepared for CAT, but then you could also argue about why put in more effort than required. In CL, the theory and explanations for quant is way better that that in others. Theory for quant is literally non-existent in Time. IMS is good for verbal. As mentioned above, please use that book for LR and also that book for Verbal. I have not mentioned the names of the books, because if you scroll up and check you will then remember the name when you have to tell it to the shopkeeper! That LR book will help make a strong base for you and then completing the LR material from these institutes will give you practise and improve your skills further. For those who keep talking about Arun Sharma, please please please use proper material. Do you really think 1 book is good enough for your CAT preparation and others are stupid who go through all that? If you think you are smart enough and don’t need all that and 1 book is enough. Good Luck with CAT!Mocks basically tell you where you stand when compared to the toppers in the country. Time has the most no of people attempting its Aimcats. So having that is a must. Next in line, with the maximum no of people attempting the mocks would be CL. After that you have IMS, test funda and all. Aimcats are pretty tough when compared to actual CAT but are extremely important because it gives you a true picture of where you stand and how much more effort you need to put in. CL mocks are close to the CAT level especially in terms of quant. IMS mocks are close to CAT level in verbal. I would suggest Time + CL/IMS. You can however take all the 3 if you want. Or maybe some other institute’s mock series. It’s mostly about practise.The mock questions are mostly the same. It’s just the values that they keep changing every year. Same with the material. Whether you look at the material of this year or that of 5 years ago, you will realise that it’s mostly the same. So, you are better off buying old material from someone or from a secondhand book store. I have uploaded some mocks and some prep material. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...https://drive.google.com/open?id...I also found some useful material from total gadha. Here’s the link for thathttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...I.) GD-PI-WAT prepFrankly speaking, getting a score is easy. This is the tougher part. This requires more hard work because in here, you will be up against the best in the country. Most of the people attending the interviews will come prepared, so here your odds will be higher. So, please work hard for this. GDPI prep as such should be dealt with in a different question. So, won’t go into the details here, but just an over view of what is expected of you. If you had done the GK and current affairs part as mentioned above, you will be easily able to manage the WAT. You will also have ample of points for speaking in a GD. Similarly questions on current affairs in a PI will also be a piece of cake for you. What remains is the HR part. In here, you have to understand that you can guide the interview and you can force them to ask exactly what you have prepared. But that requires a little thinking. Tell me about yourself is a standard question which is used to initiate an interview. It is mostly followed by your strengths and weaknesses. The main thing here is that you have to try to make a story and link everything that you have done in your life till now with why you want to do an MBA. The interviewers are smart people, they have been doing this for years. They are extremely good at catching liars. So think this through well. This part of your prep needs your utmost dedication and hard work. Prepare your answers properly. It is really tough to explain how to prepare for GD-PI. You will be better off at some institute where someone can guide you individually. However, what I can still do is upload all the GDPI material that I have and share it with you. But do keep one thing in mind, this contains some files on the current affairs of 2015, so that will be of no use for you. The other stuff is pretty much relevant. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...I hope you convert your dream college. May the force be with you!","How ‘NOT’ To prepare for CAT/GMATOne of the most important strategy in CAT/GMAT is to find out the wrong choices to identify the right one. This post is dedicated to “Avoiding Mistakes” strategy.Myth & Mistake-1: Following the Herd. Choosing a help or any coaching because others are choosing itHumans belongs to Animal kingdom. If you have studied Biology, then this point will be easier to understand. In animal kingdom. Weak animals are always in herd but the strong one is solitary or always having small groups. Ever wondered Why??The answer lies in the mentality. A strong animal judges the situation and leads its life based on its experience but a weak animal actions are based upon others. If others are doing it, then it’s wise to do it. You can choose to be a Herd follower or to make your own paths.Never follow the group. A leader never follows. If you will move with a group, you will always be with them. If you will create your paths, then only you can beat others. Adding following lines from Robert Frost to add a dramatic touch:“Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”Myth & Mistake-2: Focusing on absolute number of Successful Candidates rather than Percentage.Most of the Institutes talks about the number of success stories but are silent on how many of their students were unsuccessful. Even their Advertisements talks about total number of students getting Interview call or final admits. But the real numbers are shocking, most of the Institutes have 2-3 % students getting expected result.But the magic is in numbers. Make people follow a Herd and even if 2-3% students are successful, the success numbers become substantial. The problem is that your chances of landing in the unsuccessful students group is 98%, but this data does not bother them because they know how to work upon the “Herd Mentality” of the population. Show them 2% success stories and make them follow a herd.Myth & Mistake-3: The Bigger the Better.I am referring to Class Strength. No teacher can teach a herd. If your batch size is more than 10-12 students, then you are not getting proper attention from a teacher. If the education company is claiming “Customized or Personalized” services, then the class size must be less than 10-12 students.Myth & Mistake-4: Going after a Brand or No.1 education companyAll Branded books are easily available in the market at very low-cost. A student joins any help or coaching to get a personalized teaching experience. A Teacher-Student relation is analogous to a Mother-Child relation. There is nothing called “No. 1 Mother”. Every mother is No. 1 for her Kids and the reason is her personalized attention.Rather than sitting in a large group with “No. 1”, you should aim for a personalized attention (We join any help for their teachers or their course offering).Myth & Mistake-5: Deciding after taking DemosAll Institutes stage their Demos. They are very carefully planned. The teacher is usually the teacher, who will not teach regularly. If anyone says “Book your demo” or guide you to a specific time, then it is staged. The best way is to ask them about their class timings and insist on sitting in the ongoing class. If you feel the focus is on you, then you are at the wrong place.Try to identify honest institutes. Honesty should be a very important deciding factor.Myth & Mistake-6: Choosing Institute which makes “Toppers” or just focuses on “Past Records”Never choose any institute if its marketing is focused on this fundamental. Keep your basics simple. Think what you want from it and focus on its delivery. You are there for education, not to hear its past stories.Institutes focus on this factor to take your attention away from their product. Your focus should only be on their product, their teachers, their teaching methodologies, their course structures, etc.Myth & Mistake-7: Jo Dikhta hai, Wo (Nahi) Bikta haiA good product needs no marketing. Weak products need marketing. Whenever you see lots of marketing effort, Google ads, ATL or BTL, it proves that the product is weak. Strong product does not need for all these advertisements. In the marketing world, out of 4Ps, the product is supreme. Focus on “Product”.Myth & Mistake-8: Marketing Gimmick-CAT/GMAT Toppers as TeachersThis is the most commonly used marketing tool, which has a flawed assumption. Now I am talking more of “Critical Reasoning” language. The flawed assumption is “All Toppers are good Teachers”. Teaching needs a very different skill set. The teaching is to impart knowledge; all toppers cannot be good teachers and all good teachers cannot be toppers.Myth & Mistake-9: Institutes offering Patented Techniques or “Tips & Tricks”All tests require “Hard Work”. If someone can patent “Hard-work”, then this “Gimmick” should be accepted. “Tips & Tricks” are developed with your hard-work. Shortcuts should be evolved and should never be learnt from someone else. Particularly for CAT/GMAT, which is more of an IQ test, “Techniques, Tips & Tricks” should be evolved.Myth & Mistake-10: CAT/GMAT will take me to HarvardThis point is more applicable to business schools taking GMAT as a screening tool.The student’s full profile will work. The CAT/GMAT is a one small part of the profile. Look at all business schools as a family, no family will allow you to be their part till the time they see their values or virtues in you. Every Business school has a distinct positioning and your profile should be positioned in the same way. Profile building is the main work and every person should concentrate on.Myth & Mistake-11: Adopting Toppers StrategiesHear everyone, but adopt none. Every person develops his own ways depending upon his Strengths & Weaknesses or as per his conditions. Good for someone may not be good for you. Hear everyone, but adopt only wisely.Myth & Mistake-12: Practice-More the merrierPractice Better, Not More. The practice should have a direction, running in circles will not help. Do Tests and review. Keep error Logs and keep on practicing. Practice wisely, so that every time you move, you should learn from your past mistakes. Do not overdo the tests.Myth & Mistake-13: Teachers will make me a TopperTeachers show us directions. Unless you practice the topics taught in the class, it will not work. I saw many students thinking that if they spend more time in classes, it will help.Myth & Mistake-14: All tests just needs lot of studying, no need to focus on healthHealthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. I see many students not focusing on their health during exams. Many of the studious people have unhealthy bodies. You need to balance life with at least 7-8 hours’ sleep.Myth & Mistake-15: I do not need any peer groupYou learn more from peers than the teachers. The most important factor will be jealousy. Competition in the group brings the best out of you. I was very fortunate that all others in my group were good. They have already scored more than 700 in prep tests. Every test was like a world war where every one of us wanted to beat everyone else in the group.Myth & Mistake-16: I will study and practice from lot of free materials on netBeware of free materials. There is no free lunch. Some free materials are good, but most of it is crap. The real test is different from the Free tests you see on the net. You will be caught off-guard if you are preparing from the net material.Myth & Mistake-17: Beware from 30-day toppers, 15-day toppersThis is the most common way of advertisement. Become a topper in 30 days or 15 days. It’s hilarious. This is a perfect example of fraud marketing. The CAT/GMAT is an IQ test. Only Asterix magic potion can do it and nothing else.Myth & Mistake-18: You can deceive GMAT Computer Adaptive AlgorithmPlease do not try. GMAC has evolved a test which cannot be deceived. Every question can carry you “Up” and throw you “Down”. Each question is important and has the same value as others do.One more myth is when a student believes that difficult questions carry more marks. And easy questions weightage is low. Do not read too much into any strategy. Work hard and it will show.One more mistake is trying to gauge your performance by counting correct questions out of total. This is the reason why the GMAC computer algorithm is difficult to copy.If you see easy questions, you are not doomed. It does not necessarily mean that your test is not going well.Myth & Mistake-19: Quantitative is important, Engineers have an advantageEngineers do not have any advantage in this test. Rather, they are at a disadvantage because their strength (Quant.) does not have substantial weightage. I have seen many students crossing 700 with 40 in quant and Q40 can be achieved by more than 80% of the test givers.Myth & Mistake-20: I am good in English, verbal will be kids playVerbal is not English, verbal is all about IQ. The only portion of the grammar it touches is SC. But the way CAT/GMAT tests your grammar is more based on IQ rather than grammar rules. SC is more about identifying the wrong choices rather than the correct one. It depends upon how easily you can see 2-3 splits and apply logic to find the correct answer.In CAT/GMAT, there is no perfect answer, you must mark the “Most” correct answer. There might not be any perfect answer in the five choices.Your choices should be based on your experience and how a help will help you cover your shortcomings. I found EduShastra customized approach much better than others. I also found their teachers dedicated to their students.","I'll tell you step by step how you should study to get 99.9 percentile in CAT,now you have around say 11 months to prepare. so CAT exam typically comprises of1.

CAT,CAT or GMAT which one is tougher?,https://www.quora.com//CAT-or-GMAT-which-one-is-tougher,"Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",56,"Do you have domestic plans or international plans?Do you carry actual work experience?Can you spare your time for T.I.M.E?How do I score 750+ on GMAT?Ans: GMAT is super easy. You can take the GMAT exam max 5 times in 1 year. You can take each exam after every 16 days as per GMAC's new policy. I know it does take $250 (~Rs.16000) for each exam you take. Just remember that this exam is gonna decide your career and a very high GMAT score will fetch you a guaranteed 30%-50% scholarship as an international student. Top B-schools can track your record of each attempt you made to pick up the best score you earned. I'd suggest not more than 3 scored attempts and the score remains volatile for 3 years. Try to get at least 3 years of work experience (actually speaking, you need 5 years of Work Ex to become a very strong contender) and since you've got a lot of time, why not prepare from Day 1 instead? This is how a normal guy would think right? However, to prepare and crack a super competitive exam like GMAT there is no need for a tuition class and you don't need to prepare heavily for 3-5 years for this exam.You just need to subscribe for an online course (gmat.magoosh.com or gmatprepnow.com)and try to solve 40-50 Questions everyday for a period of 75 days for Math and Verbal lessons with 109 secs on stopwatch for each Qsn. Try 50 Qsns x 100 Secs = 5000 secs everyday's mental pressure i.e. 90 mins of mental football everyday for the next 75 days w/o half-time.Analyze your score.Improvize on the weak areas. It will take a month's time to refresh your Math and Verbal skills via tutorials.Plus, you do not want to waste and wait for 1 year for the CAT exam.GMAT is accepted in most B-Schools in India (even IIM-A/B/C/.......but only for top 1%-2% candidates).If you are currently pursuing your Bachelors degree i.e. if you are in 2nd or 3rd or 4th year engg., you must take a look at ISB's YLP program. Talk to the AdComs i.e. Admissions Committee for the median cut-off for undergrads. A score of 700 on GMAT would do the trick in Stage2.IIM-A/B/C median GMAT score is 750+ (but the FPM doctoral program has 680+ ->  48Q and 39V minimum for FPM admission i.e. >87th %ile).If you are an Indian, you must have at least 4 years of work ex and 730+ on GMAT for IIM-Bangalore (check this coz the competition here is too stiff).Go for EPGP and save your 1 year (-: It is a 720 hrs intensive program as against 960 hrs of its flagship PGP program.If you are an offshore candidate and did your MS abroad (>= 18 months program), you can send your GMAT score of 710+ for IIM-Bangalore (as of 2015) for 2 years PGP program (very good for networking).XLRI's median GMAT score is 680-690 i.e. >85th %ile.No shortcuts to XAT for BM via GMAT.If you have 2+ years of Work Ex, wait for 1 more year and aim for Global MBA  orIf you have 4+ years of Work ex, wait for 1 more year and go for GMP.Be ready with your GMAT score by 15th December for XLRI.ISB Hyderabad GMAT median score is 700+ i.e. >89th %ile.It is a 700 hrs intensive 1 year PGP program.Again, minimum 2 years of Work ex would suffice for ISB.(people generally have 4-5 yrs of work ex here.....So, if you have just 2-3 yrs of work ex, you need to earn a very high score on GMAT for sure).For ISB, be ready with your GMAT score by 15th October for Round1 or 15th Jan for Round2.If you are from Mumbai:SP Jain (650+)SJMSOM - IIT Bombay (700+)NMIMS (600+)Welinkar (600+).....All accept GMAT and will fetch you â‚¹.100k/month package for sure (-:but IIM Bangalore's package would be â‚¹.200k/month. So, rethink again!!!The beauty of GMAT is that you can mentally prepare yourself with 1 month's preparation and crack the exam with 700+ score. I'm talking about 150,000+  out of 1.29 million people cracking the 700+ score (equivalent to 89th percentile score) in the past 5 years:http://magoosh.com/gmat/2014/wha...Now, imagine if you want to crack the score of 700+ and hope for an admit to top 10 universities in USA, you'll have to go beyond 710-720 score to get a Wharton/MIT/Stanford/Yale call .....depends upon your MBA aspirations. Yes if you have a vast amount of Work ex, you can score low on GMAT i.e. 680-720.Remember, I said that it is much easier to study with your own pace and crack the GMAT in 2 months time and get a 750 score....every student competes with nearly 5000 applications in a university (Top15 B-schools) for getting an admission according to the specialization.....again depends.CAT needs 5-6 months of preparation (but you have to wait for 1 whole year for this exam) and if you aspire to have an IIM tag on your belt just to show the world that you are the Man, you can choose to give your CAT, get mentally set for the 99th percentile score and in the meantime you can easily give GMAT a try for 1 or 2 attempts :)Likewise, GMAT is awesome. Verbal has SC-CR-RC with 13-14/14-15/19-22 marks respectively. So, anyone who scores 13-14-19 on Verbal SC-CR-RC, will be on a high scorer bracket. Quant goes with 40% DS and 60% PS i.e. 15 and 22 Qsns approx. respectively. Math has no Graphs/Calendar/patterns logic/hard Functions....no Calculus and DI(except for 12 IR Qsns). It's purely logical.GMAT can be cracked with your own pace. CAT needs a lot of time. A lot of patience!GMAT Verbal will kill you for sure. But it gets more interesting when you try to solve a couple of hundred Qsns from each section :)There are 8 x 3 topics for Quant, SC and CR.See the pic below:â€‹So, there are around 30 topics in total that you need to master in 100 days right?For Quant, OG content + Magoosh + Manhattan is enough.If you are really really weak on the Verbal part, start with the foundations -Nautical Miles by IMSorWord Power Made Easy by Norman&LewisorManhattan MGMAT Foundations of Verbal book.You have tons of Apps in the App Store for pocket prep.Try these:Official GMAT app by gWhiz (in-built Timer + Reset button),Prep4 GMAT app by MIT guys (a very comprehensive app),Veritas Question Bank app (has 250 quiz qsns...50 for each),Complete GMAT Video Course app by Veritas prep,GMAT ToolKit 2 app for flash cards,Magoosh GMAT Math app, GMAT idioms app for flash cards,Pocket GMAT app by Manhattan for flashcards(For more flashcards, go to beatthegmat.com website),Pranayama app (for 5 mins mind yoga) andTimer+ app (stopwatch).The GMAT online forum community helps you a lot. Only 2 main active GMAT best forums in the market with over 10 years of expertise are gmatclub.com and beatthegmat.comDon't even think to go beyond that (-:So, log in and skim through the entire website rightaway.Become a silent observer of top main moderators (e.g. Bunuel and bb on gmatclub.com) and top members and followers on both the forums (-:Try to solve at least 10 mocks that are available for free for the 1st attempt (from Manhattan MGMAT, Veritas Prep, The Economist, Kaplan, 800score, Platinum GMAT, http://litesee.com/gmat.htm for verbal, Princeton Review, gmatclub.com and the actual GMATPrep s/w that includes 4 actual simulation tests of the GMAT exam ) and try to supplement it with an online course such as magoosh.com or gmatprepnow.com (hardly takes $99 for Magoosh and $0 for gmatprepnow).Buy the actual Quant Review and Verbal Review from GMAC.(buy it from amazon.in ;) save â‚¹300)Wiley, the publisher, provides you an online access to solve the same Qsns which allows you to simulate real GMAT exam mode online (-:Buy Question Pack1 from the mba.com (takes $30).Now, see the pic below:Total = around 3000 Qsns here.If you follow my chart shown below, you'll get your dream score for sure.Byheart this chart and solve these Qsns 2-3 times.Maintain your Error Log:GMAT Error Logs - Free Tools for your GMAT StudySo, say if you want to crack GMAT in 100 days, take out the entire column and divide it by 100 i.e. try to solve 6 DS 9 PS 5 SC 4 CR 1 RC passage per day. Try to go step by step. 1st complete Magoosh in 20-25 days and then touch the OG content and then touch your laptop with GMATPrep QsnPack1 practice. At this modest rate, you can easily cope up with 34-35 Qsns/day. Take rest on Sundays. This is really important. Don't budge. Complete the entire practice set and you'll feel confident enough to crack the mocks after 50 days for sure. Why 50 days? Remember, 3000+ Qsns are actually hidden in the mocks as well. So, double or triple your speed as per your capacity to digest that kind of data in your head. Keep that hunger and solve 20 mocks at least :)Don't forget to solve Manhattan MGMAT Qsns(I've not mentioned here in my chart) for SC and it really helps to crack the SC section if you could download ""Thursdays with Ron"" which is entirely for free (-:It has 50+ videos till date with more than 80+ hrs of online coaching content and get a high speed internet connection for downloading this 15 GB of awesome Verbal content or stream it as you wish:http://www.manhattanprep.com/gma... Do check this for consolidated files:http://gmatclub.com/forum/update...You don't need to go for an actual mentor coaching because the online part covers everything and the forums will help you solve your doubts quickly (-:These are 2 eBooks with 200 pgs of awesome content that you must read: SC Tips eBook from Prep4GMAT by MIT guys (-:SC eBook from Magoosh's blog for idioms (-:Even if you are not satisfied with your official CR content and are really hungry for more, go for Powerscore CR bible, Powerscore RC and the Official LSAT SuperPrep......You'll have to dedicate another 100 days to cover this entire topic (2000+ Qsns) if you are weak in CR or RC. Actually speaking, you need to really do the OG content and feel each CR Qsn thoroughly. For RC, you'll have to improve your english skills if you are a non-native. This means that you'll need to read NYT/The Economist/ The Hindu or play with fiction novels. You do realize that these great authors and highly paid writers have strong vocab skills embedded with years of practice and perfection....I am Marathi. I sucked at verbal with 30-34 initially. And I have read 570+ novels and 10,000s of articles. So, daily I journalize my stuff. Keep this habit and you'll understand how I could crack GMAT in 72 days. It is not by magic. You need to hone your logical reasoning skills.For RC- Don't be bleakly emotional with the cognitive content. If you keep on doing the same RC passages or skim it twice or thrice then you are certainly weak on RC. Familiarity breeds contempt!! But stay focussed for at least 100 days and you can crack your Verbal with a perfect 43/44/45 (-: You know, you don't need a TOEFL score if you have a strong Verbal score on GMAT (-: But give it anyway coz you need to convince your Visa interviewer to make him/her happy.For those who are struggling with Verbal and want to catapult your score, invest in e-GMAT subscription for $199. I never tried it but my friends told me it is cool for a non native.Would suggest T.I.M.E for CAT for sure ....no doubt about that!Full-time faculty members @T.I.M.E are really naive to not to give GMAT and  guess what, GMAT Math is 3 times easier than what I experienced from CAT but GMAT Verbal is 3 times difficult.......nobody might have told you that right (-:Also, nobody might have whispered this to you:GMAT calculates past 3 years percentile scores i.e. close to 22 Lakh scores.CAT just calculates current year percentile scores i.e. close to 2 Lakh scores.http://www.mba.com/india/the-gma...(For example, Yale SOM last year's admission was for 710-720. Now, because so many took the GMAT and many scored beyond 720, the median cut-off for Yale is now 720+ as of 2015 which was 710+ as of 2014!!!)More than 1.29 million people took the GMAT exam in the past 5 years and more than 3.72 million score reports were sent.So, %ile scores are really hard to earn these days.A GMAT score of 750 used to be 99th %ile score in 2005,Now, 750 is considered as 98th %ile score in 2015.That's okay!! You don't need a 750 score. You just need to get beyond 720....Q50,V40 will easily fetch you a Top10 B-school call :)So, if you are intelligent enough to decide for yourself, you might say both exams are super tough.GMAT focusses mainly on Verbal and CAT focusses mainly on Math.For those who really don't understand:AWA (nothing but an argument's analysis = 30 mins)+ IR(hard mix of 12 Qsns i.e. 33-39 sub-Qsns from Quant+Verbal = 30 mins) + Quant (37 Qsns = 75 mins)+ Verbal(41 Qsns = 75 mins)= GMAT :)AWA can be done in 1 session :) Easiest section on GMATHow to get 6.0 AWA....my guide... byheart the template a million times.IR needs crazy reasoning skills.Quant is easy.Verbal can chew up your score into pieces...!!!The exam is for 3.5 hrs. So, visualize your cockpit (-:Keep 10 days reserved for taking mocks prior to your GMAT exam (-:If you are a novice beginner, I'd say 100 days to GMAT or 200 days to CAT.If you are an intermediate, I'd say 75 days to GMAT or 150 days to CAT.If you are an expert, I'd say 60 days to GMAT or 120 days to CAT.In conclusion, if you can crack GMAT with 760, with an extra effort on the Math, you can easily crack CAT with 99.99%ile.My Total Cost for GMAT : approx. Rs.36000 /- (buy books from amazon.in itself, it is actually cheaper than flipkart ;))1. GMAC's Official Guide with 900 Qsns for Rs. 11002.

So, I saved ~6000 bucks (-:Note : Schedule your exam date 2 months prior to your GMAT.Well yes, if you happen to stumble upon GRE, you can download ETS.org's free Powerprep s/w and you can check which exam is better by simulating both the GMATPrep s/w and PowerPrep test s/w......each has 2 mocks for free (-:Tip -> Judge both the exams after studying at least for 1 month prior to taking any simulation test.Both exams are accepted by MBA programs as well.Mostly for Masters/PhD, you take the GRE exam.Mostly for B-schools for MBA (or a relevant PhD), you take the GMAT exam.What is the GMAT equivalent GRE score?Check this:http://www.ets.org/s/gre/flash/b...GMAT Total score = -2080.75 + 6.38*GRE Verbal Reasoning score + 10.62*GRE Quantitative Reasoning scoreThe regression equations:GMAT Verbal score = -109.49 + 0.912*GRE Verbal Reasoning scoreGMAT Quantitative score = -158.42 + 1.243*GRE Quantitative Reasoning scoreSo, V164 minimum on GRE = V40 on GMATand Q168 minimum on GRE = Q50 on GMAT.So, a GRE score of 333 = GMAT score of 750+..'. GRE score of 327 = GMAT score of 700.Note: If you want to send your score for Top10 B-schools, try to get 330+ on GRE.Top B-schools won't tolerate your score after your 3 scored attempts on GMAT and if you've failed to get a good score on GMAT even after 3 scored attempts, I'd say switch to GRE if you are really in a hurry bcoz application deadlines are near and you've exhausted your 3 scored attempts on GMAT already (coz you know each scored attempt can be tracked by Top B-schools).ETS and GMAC are two separate entities now (-:The world is full of possibilities (-:Tips :Try ginger soup coz it raises your heartbeat (-:2 months leave  from  Work/Job (very important step to stay in focus for modus operandi)Now, try to take 10 days out and just auto-play all 300+ video lessons from Magoosh. Quant has some 180 video lessons and Verbal has some 125 video lessons. During these 10 days, don't practice any questions. Just enjoy the content. I completed the entire video lessons in 6 days and I re-played it again and again till I felt confident. Now solve 512 Quant questions and 425 Verbal questions separately. My entire time on Magoosh's website was 31 hrs. Why 31 hrs? bcoz I solved it thrice. All 900+ Qsns and diagnostic test as well. I just loved the Dashboard concept and Customize your practice filters.Solve OG 10th edition 1st and then solve the OG latest edition.People are really naive and don't know how to navigate a forum.

Put 1min 49 secs for all SC/CR/DS/PS Questions and 2-3 mins for the RC passages (90 secs for SC .....to save time for CR and RC during the real exam and 2-3 mins per IR Qsn).Observe the moderators here. Bunuel's posts on gmatclub.com for his ""signature collections"" especially for Quant practice serves best. You'll get another surprise attack of 1000+ Quant Qsns here :-)Do not throw any topic for option!! (as we used to do in our college days..!!!!)Have a self disciplined approach and do not corrupt your mind by watching tons of movies or TV series. Remember that GMAT is a matter of 100 days of study....thats it!!Hydrate your body well. Sleep for at least 8-9 hrs daily for the next 2 months followed by a short nap. REM sleep can do wonders (-:Finally, motivate yourself by comparing B-schools on mba .com's awesome School Finder Tool. Jot down the application deadlines of your dream B-schools and be prepared with LORs, SOPs and Essays for each B-school. Normally people apply in Round 1 and Round 2.For Round 1, be ready by end of August because at least 30%-40% seats are reserved for the 1st pool of applications. For Round 2, be ready with your score by end of December because your GMAT median score might not be upto mark and you really needed some more time. So, for getting an admission abroad, do your research 18 months well in advance :)Never ever apply in Round 3 because seats are already filled up. Hardly 5%-10% seats will be available and tons of people will fight for the same. So, better clock for Round 1 after few months :)I was shitting my pants after I scored 390 570 680 720 on the simulation mocks from GMATPrep s/w !!!...All you need to do is to be technically sound with the GMAT format....The way GMAT tests you and the way you need to test the GMAT (-:OG 10th Edition contains 441 Quant PS Qsns(136 are new), 274 DS Qsns (124 are new) and Verbal (SC-268 + CR-205 + RC-50+ Passages) 700+ Qsns.Get your Manhattan's MGMAT 10 study guides (or only verbal).I've never touched Nova or Kaplan or Barrons or etc. shit!!Every person will tell you a very different story on their roadmap to ace GMAT.....that is what you have to judge for yourself!!Some people will kiss Veritas prep, some will go for Economist Tutor (â‚¹.30k), some will go to youtube to crash their minds and some minds will crash and stick to Youtube playlists.....my sincere suggestion to you is: research more or stick to what I've said :)A bit more advice: Don't join T.I.M.E. or Byju's or Jamboree or Manhattan/Veritas classroom tutoring. These people will tell you what you already know. You just need cool resources and materials and proper time management which I've already discussed with you. Streamline your goals.So, you know for sure that with OG 10th edn, you can easily add 1000 Qsns to the Chart + 3000 Qsns from Mocks (1687 Qsns pool from GMATPrep s/w) + 1000s of extra Qsns from Manhattan + 3000 Qsns from my chart!!So, in all, you'll have to solve nearly 7500+ Qsns to get 750+ on GMAT and do not forget to solve it 2-3 times!!I should write a book on this thingy coz I've cracked it with a 750 score on the GMAT with 72 days of preparation. That is okay as compared to CAT with 140 days of preparation (again depends on your pace and patience).Just 10 weeks of hard work (unlike 20 weeks for CAT)!! I never tried Veritas prep's 6 mocks for $49 or gmatclub .com's 31 tests for $80.You don't need all of that to saturate your head.Even if you buy only 1 Manhattan MGMAT book (say SC) for Rs.1000, you can get an online access to all 6 hard mocks that will be valid for 1 year.Well some last tips:1. AWA score >= 5 and IR score >= 5 .....for Top10 B-schools.2. According to GMAC's new policy, you can cancel your GMAT score report if you think you have performed very badly during the test and you won't have to face the same Qsn on the day of your interview with the top B-school. This also means that if you are determined to crack GMAT in 1 year, you can give this exam and cancel the score 4 times and the B-schools won't notice anything. Well, trust me. You don't need that kind of attempts. At least, you can play the game for the 5th time ;)3. Also, since you know that GMAT is an adaptive test, you must be super alert and focussed to solve the 1st 10 Qsns on GMAT Quant section and the 1st 10 Qsns on GMAT Verbal section correctly during the test. If your initial Qsns are correct and you get 4-5 Qsns wrong at the end of Quant section and 4-5 Qsns wrong at the end of Verbal section, it really doesn't matter. You'll still score 700+ on GMAT.4. Carry a 100gms glucose biscuit and 1 fruit and 1 litre juice/water with you at the time of your GMAT exam and do not forget to wear a sweater because you'll be giving the exam @24Â° C for nearly 226 mins (You'll be given 8 mins break after 1 hour of AWA+IR and 8 mins break after Quant section). At the end of your exam, the GMAC portal will ask you whether you want to keep your score.... So, make this as a #1 thumb rule: Cancel your score report blindly if you don't get a 700+ score on the day of your GMAT exam!! Trust me, this will not only make your heart feel stronger but it will also make you feel more powerful the next time you hit the exam center.Some things I have not told you yet:5000 secs for everyday practice also means that you should give 10000 more secs to review the same (-:I did my entire practice on iPad coz it's sleek. Except for the Study Collection i.e. QsnPack 1 + ExamPack 1 which I did on my laptop.I personally made it sure that I completed at least 70 Qsns as per day's target.My max was 120. So, if you cannot keep up with your pace, you cannot rest on Sundays that is for sure. And I also confess the fact I sequestered myself in my room for 2 long months :-* It chafed me to be confined like this....but ultimately it paid off at the end!!Download ""GoodReader"" app. Now, download previous OG 12th Edition or 13th Edition in PDF format. Now, create an annotated copy and use Highlighter so that you can track your page by page progress and bookmark that page daily.Say, your MGMAT CAT's 6 mocks avg. score = 670 or 680. Well, actually you'll easily get 720-730 score on the real GMAT exam.If you score 710 on the GMATPrep s/w, your actual score on the GMAT will be +10 or -10 i.e. 700 or 720. This software is really precise.In total you'll have 20 mocks: 4 GMATPrep s/w + 6 MGMAT CATs + 10 Free mocks that I mentioned earlier. So, just focus on your Qs and Vs.e.g. IIMs want 49/50/51 on Quant and 43/44/45 on Verbal.For IIMs, you can keep your GMAT score for 2 years (in case you are busy with your international client or you decide to start working on your Startup idea before joining an IIM).And do not hesitate to give your GMAT for a 2nd or 3rd attempt.You know, some B-schools will easily give you a 100% scholarship.Read this:http://blogs.economictimes.india... ....This girl from India got $80000 scholarship and was cordially invited by Cox B-school in the USA.So, just imagine her total MBA financial outlay for subsistence would be very nominal for 2 years including Living/Rent/Utilities/Health insurance/etc....and this is the reason mostly Indian students opt for GMAT for abroad generous scholarships from B-schools.For Canada, Top 5 B-schools have GMAT score requirement of 650-700 only. So, if you score low on GMAT, don't destroy your hopes :) You can still immigrate to Canada in 3 short years :)OrIf your budget is really low i.e. ~$50k, I'd suggest go for MS in MIS only if you are a curious CS grad interested for a career in management in IT in USA or abroad elsewhere (you can work as a Software developer or in Operations or Analyst or etc. with a degree in MIS). MIS mainly requires a GMAT score and it becomes affordable to choose a cool university for the same coz you also know that most MIS programs are STEM related and will give you 2.5 years on OPT (unlike 12 months OPT for MBA). Here, you can save upto â‚¹.5 Lakhs on internship and literally complete your higher education under â‚¹.20 Lakhs abroad if you get a TA/RA i.e. Teaching Assistantship/Research Assistantship (So, shed a good conduct on your Professor and publish a research paper on your topic of specialization before you write your essays for admission).OrGo for a affordable Masters program in the USA (that requires a GMAT score) and after OPT if you find yourself lucky to win a H-1B cap/lottery, you can ask your Employer to fund your Part-time i.e. Weekend MBA program while you are still working on H-1B visa :) Your GMAT score will be still valid and you must use the score for a 2nd time for your MBA. So, tracing your timeline is really essential for this to happen. Alternate way: On OPT you can easily save upto $50k. So, all you need is another $50k. This $50k can be waived with scholarship via high GMAT score. A part-time MBA will take 3 years for completion. It is the same MBA degree (like a traditional/Full-time degree) but this time you won't have to worry about any loan/co-applicant or your Dad's help (-: and the best part is that you'll earn & learn at the same time.OrIf you are a stereotypical engineer or someone who is currently in the pre-final year of your graduation and you have zero Work Ex but if you have a stellar profile, go for Deferred admission: HBS 2+2/ Yale Silver Scholars program/ Stanford GSB deferred enrollment/ Chicago Booth Scholars program/ ISB Young Leaders Program/ IESE Young Talents program/etc. A high GMAT score would certainly increase your chances. What is this program about? It is the same MBA degree but you get to enroll in the 1st year directly after your undergraduate degree. For the next 2 years you'll have to work and in this way, you not only get B-school approved skillset but you also get a guarantee to comeback quickly after 2 years of Work Ex to complete your MBA (In short, if you ask me, you save your 2-3 years of your life since your competition will be with guys with minimum 4-5 years of work ex and you'll stand out to be the best candidate engaged with proper skills when you enter the 2nd year of the MBA program after 3 years).OrIf you've only completed your Bachelors degree, you can directly get into a fully funded PhD program (without the need for a Masters degree) from a reputed University anywhere in the world. A high score on GMAT would be required. So, here's another reason why you would like to spend 5+ years on a research to get an experience with a cool stipend. Why PhD? Coz you can self-petition for your EB2 visa (with tons of research papers) and you can also ask 3-4 employers to petition your H-1B visa in the USA. So, people who really know this directly apply for a doctoral program without giving it a 2nd thought (research more to get a mentor for your R&D in your specialization).For those looking for a Top B-school abroad and need a funding without a collateral/co-signer, just take a loan from Prodigy Finance: http://prodigyfinance.com to pay your entire MBA fees with a cool EMI over a period of 10 years. Hats off to this community initiated by INSEAD+LBS guys :)See, just motivate yourself with such articles and try to get 100% scholarship.Remember, 111-117 Qsns is what will decide your fate on GMAT :)The more you rely on unofficial content, the more you will become vulnerable to a bad score. Magoosh is just for brushing up your skills via tons of tutorials and practice Qsns. And finally, just trust Manhattan blindly bcoz I say so :)And because of the new GMAC's policy, what used to be 89th %ile score i.e. 700 on GMAT...would be 85th %ile in no time. So, quickly register to give the GMAT and keep a 100 days target :) and don't waste your precious time to join any stupid coaching classes....they will mess up your head even more!!!and let's say if at all you need Tuition coaching = 30k goneand let's say you are poor in verbal....e-gmat = 13k goneFor practice.....Magoosh = 6.5k goneFor learning....Manhattan MGMAT Study Guides = 10.5k goneFor official content.....Official Guides + Study Collection = 7k goneFor mocks....let's say you picked gmatclub.com's 33 mock Tests = 5k goneand let's assume you gave the GMAT exam thrice = 50k gone.'. Total = 125k gone.See, it becomes very expensive.Don't bother.Just keep an eye on your golden ticket to B-school via 100% scholarship, which can be upto $80k or about â‚¹.50 Lakhs. That's massive and generous!!Think of it (â‚¹.125k) as an investment in your future.Think of it as the last resort to spearhead your career.What you need is a high level fidelity to Math and English.So, be a lone wolf and try to be as fresh as a duke while studying ;-)Below is a GMAC research data report of past 10 years:Google: ""World Geographic Trend Report for GMAT Examinees""I've saved your efforts....check this:3.72 million Score reports Ã· 1.29 million students = avg 2.8 times!!.'. Each examinee attempts for a 2nd or 3rd time after taking the GMAT exam to earn a very high score to secure an admit to his/her dream B-school....as per new GMAC's policy, you can take the GMAT 5 times in 1 year.Can you do that for CAT in 1 year???Do you have the flexibility such as Round 1 or Round 2 application deadlines for top B-schools in India via CAT??Do you really want to get a -ve score after you hit a wrong option(CAT)??Can you build your accuracy for the non-MCQs with at least 75 marks(25 Qsns) on CAT with exactly 150 secs per Qsn in your hand??Can you beg for a cool scholarship (>=50%) with your CAT score?Plus, can you keep CAT score for at least 2-3 years??You have to actually wait for 1 whole year to take the CAT exam!!Then you start thinking 1st 6 months rest & then next 6 months CAT prep.Lol.....So, people who are lucky to read this post, dedicate 1st 6 months to crack GMAT. Next 6 months to CAT :)Remember, >95th %ile score (>720) for GMAT and >99th %ile score (>200) for CAT :)Here's a GMAT score chart. If you are aspiring for top B-schools, I'd say paste this chart above your head where you sleep and just dream about this triangle for the next 100 days (-: Your eyes should target V40 and Q50 (at the minimum).â€‹GMAT wiki search result:The GMAT does not measure business knowledge or skill, nor does it measure intelligence. According to the test owning company, the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving abilities, while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success.Coming to CAT:Didn't look at NCERT Std 6th to Std 12th books.Didn't do Arun Sharma a favor.Had no time at all for T.I.M.E. coaching (coz I was working) nor I wanted to get crammed with 40 people in a room which is supposed to be a room for a batch of 30 people.Have a really great shortcut to crack CAT....Career Launcher has Test series.Enroll with CAT TS+TG (Test Series + Test Gym) product:http://www.clexams.com/You have to shell off â‚¹.4000 for the same.Now, you must get hooked to CLexams.com portal for at least 100 days.It had cost me an entire day to figure out how the fuck should I approach to crack 8500 Qsns.So, made a really cool chart yet again:â€‹Tests pe Tests....Turns out Test Gym has 741 Tests in total.Test Gym Lite has:276 Tests for Quant.100 Tests for DI/LR.365 Tests for Verbal.31 full-length mocks and 45 sectional tests + 24 more from Test Gym Classic.Keep last 15 days for mocks. Again, go step by step. Complete 10-12 tests per day. Bookmark those hard ones.For pocket prep....download the MBA Exams Guide app from the Playstore.1 Test = 7 Qsns..'. 10-12 Tests = 70-84 Qsns per day's target.So, don't be gobsmacked coz it takes ~15 mins to solve a single Test.Again, don't forget to reset everything and solve it twice and thrice.Do the above and you'll get 99.99 %ile for sure.I made this decision coz I already gave the GMAT and I was strong with my Verbal and Math skills and most importantly, I was mentally set for solving those 8500 Qsns.And don't worry about getting a 99 %ile in your CL mocks.CL mocks are much tougher than the actual CAT exam.All Qsns are neatly refined to ace your CAT exam.So, even if you get 85-90 %ile in the CL mocks that would easily culminate into a 99th %ile score on the day of your CAT exam :-)So, be happy that you can actually ace the CAT in just 4000 bucks.Okay, I exaggerated a bit. You need â‚¹.2000 to buy Arun Sharma books.And download NCERT books too :)Do remember this: CAT will hit you with minimum 25 non-MCQs. Also, the concept of LR on CAT is pretty hard and you won't get enough time to solve 12 Qsns on LR. So practice real hard.(So, if you could get 15 Qsns correct in each section i.e. VA, DI/LR & QA you'd end up with a 90th %ile score on CAT. But if you can score 22-23 Qsns correctly in each section, you'd get a 99th %ile score....that's my analysis).Warning: Don't skip NCERT and Arun Sharma books if you have not given the GMAT exam 1st and you just wanna give the CAT exam 1st coz you'll have to dedicate 1st 30 days refreshing your skills for CAT Math itself. This is something not to be trifled with leniently. So, slap yourself and re-read my entire post again.Your head will be completely packed with 15000+ Qsns after GMAT and CAT.So, don't play all the cards at once (-:Remember, you still have a full marathon race before you :) From a monetary point of view, if you observe, only 12%-15% people giving CAT can afford to take the GMAT (or there are tons of other reasons for taking CAT.....job/support family/business....for execs/career in India/limited H-1B visas in USA/short OPT period of only 1 year for MBA guys in USA/cannot afford to sacrifice 6-7 years to repay $400k debt to Prodigy Finance if you have a H-1B visa/cannot afford to sacrifice 11-12 long years to repay $400k debt to Prodigy Finance in Indian currency/etc.).Advice on B-school debt by Warren Buffett:GMAT or CAT is not about a formidable challenge. It is about the ability to endure hardship against your sedentary ass!!And before you enter this mad quest just be sure to get at least 20+ genuine verified certifications (e.g. Business Informatics/Venture Finance/Statistics/Entrepreneurship/Innovation/Analytics/Accounting/Leadership/Digital Planning/Marketing/Finance/Strategy/Management/Economics/Operations/Critical Thinking/Creative Writing/Public Speaking/etc.) from Coursera :) to be well ahead of the competition to not to show empathy after a ""failed Startup"" situation in your essays. Trust me, it works even with Harvard ;-)And why I've emphasized on Top10 B-schools?It's an axiom of marketing: Reputation matters!!!And why did I give both the exams?It will take me 3000 more words to write exclusively and prove it to you ""Why not both the exams??"".So, anticipate your death after 25,000 days and just take out 250 days to crack GMAT and CAT.Chao*Best of Luck (-:+1Kudos=Thanks (-:","There is no competition between these two.How can you compare a Hayabusa and a Harley Davidson bike, both are made for different approaches.Similarly a Gmat exam and a Cat exam requires different set skills like-GMAT has an easier quant than Cat.Cat requires you to have a top notch academic background.A coaching institute of CAT in India will require you to study for various other exams conducted by private b-schools to which makes your study harder and this takes 12â€“15 months of studies.The % of people in India taking GMAT exam are times less than people appearing for Cat.The above point makes the Cat exam tougher as you need to top among the toppers for your entry in top Indian B-schools.But the story does not end here because a CAT exam may be tougher on paper but GMAT takes the toughness to another level.CAT has a nominal fees of 2,000 approx but if you are not a general category your exam will be done within 1,000/- Rupees only. On the other hand GMAT exam will tear you savings if you are not financially strong i.e it requires a sum of 16,000 rupees for one exam (if you want to give it 5 times in a year be ready to starve)The CAT exam is conducted by Indian Authorities only in and for India but a caste category person can beat you up with lower score in CAT if you belong to General category. This reservation do not exists in GMAT making it much of a true potential exam.CAT exam is tougher than a GMAT exam but do you know what you have to go through after getting a great score in both.For CAT you have to face an interview in that applied top B-school and if everything goes right then you are in.While GMAT topper has to start his 3â€“4 year journey until they apply to the top B-school. This requires you to have a job experience, good social background, extra curricular enthusiast, an enhanced leadership skill and at last top notch English communication. (This is why GMAT scores are kept valid for 5 years.This is because the foreign schools prefer practical skills than a theoretical knowledge which i thinks India lags somewhere.And last but not the least the expense in foreign colleges is much more than any other college in INDIA. So if you can work hard continuously for at least 5 years then go for it you will definitely get admitted with wavier and scholarships.","The Graduate Management Admission Test, popularly known as GMAT is probably the most important exam that can help you to get into the best MBA schools across the world. Beginning in 1953, GMAT is conducted by the Graduate Management Admission Council. The scores are accepted by over 2100 schools worldwide and for 5900 programs.Needless to say, this exam is one of the important steps that will help you to get into your chosen B-School. Though the GMAT exam is not the only factor for getting admission in the B-Schools, a good enough GMAT score makes the rest of the admission procedure incredibly easy.The GMAT exam is conducted at regular intervals all over the world and essentially contains four sections â€“ the analytical writing assessment (AWA), Integrated Reasoning, Quantitative and Verbal. The total duration of the test is three and a half hours and one score anything between 200 and 800.Like any other examination, the GMAT has its own challenges. It is one of the toughest MBA entrance tests and the very fact that it gives you access to the Top 10 colleges across the world shows its reach. The best part about GMAT is the fact that it is conducted multiple times in a year and hence a student can decide to take the test anytime depending on when they feel their preparation is up to the mark, unlike most Indian MBA entrance tests.Here are 5 tips on how to up your GMAT game.1. Fix the Test Date after you start preparingThe tendency for students irrespective of which part of the world they belong to is to keep the exam preparations for the last moment. But serious test takers will start preparing long in advance. For the lazy test taker, we suggest that you start preparing first and then later decide the date when you will take the test. If after three months of preparation you feel confident enough to take the test, sign up for the nearest test date. This way you will not wait for the last moment to start preparing. The larger aim of the test preparation comes into play here. Instead of preparing because you have to take the test, you prepare first and then decide to take the test.2. Study continuously, not sporadicallyLike most tests that assess your understanding of a variety of subject matters, you need to be in constant touch with the study material for GMAT as well. It does not help if you start studying mid way and then decide to resume after a weekâ€™s gap. This not only breaks the continuity of your preparation but also makes you forget valuable concepts and techniques. Thus being continuously in touch with your test preparation is needed. A one or two day break is acceptable, but anything longer would only bring down your level of preparation.3. Take a GMAT prep test to see where you standThe GMAT website offers two free prep tests that all test takers can avail. The best way to assess where you stand before you start preparing is to take one of these tests and see the scores and compare them against what you aim to achieve. They give a fair understanding of your current aptitude in GMAT and which ones are your problem areas. The only hazard with these free prep tests is that they are not adapted to empirical, standardized test results and can possibly give you a different understanding of your position. You can also always take the tests available on Princeton, Kaplan, Manhattan etc. and then use a GMAT Score Estimator/Calculator to find your real GMAT equivalent. Once you have started preparing, take as many prep tests as you can because only then can you gauge your own progress. Use your first score as the lowest limit and set a target score. If you prepare right, all the tests that you take must only point towards you reaching the target score.4. Discover your weakness and work on itEvery test taker has their weakness. Some are strong in quant but finds the verbal section problematic. On the other hand, someone may be very strong in verbal but quant is where they require some serious practice. Most people go for coaching classes but since most of these classes focus on both on Quant and Verbal, a person who is strong in one of these benefits from only half the material provided. It is, therefore, preferable to go for one-on-one coaching or study through an online course. It not only helps you to get individual and undivided attention but also allows you to choose what exactly you want to study depending on your need.5. Decide your own time milestonesThe nightmare of every test taker is not being able to finish a test. As children, all of us have had those dreams of time running out and our exam papers being blank. With a time-sensitive test like GMAT, it is quite possible that you might run out of time causing you to take random guesses that would do you more bad than good. The cleverest thing to do here is to see how much time each question will take and then set milestones that you need to achieve. For example, in the quant section, you must reach the seventh question with 60 minutes remaining and the fifteenth question with 45 minutes remaining on the clock. This way if you see you are falling behind early enough, you can speed up and finish the section smoothly.The key to getting a good GMAT score is knowing the right techniques and having the right amount of practice along with good time management skills. This test truly prepares you for the challenges of management career!All the best!Some useful resources:GMAT Prep: Critical Reasoning DecodedB-School Admission: Written Ability Test (WAT) and Personal Interview (PI)","GMAT & CAT have the same syllabus, both deal with Mathematics and English. Both tests complement each other. Preparing for GMAT helps CAT aspirants in verbal, and CAT preparation helps GMAT aspirants in Quantitative Section. Most of the sections in both the tests are common.MBA admission is a steep road. It's important to keep all doors open. It's good to be confident, but there is a thin line difference between confidence and over-confidence. CAT success rate (% of students getting admission in good colleges) is meager. GMAT, on the other hand, opens doors for almost all the global and Indian business schools.One more misconception about GMAT is that it's only for rich. A Business school is not ""Global"" if it does not keep ""Currency Disparity"" in their mind. That's why they offer scholarships to aspirants from lower-valued currency countries. Almost all the Indian students end up getting scholarships to study abroad.Note for Graduation Final Year Students:Business schools accepting GMAT scores need at least 2+ Years work experience. But then also it makes more sense to give GMAT with CAT. The first reason is GMAT score is valid for five years.Secondly, It's much better to have a GMAT score before selecting business schools. It gives time to aspirants to work on their needed profile.Thirdly, Taking out study time is much easier in student life compared to that in job times. Most of the working applicants find it very difficult to take time out for studies.Lastly, CAT success rate is meager compared to GMAT. Till your overall %ile is touching 99, you are not a serious candidate for IIM-A, B & C. And if your %ile is lower than 98%, you have to go for tier-2 B-schools only.GMAT & CAT Section-wise Analysis:Verbal Section  Sentence Correction: Both exams require candidates to spot grammatical errors. There is one manageable difference. GMAT SC is based on American English while CAT SC is based on British English.   Reading Comprehension: The passages in the CAT and GMAT are almost equally cryptic. RC in GMAT is more difficult than that in CAT.  Critical Reasoning: GMAT CR is tougher than CAT CR. If you are prepared for GMAT CR, then CAT CR is a cakewalk.Quantitative SectionCAT preparation will make GMAT Quant a kid's play. The good news is that many CAT topics such as logarithms, trigonometry, calendars, clocks, shares, etc are not tested in GMAT.Analytical writing assessmentGMAT tests your clarity of thinking in this section. It looks for content, the organization of thought process, language skills and writing mechanisms in evaluating the essays. The good news is that the AWA is not a tough section to ace.Visit www.EduShastra.com for more details."
CAT,"Which coaching is best for CAT in Delhi: Time, Tathagat (cp) or CL?",https://www.quora.com//Which-coaching-is-best-for-CAT-in-Delhi-Time-Tathagat-cp-or-CL,"Exams and Tests in New Delhi, CAT Coaching, Test Preparation and Coaching in New Delhi, Coaching Exams and Tests, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching, New Delhi, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",22,"To begin with, CAT basically tests a candidate on English and Maths, subjects which we study for around 15 years of our lives. If one is motivated enough, one can easily cross the 80-90 percentile barrier depending on their clarity of concepts.The coaching institutes will only benefit a person, if one is willing to put in the labour.Now coming to the institutes, TIME and CL have been in the game for too long and they have batches starting almost every week. They also have a number of teachers teaching the same subjects, so you cannot really experience which faculty is the best. Then TIME also has elite batches wherein only students from top colleges are admitted. Generally, the 100 percentilers are from the elite batches.Then there are the new entrants like Tathagat and MBAguru. From what I have heard is that Tathagat’s English faculty is better. Both of these institutes understand that quora is a medium people want their answers from and as a result they have their people writing praise for themselves on quora.Simply put, these institutes are out there to your money which amount to around ₹45–50k. They have receptionists calling themselves as counsellors who would probably influence your minds so as to believe that theirs is the best institute out there.Most of the people joining these institutes are people who are directionless after having finished their graduation and think that MBA would bring prosperity in their lives.To summarise it, if you are motivated enough and are willing to put in the labour, you can study yourselves and then later enrol for their mock tests.However, if you are directionless and just want to get an MBA, join either of these institutes. There's going to be no spoon feeding even after you pay a hefty sum. The teachers would continue to teach at their pace so as to cover all the topics before your exams notwithstanding whether or not you are able to understand things in class.I don't know if I could help with this answer. I can continue to write about how everything is wrong with these institutes but then that isn't going to help either. So, if you are motivated enough and are sure of why you want an MBA enrol for any of these institutes, it wouldn't matter much.","I am writing both - the procs and cons of joining TGPro - In TG, English faculty, Mr Kumar, is like everything you have got. Teaching under him, is like a gift that God has somehow bestowed to you. He is, no doubt, is the best faculty ever in Delhi and legend of this era. Having had word him, if you speak to any other faculty somewhere else, then only you can substantiate and realize how substandard other might have. Other is Mr Kamal for Quant, he is again genius. For Quant yo may perhaps find other good faculty in other institutes, but his humbleness and availability for doubts shall engross you. He is brilliant Mathematician but you need to chase his pace. Concept of workshops here in TG is their USP. It's like, do some self study at home and miss normal classes, but having attend the workshop you can cope with what you have missed out.Cons - They don't give, even a slightest of bit, to complete the course timely. Irrespective of either you join in Jan/Feb or June, they shall reach the post by CAT time only. They never work out strategies to get the course done by stipulated timelines. Lack of Management - You wont have ID cards till their test series, no intimation for abrupt change in the class timing, mode of communication is FB - severest flaw that they have. They claim back ups, sure you shall get but it till July only. After that what they do is, they club up the two batched to cover up the course speedily; in this case its clear there wont be any space in classroom, thereby no back. Test Series is not up to mark. You need to go for someones's else. But don't keep this as the limiting factor. To recapitulate, you need to make settlement with cons, if you can, then only join TG. One Axiom - If you are in love with language, even an iota of it, listening to Mr Kumar is life long experience.  ","It was in my Btech 6th sem when I was searching for an MBA institute where I could start my CAT preparation. My Phone was flooded by calls from all the BRANDS and standard names CAREER LAUNCHER, TIME etc. I was so damn confused as someone was offering scholarships, some were sharing their past success records wherever possible (Mails, on Call, Messages , Whatsapp etc.)Suddenly one day my cousin called up and said bro why don’t you try that institute on Barakhamba road , he dint know the name of institute , all he arranged for me is a number of his friend who attended the institute and an adjective for the faculty (Wahan pe English ke Choti wale sir hain bhai bahut faadpadhate hain ) .This is all I knew about Tathagat until I went to the place and learnt more about totalgadha group and of course all the faculties.I planned to join the institute just on the basis of this word to mouth publicity and marketing being done by the students of TATHAGAT and then somebody just came to me and said “bhai dande se padhna hai to TathaGat join krle or agar khud hi bahut ache se padhai kr skta hai to koi bhi institute kyun join krna hai” and I realized the kind of person I am ( as I lack concentration , not very disciplined in my study schedules , a large social circle etc.) this institute can actually make me study either by choice or by force.Next weekend onwards I was a TGITE, from the very first day I could see the fear psychosis of not being allowed to attend the sessions with incomplete work started working for me, I never read any books and novels but yes KUMAR SIR (the so called English wale sir) made everybody read at least one novel/book a week. Even I used to finish my weekly tasks, which helped me to be in touch with the syllabus everyday rather than just attending a weekly session and then books closed till next session.Now the preparation was not maths and English , infcat it was broken into modules which are actually needed to be learnt and practiced (Quant , RC, SC ) . In my case I have this childhood fear with mathematics , I have never been able to score in mathematics , but here I actually improved on my question tackling techniques rather than mathematics , I won’t say my maths improved miraculously or anything superlative rather I just learnt to handle many problems of mathematics by simple logic rather than formulas and calculations.Sessions with KUMAR Sir were most absorbing , those sessions were not just about SC or RC or a particular topic rather the sessions were a pool of abundant knowledge share and transfer, he used to talk about history , biology , music , science and almost everything , those sessions could be never ending if one actually wants to sit and listen. In the later part of the sessions TG used to organize practice and revision workshops and trust me those workshops are more than worth , this is the platform that even if you have not given your 100% and you feel your preparation is not upto the mark , these workshops are just wonderful you can cover up the whole Course and practice everything just double up your efforts during these workshops and you will be through.For those looking forward for joining an MBA preparation Institute I would suggest Tathagat will give you a real and honest platform where you can learn and improve upon your aptitude and overall personality which you may or may not learn in your graduation school.","Tathagat was a waste of money (Rs. 61,000) and time(2 months). they give decent teachers for first 15 days which is their refund period and then the people who teach from there on are not up to the mark.Verbal teachers are decent though the atmosphere in the class is usually depressing (Mr. Kumar who is their GOD is just an overrated teacher who lost his touch many years ago ad also thinks “Rousseau and Darwin befkoof hai salle” ). Don't even consider going there for quant., all the teachers are below average. Out of 4 teachers for quant., only 1 was willing to teach and clearing doubts (he also happen to teach only in the first 15 days) and the case was pretty similar for verbal as well.The administration doesn’t know how to behave, they are extremely rude and need some classes on basic civic behaviour. I was asked to “shut up and get out” for asking for a refund due to some financial constraint and unsatisfactory services (since it’s a business)My experience was simply writing down stuff from the board with practically no discussion in the class. Other than this the place is located in a very shady place, and the suffocating classrooms often have tiny mice running around.Also, this is very funny but turns out most of the good reviews about them online are given by themselves or by students to avail discount (great marketing trick though)"
CAT,What kind of cat do you have?,https://www.quora.com//What-kind-of-cat-do-you-have,"CAT Preparation, Cats (domestic), Common Admission Test (CAT), Pets",9,"I have a Bengal and “a mutt.” The “mutt” is a little rescue cat I got through a rescue outfit in my region. I bought my Bengal from her first owner who had to move out of the country for his job. The Bengal is stand-offish and not affectionate/cuddly. My rescue is affectionate/cuddly but nurses on her thigh whenever I pet her, an indication that she was weaned too early. I love them both. My Bengal is very smart - typical of the breed - and often demanding of attention, also typical of the breed, which she lets me know by knocking stuff off my desk and bureaus. I had three Siamese siblings before these two. One lived for 16 years, another for 18, and their sister for nearly 20. I grieve for all of them; they were the sweetest, cuddliest, most affectionate cats imaginable. But I raised them from the age of 6 weeks, held them, cuddled them, sang and talked to them. That’s what’s necessary for socializing a kitten to humans.","Mr Beau is a seal point Siamese. He’s from a breed rescue, so I don’t have his papers, but I know his breeder.Jacky Roo Roo is a black tuxedo.

CAT,"What is the best CAT coaching institute in Pune with respect to the performance and success rate of its students, study materials that they provide, experienced faculty, infrastructure etc.",https://www.quora.com//What-is-the-best-CAT-coaching-institute-in-Pune-with-respect-to-the-performance-and-success-rate-of-its-students-study-materials-that-they-provide-experienced-faculty-infrastructure-etc,"Test Preparation and Coaching, CAT Coaching, Infrastructure, CAT Preparation, Best of X, Common Admission Test (CAT)",48,"In December 2013, I joined CAT classroom program at IMS Deccan for CAT 2014. Had a decent experience. Like you mentioned the faculty members are good. Diwakar Sir is excellent. I attended most of the classes. The notes are great. And although I didn't take any mock tests, I've had people tell me, that the mocks are pretty close to CAT. Anyway, due to some unavoidable reasons (A story for some other time), I didn't take CAT that year.Next year, December 2014, I was thinking of joining a coaching institute for CAT 15, as I had lost touch, and had to start with the basics. I thought of joining IMS again as they were offering me some loyalty discount. Around 30%. I wasn't thinking straight at that time. Thankfully, I have a close friend who talked some sense into me, at that time. He told me it was useless attending the same lectures (where they would discuss the same handouts) again, when you've attended most of them. So even if you have to pay more, it makes more sense to join TIME. And I joined TIME Deccan for CAT 2015.I attended all the lectures. Took around 20 mocks out of 25. The faculty which I had, were equally good. And the notes are good. Mocks are excellent (Read more difficult than the actual CAT) The only difference I felt was that the quality of students at TIME was much better. At IMS I had around 15 people in my class. At TIME I had around 40 people. But that pushed me a little. To try and answer questions in class, faster than the others. The atmosphere was competitive. This is what lacked at IMS. It was more interactive at TIME. And the quant faculty used to push us for solving questions faster. I don't remember him solving a lot of questions on the board. It could be that the experience that I had at TIME, might not be the same for everyone. The way they teach varies with the faculty members. I know some faculty members solve everything on the board. Remember, this method is suitable for many people. A lot of people in my class used to complain sometimes of the faculty member being too fast. A lot of people want the solutions to be written on the board.Apart from this i don't see any difference between IMS Deccan and TIME Deccan.SO was my decision right? To go with TIME for CAT 2015? FOR ME, YES!Edit : I cannot comment on CL, or for that matter any of the online coaching websites, as I have no experience with them. ","I am from SPARK Education Services, Pune’s fastest growing CAT coaching institute.We train students for CAT and other MBA entrance exams. All the faculty members of SPARK have around 10 years’ experience in teaching for these exams.

Have a nice day.","For any aspirant, the following factors are of prime importance when it comes to joining a coaching institute:1. Personal attention - I think the most important factor is this. If personal attention and mentoring is missing, don't join. When you are evaluating institutes, go and check their classrooms for batch size. Ask for a demo session, if possible.2. Faculty - In addition to point 1, look for people who have gone through the whole process as they can understand you better and guide you better. Ask for faculty details. See if you can talk to them. 3. Content/Material/mocks - Don't think this is a differentiating factor these days because almost every coaching institute is giving more or less the same content and volume of the content. But look for institutes where content is getting frequently updated to match the recent trends. As I said, not a differentiating factor. Mocks used to be a differentiating factor, but a lot of online players are offering free mocks now.4. Location - You should be in a position to reach the coaching institute easily so that you don't spend time traveling. Becomes very important in the months of August-November.5. Course coverage and fees - I personally think the big established players are charging way too much for what they are offering. I have stopped recommending the big institutes for this reason. Considering exam fees and institute applications, a serious candidate will easily spend 15-20,000 INR. Don't see the point of spending around 40,000 on a coaching institute just to feel good that you are doing something and gather material which you are never going to solve.In essence, to any aspirant, my recommendation is: Look for all these factors. Don't fall for marketing gimmicks like 'India's number 1 trainer/coaching institute' or '2000+ IIM calls' and see if you are getting more 'value' for the 'cost' being incurred. Ask for more. You are worth it.Disclaimer: I run a CAT coaching institute with some of the best brains I have seen in my life so my suggestion is going to be biased. But I would still like you to consider Learningroots while deciding on a coaching institute. Hope this helps!","To be honest don't go by the brand but go by the amount of effort put by QUALITY teachers behind which is none in TIME / CL or IMS. I would suggest you to attend a trial class. First at TIME, then IMS and then GENESIS MENTORS at Pune. I am saying this not because i will get anything out of it but because I have already got a lot from Genesis mentors in terms of not only education but attitude and perception towards myself and life which I feel is necessary since all of us know that CAT preparation is not just about aptitude but also about personality development.Now a brief about Genesis:A temple!Yes! where your books are your GOD and the priests make sure you can come and pray anytime you want . *only condition you are serious enough not by words but by work!DI/LR & Quant - As soon as i hear Quant, only name that echo in my mind : Sandeep Sir. Well Have you ever felt that you are a master in a topic but you will still attend a class if THAT guy teaches? He is THAT person/teacher/guru/mentor. every class you attend will fill you with gratitude that *Acha aise bhi Question solve hote hain*.Believe me ! words are not enough to define his magic. Go and check out.Anurag Sir- Veteran in his field , makes sure that your adrenaline level never goes below while solving questions. the kind of intensity he brings in his teaching you will realize that yes You are in the Right hands. aur agar kabhi galti se ye pta chal gya ki your performance is going down, then you won't even realise kab aur kahan your exile will start unless you make sure ki ISS baar to Score karna hi hai .Shreelina Ma'am: now Verbal Ability or English as you may know it is nightmare for most of us. For me especially was Achilles heel. first time I gave Cat i didn't even realize Mera answer galat kaise ho gya :P Honestly I never knew that English could be taught in such a way . English becomes pure logic. Trust me... she makes sure you enjoy English more than Quant or LR.Now that's what my experience was.I haven't mentioned about their experience :P for that you can read on Genesis Mentors .CAT was not my day(92+)  but XAT ... 99.**with 98 %ile in Verbal & I need not remind you XAT level of Verbal.So Don't go by the old age brands.... and even don't go by my words but at least go and check out yourself after reading this.all the best!"

CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,"What coaching institute out of IMS, Time and CL in Guwahati is appropriate for the CAT exam? There are confusions because every institute publicizes itself as the best.",https://www.quora.com//What-coaching-institute-out-of-IMS-Time-and-CL-in-Guwahati-is-appropriate-for-the-CAT-exam-There-are-confusions-because-every-institute-publicizes-itself-as-the-best,"CAT Coaching, IMS, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",13,"The best Coaching for CAT would be @ CAREER LAUNCHER Guwahati. The most important part for preparing for CAT is to get the guidance needed to crack the same. The one point that puts Career Launcher Guwahati apart is the fact that 1-2-1 mentoring is very much promoted and students feel at ease to get their queries solved. Even if you miss classes for genuine reasons, rest assured you will get that class again with some other batch. The class sheets are designed in such a way that all important aspects are covered. 90% of the Class sheets are done by the faculties in class wherein various methodologies are discussed simultaneously. Concept building is paramount in CL Ghy classes followed by short methods to do the same. I am not using “Tricks” as I find it insulting to a beautiful subject like Maths. If you are a serious student and regularly attend classes, then fortifying your understanding of the topics via “Test Gym” i.e Online Topic tests provided by CL goes a long way in improving the way you see at questions.1)The Quant and LR faculty are exceptionally good. English is actually good if you want to learn but it gets a little boring sometime ( my personal experience). CL is probably the only center where attendance for Quant is the highest since most of the concepts are taught by the center head himself. The teaching style at the center is that they take your understanding for that topic to be zero and start from scratch. Slowly the level is increased and advanced ideas are introduced. Even arts students like these sessions and look forward for those classes. The faculty for LR also is a very sincere lady who gets to basics before solving complex puzzles and other LR questions. The sessions are fun to attend and enriching. I remember a student in our batch who got enrolled in a CAT batch with Govt Jobs in his mind. He cleared Federal Bank Clerk this year and happily walked away.2)The Batch size hovers around 15-25 with a seat capacity of 30. So its not very crowded or intimidating in the classroom and since its an AC classroom, its quite comfy which helps you concentrate on what is being taught rather than the regulator of the fan J. The students come from varied background and you will have Engineers Commerce and Arts students discussing LRDI and Quant together. Classes that are missed by the students are adjusted with some other batch and hence a big relief.3)CL SIS – This is at the heart of your preparation. Its like a FB account where you have your own username and password and your own individual account. It has various tool like A) Vocab Ninja ( A word power game that lets you earn coins and benchmark yourself against all the students across India. You get a pretty much idea of where you stand when you see the toppers list in the Topper rankings given and makes you word 10x more. B) All India Mocks – These mocks are designed in such a way that they come closest to a CAT exam. Also, you analyse your own preparation vs your peers across India and get Overall as well as sectional percentiles along with the scores .Since CL ecosystem in India has a huge CAT subscriber base, your percentile is much closer to what you will eventually end up getting in the actual examination. There is an option of “Overall Percentile Graph” which gives you the relationship between a particular score and the corresponding percentile at that score. This helps you to know how much did the 99%iler got and how much extra marks you would need to reach there. Once you appear for these mocks, there is an analysis zone with solutions. There are other statistical data too which gives you information like your accuracy and the type ( Easy/ Moderate/ Difficult) of questions you probably missed out on. Analysis a Mock test is paramount and which if not done makes the whole mock go waste. The most important tool that it has, as far as these Mocks are concerned, is the fact that it will be followed by a Video analysis which is done by the Gurus of Aptitude like Gautam Puri (GP) who solve these mocks themselves and make you aware of the strategies they use to attempt that paper. Even watching them do it adds a lot of value to oneself and the understanding of how to strategize in a paper like CAT. C) Topic Tests – This section checks your competency in various Topics from each of the three sections of English, LRDI and Quant. For example after you have finished the Chapter “Percentages”, you can check your learnings in Topic “Percentages” in the topic test section. This topic is further subdivided into Basic, Advanced and Expert and each having around 10-15 sets. These tests are time bound so you do not have the entire day to solve it but around 15mins to solve roughly 7 questions. Your regularity in giving topic tests make you competent in that Topic. D) Sectional Tests – These tests will check your competency of the whole section and all the topics that fall under it. These tests are a natural progression for someone who has finished the Topic tests and now ready for the next level. E) CAT Score Booster – This section first makes you Jot down your strengths and the areas where you need an improvement. It will be your very own weaknesses and strengths jotted down by you on your own. As an added feature you self-analyse each Mock. Your self-analysis will be used by the system to present you with a heat map of the analysis Thus, compare your net tally and your heat map over time to get a fair idea of where you need to improve. F) Drill Down Analysis -Experience a detailed breakdown analysis of each mock. Know the topics that you are performing well in by analyzing the correct and incorrect attempts in each topic, for a mock. G) Master Series are 10 mock video recording attempts by CL Gurus: GP, Gejo, Shivku, GB. These video recordings show how these aptitude gurus go about solving a mock and their strategy for each section. This is provided to help students learn about different tactics and strategies that can help you score the maximum.4)Students First – There was an issue in our batch for CAT’17 where we all complained about a Faculty who used to be dis-interested in the class and used to ask students to do most of the sums at home. The center replaced the faculty within a short time of 7 days much to our relief. I am sure this wont happen in any of the Coaching centers neither in Guwahati nor India.5)GD/PI – GD/PI/WAT are part of the programme. The center has a clean track record of sending students to top B-Schools including undergrads for IPM-IIM Indore. Students who only come to attend these sessions have a fairly high conversion rate. The whole session is a no-nonsense session where no one talks about how you should dress except the fact that you should not be loud. The sessions whole revolves around you as a person and how to make the interview feel pleased by the answers you give. Offcourse this needs a lot of planning and mock PIs till you make your answers above satisfactory. CL Guwahati GD/PI programme when compared to a lot of soft skill training centers who charge the sky, is much more effective and result oriented.6)Powered by Best Rated CAT Test Series : Get a comparative section wise analysis and overall analysis for each mock that you take. Percentile predictor tells you where you stand compared to over a lakh students who have written mocks of similar level of difficulty over the years and cracked http://CAT.CAT aspirants rate CL Test Series as the closest to the actual exam. Be at your best with tools like Drill-Down Analysis, Time-Wasted Analysis, LIVE Mock attempts by CL faculty members, and the industry's only Artificial Intelligence-based CAT %ile predictor. Since most of the students all over India opt for CL test series, the percentile that you get in these mocks is pretty much close to the actual percentile that you get in the actual exam. The simple rule is, more the sample, closest the result. A classroom preparation without a good test series is like a ship without a sail. The whole strategy to crack the exam is built via these mocks in which offcourse, CL is the leader.7)Most Trusted Results - 19,020 IIM calls in CAT 2016. 104 selections in IIM-A, 174 selections in IIM-B, 157 selections in IIM-C: in PGP batch 2017-19. These results are audited hence no room for playing around. The topper Rittu Paul got into IIM-Lucknow this year i.e 2018 grom Guwahati center.8)Last but not the least, Career Launcher- Guwahati with its approachable faculty base and backed by robust AI ( Artificial Intelligence) driven online support plus the well-researched study materials are a good value for your hard earned money.At the end, I wish you All the best for CAT preparation… May the Force be with you :-)","Undoubtedly, IMS Guwahati is best among the three institute in Guwahati. It is the best coaching insitute for CAT entrance preparation as well as for other MBA entrance exam like MAT & XAT.I can help to figure you out the confusion part by this succeed students who have achieved their best results with their dream B- school insitute in India.IMS has been nationally preparing students for entrance tests at all levels, since 1977. They have a dominating presence in Guwahati with two centres. IMS Guwahati comprises of a team of mentors who are alumni of premier institutes like IIM Ahmedabad, IIT Bombay, XLRI Jamshedpur etc. The centre has produced all India toppers in all India based competitive exams like CAT, MAT, XAT, GMAT & GRE.Well researched study materials, personalised mentoring and online learning resources are hallmarks of their training programs, making IMS Guwahati the best coaching institute of Assam.Over the years IMS Guwahati has been regarded as the best coaching institute in Guwahati, Assam for all India based competitive exams MBA CAT / MAT & others.I think these information that i gave to you is enough to clear your confusion. If you want to know more just click and check IMS centres in Guwahati","CAREER LAUNCHER Guwahati is undoubtedly a centre that doesn't disappoint. The Center Head himself teaches Quant and DI and is available 24*7 in whatsapp. Other faculties from English and LR are also worth mentioning and from whom i have learned a lot apart from academics. The best part is that you will find students from other reputed coaching institutes repeating their coaching with CL which itslef is a proof that its actually good. Needless to mention that their Mock Test Series is amongst the best and Study materials well researched. The fact that the faculties are so approachable is what makes it the best. Faculties wont shy away from questions being posed to them and are ever ready to help. This becomes even more important if you are that kind of person whos a little introvert. The class environment gives each an equal opportunity for questions being asked. The CAT classes are tough since unlike others, they dont solve Bank/SSC sheets but solve CAT sheets. However the weak students get an opportunity to sit for other classes or even one-to-one to solve their doubts which is not the case with other centers where faculties outside classrooms are hard to find. If you are serious about CAT or any similar competitive exam, CL is the place to be…All the best and keep focussed.","I had joined IMS Guwahati CAT coaching centre.Pros of joining IMS:1. Mixed Batch Size: Usually one batch comprises of students from diverse educational back grounds like arts, commerce, science, engineering etc giving everyone opportunity to interact with the teacher. This is particularly helpful for those students who claim themselves as introvert. CAT, XAT, SNAP, MAT etc require candidates to compete at a national level and having a mixed batch help one to gauge performance with students of different backgrounds.2. Flexibility of Batch: Very flexible batch schedule which caters to individual need. If you are a working professional/college student, then you need not to worry as 3–4 batches runs parallel to each other and you can find a batch which is most suitable to your routine. Even you can attend different batches on same day if you have less time to complete the syllabus.3. Faculty: Most of the IMS Guwahati faculties provides constant motivation to work hard and are loved by all. Small anecdotes during classes keep students on the right track. Quant faculty of IMS is one of the sincere team you will find in Guwahati and their approach of teaching and solving student problems on personal level is intriguing.4. Structure- IMS follows module system of teaching. Whole course is divided into 4 modules which will be covered in class. In each module there is a page called “Performance Monitor Scorecard” which keeps the record of all exercises given in respective chapters. Here you can keep a track on accuracy and attempts.List of resources which you will get from IMS Guwahati coaching centre· Student Copy - Module 1 to 4 (To be covered in class)· Basic Reference Material- Module 1 to 4 (To be solved at home)· Quantitative Aptitude Additional Booklets- Provided in class, comprising of Number System, Arithmetic, Algebra, Modern Maths & Geometric. On an average each booklet contains 300–350 Questions.· Workshops- This session will be held 2–3 months before CAT. These workshop will provide final push to your preparation.5. EXTRA INNINGS & BACKUP CLASSES- Once your course gets completed, Extra Innings and Back up classes will be commenced. These classes will help those students who missed certain topics in regular batch due to college/professional commitments or because of any other reasons. This will also help in revising your course once again and clear some unattended doubts.6. Encouragement for “STAY BACK STUDY”- IMS believes in optimum utilisation of time. Therefore you will be encouraged to stay back after class and study at centre itself. Thereby saving the time of commuting between home and centre. All the faculty members are usually available at the centre that means you can catch up on the problems that were left dangling in normal class sessions. You can also discuss the dilemma you are facing while preparing and get it solved spot on. Each teacher at IMS will involve with you on personal level only if you try to approach them.7. My Plan- This initiative of IMS is a boon for people like me who procrastinate their studies very often. My Plan will keep you on track. Once you join IMS Guwahati you will be allotted a Mentor who will sit with you and make a time bound study plan based on your strength and weakness. This plan will go long way in your CAT preparation journey. Your mentor will evaluate you and tell you what you are doing wrong and how to do a particular thing differently or in a more efficient way. You can book your My Plan slot in person at the centre or online at IMS website.8. IMS Online Support- It provides one of the best User Interface which is quite similar to that of CAT. IMS follows CAT Approach which means· CONCEPT: - Comprises ~3500 questions that enable you to strengthen your fundamentals across the areas of Quantitative Ability, Data Interpretation, Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension. Assess and build your conceptual clarity with the help questions that have been classified on the basis of their difficulty levels.· APPLICATION:- Comprises ~1700 questions at a CAT-level – each of the questions are based on questions that have appeared in the CAT before and therefore give you the confidence to take on any type of question in the CAT. Each of these questions/question sets can be taken as a timed test – with comparative analytics on your performance.· TESTING:- All India based SIMCATS is armed with ~5000 questions across 15 Proctored SimCATs, 25 Take-home SimCATs and 30 Section-tests.

Each of the tests is enabled by a detailed test analytics report that will not only help you identify your knowledge and skill gaps, but also give you pointers on how to improve your performance in the future. Infact IMS Guwahti is the only CAT / MAT coaching institute in Guwahatiwhich has a laboratory set up so that students can get a real feel of the tests. This makes the IMS CAT preparation in Guwahati, the best possible option for top B-school aspirants.9. CUSTODIAN OF LAST RESORT- When all support system fails, when you are feeling low or demotivated from your performance in SIMCATS, when your enthusiasm to get into dream B-School starts fading away, IMS Guwahati mentors are just a phone call away to cater to your needs. This make IMS Guwahati the best coaching centre for CAT / MAT XAT etc in Guwahati, Assam10. ADVANCE EDGE MAGAZINE- This is the most unique feature of IMS this magazine is monthly issue and provide insight of not only CAT but also about information regarding various B-School and national-international affairs. It also has sections regarding Quant, Verbal Ability and Current Affairs which will surely help to boost your preparation level.Advanc'edge MBA11. SPECIAL WORKSHOPS ON HOT ISSUES (Very Helpful for Interview) - IMS Guwahati regularly invites people from different domains for special workshops on some very sensitive topics (such as BREXIT, GST etc) which are affecting the world some way or the other. These interactive session are very helpful for second stage of admission process i.e WAT-GD-PI round. Most of the hot topics running in the news will be discussed in these sessions. You will get insight of all the current events happening around the world.Cons of joining IMS1. FACULTY OF DI-LR & VA-RC- While QA?DI faculty is best at IMS Guwahati. The faculty of Verbal must have trained at least 10000 candidates in terms of experience. DI-LR & VA-RC are the practice based sections. So the amount of effort that will go in preparation of these sections is in the ratio of 60:40 which means 60% it will be your own effort to improve in these sections and with rest 40% faculty is there for you. . Most students consider these areas as “self study” sections so faculty intervention does not matter as much as QA. This exists for every other coaching institute ‘Perfection’ is still a hypothetical concept. But that doesn’t mean that you can undermine the faculty as they will not fail you in these sections. There is always a scope of improvement both for student and the center.2. PEDANTIC ADMINSTRATION- I don’t know if this is a problem or this still exist or not, but IMS has a pedantic approach when it comes to rules such as ‘absenteeism from class’. They will call you at home and ask for reasons for not attending class on particular day.Takeaways:- If you are dedicated towards your goal and want to get in your dream B-School any coaching institute will do it for you. As I said earlier your own efforts will count the most, coaching for CAT/MAT/XAT/SNAP will just be there to guide you and bring you back from bad phase of preparation or bring you back on path if you have deviated from your goal.I cannot judge other coaching institutes as I only studied in IMS but what I heard from others is not very encouraging. IMS Guwahati has performed consistently well over the past few years. The SIMCATs of IMS is closest to that of actual CAT.But still I want to give you all a very unbiased opinion, you can consider these, but don’t take rash decision. I advice you to take trial classes in each of them and then decide what suits you the best."
CAT,How good is Indrajeet Singh's Iquanta CAT preparation coaching?,https://www.quora.com//How-good-is-Indrajeet-Singhs-Iquanta-CAT-preparation-coaching,"CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching",33,"Iquanta is possibly the biggest scam in the history of online coaching. All thanks to their so called mentor Indrajeet Singh, now no one really wants to believe the concept of Online coaching.I don’t have experience with rest of them but I can give you a first hand idea about how things work in Iquanta. After that you can judge if you’ll convert ABC or land in IBS(Not ISB).Having been associated with them for 3 years in the main group & as a student in this batch, I have seen good faculties joining Indrajeet and then leaving him because of his dirt cheap activities of firing them in greed of more money.Even this year he promised us Anuj Sinha who happens to be one of the best faculties or I should say x faculties at Iquanta during the initial demos for LRDI. And now we are standing in middle of no where with Anuj getting fired and no content in hand of last 15 classes.So if you summarize its one of those failed startups who have no good product, are in habit of duping their customers & are on verge of being shut down!The best part is when you ask for refund his team of 30 interns, few of whom have answered here to promote him would delete your posts immediately.So if you want to prepare seriously, go for something you can actually trust. And if you are well prepared of screwing up cat 17,18 and so on. Be IQUANTA’s guest.Here is an example of what he does when someone posts about his activities -One moment your post is here:Next Moment, the post is gone!Good luck!","Being a current Student of Iquanta and a member of the Facebook group CAT preparation- Iquanta , I think I am equipped to answer this question more.Now what is Iquanta and why is everyone talking about it.Iquanta is an online coaching platform which mainly focuses on MBA competitive exams like CAT, IIFT, XAT, TISS , NMAT, SNAP, etc. Its basically divided into two main Fb groups - 1) CAT preparation- Iquanta (which is a Public group for all CAT aspirants) and 2) Paid courses of Iquanta ( which are held in secret groups and sessions and are taken by expert faculties).Now who is Indrajeet Singh ?A Young boy who started his Journey from school by helping his peers and other students , is the brain behind Iquanta and CEO of Iquanta.Popularly known as the Wizard Of Quant,He is the main Quantitative aptitude Faculty Of Iquanta. He can literally solve most of the complex quant problems in a matter of seconds. He is a teacher, a mentor, an entrepreneur and most importantly a great friend.Talking from the first hand experience his sessions are the best and are very interactive. His different approaches of teaching concepts and methods are impeccable and beyond comparison.Now what makes Iquanta different from other courses in the market, here are some points:Ease of access- What differentiate Iquanta from its competitors is that classes in Iquanta takes place through secret Facebook events and groups which can be accessed anytime, anywhere and even from your mobile phones. The best part about Iquanta is that these classes takes place between 10 pm to 12 am, so not only the undergraduate students but working professionals also can easily access these classes and benefit from them.And if by chance you are not able to attend any class, Don’t worry Iquanta has got you covered as these classes stay in those events for unlimited time.Not only Videos that are being used by conventional online coachings , Iquanta also uses fb events, sessions, images and fb live events as a medium of teaching.24*7 Doubt clarification and Peer learning- Since , classes are being held on Facebook one can easily post their doubts and these doubts are answered by faculties within minutes. Most of the time these doubts are also cleared by fellow aspirants which promotes group learning and leads to multiple approaches for the same problem , saving time and effort, which is very important for an examination like CAT.Faculty- Well, one of the most crucial factors of any coaching is its faculty members because either they can make an institute or destroy it. Most of the faculty members of Iquanta are 100 percentilers themselves and some of them even have 10 years of experience in their respective fields.Every faculty member gives their best in clearing all doubts in the most simplest way possible.Indrajeet singh has its own style of teaching and has even derived his own formulas for most complex of problems which saves a lot of time on D-day.Numerous sessions and tests- Iquanta offers you from time to time various opportunities to check your preparation through various competitive mini and mock tests. These tests are not only at Par with the actual CAT but also helps in gaining that extra push that is required to nail CAT.Just for your reference I am adding - Iquanta provides 2500 plus Cat level questions with 80 sessions on quantitative aptitude, 60 sessions on Verbal ability and 60 LRDI sessions . Last Mile to CAT is usually the name of the event that is taken by faculties 15 days prior to CAT in which all past CAT questions and CAT level questions are practiced again in order to brush up concepts again and giving Iquanta students an edge over others.Moreover, I have seen no other institute that offers motivation sessions to their students from time to time, whenever they feel low or depressed. Even now after the declaration of CAT results these sessions are being conducted by Indrajeet.Affordability and Results- What makes Iquanta an ideal choice is that they are offering all of these things at a price range of Rs. 5000 to 14000 which makes it quite affordable as compared to offline coachings that costs from 50k to 60k.Students can also choose from Individual packages of Quant, Verbal ability and LRDI according to their need which costs around 5000 each.Now here comes the most Important factor, that is the Result record of Iquanta :Following its past records this year also, Iquanta has proved itselfCAT 17 - 100 97+ percentilers and 40 99+ percentilers.I, Understand it depends from person to person and on one’s preparation level but I have actually seen people going from being 60 or 70 percentilers to 90 percentilers after joining Iquanta . I would highly recommend to join these courses as soon as possible in order to get the most out of it.For further information- CAT Preparation - IQuantaI hope this helps you all in making the right decision, All the Best!!","REALLY GOOD, No doubt in it.I have been hearing a lot of buzz lately among all the new online coaching start ups and so I finally decided to write down hoping it might help a few. I have had the experience of Iquanta and I have to say its the one stop solution for anyone aspiring a great score! I will state the reasons below.Indrajeet Singh The very first reason is him. Yes, he is more of a support, guide and a friend than a teacher. The best part is he’s 24*7 there for all his students in case of any doubt or help.Quality : You will come to know about his tips and tricks which are designed by him and not copied plainly from elsewhere. The way he teaches and relates the concept so something that we can remember is commendable.Facebook Events : I have to say this is the most effective way of studying in a group that I have discovered. No noise, no disturbance, no unwanted notifications and a bunch of people as enthusiastic and energetic as you.SO AFFORDABLE : This is pretty self explanatory. What else does one need? This was my personal say above but you can find some links which can be more useful to you in case you want to know some more facts. Also, would like to mention that there were 100 IIM converts in CAT15, 17 99.6+ percentilers and two 100 percentiler in Cat 2015. Succes stories of iQuanta students: Online CAT Exam Preparation PlatformiQuanta Course Details : Online CAT Exam Preparation PlatformHope this helps! Thank you :)","Undoubtedly iQuanta is the best online coaching institute for CAT preparation because of its different methodology. There are many points with which you can distinguish iQuanta from other coaching institutes:iQuanta has its classes spanning from 10pm-12am, the time when everyone can sit without any other botheration to attend classes. There is no point of disturbance from your college, job or any other pursuit at this particular span of time.iQuanta holds its classes in a secret group of facebook in the form of events. If due to some personal issue you miss classes then you can attend it later through past events.iQuanta faculty is available 24*7 to clear your doubts. You don’t have to ever wait to reach out for your doubts, you can ping them anytime, which off course enhances the efficiency of your learning.It has the best faculty in all courses but has the best of the best in QA. Indrajeet Sir with his simple tricks and easy to imbibe methods simplifies the look of a problem which seems unapproachable at first. It has its mock session which even lets you judge your potentiality in the topic and how much u need to work at it. People who find maths as their basic weakness need to work essentially at it and iQuanta makes the struggle easy.iQuanta is a platform in which you get to learn with people who are highly passionate for CAT. You even get to learn tricks and shortcut methods from them. They are the most talented mass to compete with in order to judge your potential.The last and the most important thing for many is the affordability of such a program. When other institutes cut your pocket by INR 40–60k ,iQuanta charges a very minimal fee which ranges between INR 4-11k (approx) depending upon the course that you want to go for. It offers diversity in its learning by giving you room to select or go for the course in which you think you need guidance. No other coaching institute allows us that much space.For other details you can visit its website I-quanta"

This course will help you access any topic anytime and anywhere,hence, providing the freedom of learning as per your need and pace of understanding.Basic Plan:Try to finish the syllabus within October. Devote 3–4 hours per section every day or as per your strengths and weaknesses (i.e., practice the harder ones so that even if you miss practicing the easier ones you can cover it up by taking mocks later).Next take 20 mocks at least. Mocks are the heart of CAT preparation, they help in analyzing your strengths and weaknesses and practice accordingly.For actual CAT level mocks refer “Handa Ka Funda” mock test series.Tips:Solve 5 DI questions and 3–4 RC passages every day. Keep taking sectional mocks daily until you attain the confidence with respect to each section.Spend at least 4 hours for preparation even if you are occupied for the day.Make notes along with practicing questions daily. Any sort of idea or new shortcut should be part of these notes.A quick revision in the early morning of the previous day preparation. This works wonders!Remember self-discipline, dedication, and determination for 60 days can give you more than 6000 days of encouraging life.Above all the things do not let go the fear in you.

Grammar and usageReading is important but your ability to Summarize correctly after you read an article/passage is also very vital. Work on this ability and I am sure you will be able to improve your CAT scores in this section.(Remember understanding a passage correctly is more important than reading it faster). Catking has come up with an excellent Verbal Maximizer Course which consist of 500 questions covering entire verbal syllabus with recorded solutions along with 50 Test sets.Ability in Maths is one of the most important in management entrance tests. If one considers Data Interpretation as part of maths, then the quantitative portion is 2/3rd of the paper. People who are weak in maths need not fear since a logical approach will help clear this section quite easily. Topics like number systems, percentages, profit and loss, time and distance, must be thoroughly done. A large part of the paper has algebra too, so the student must have complete knowledge of quadratic equations, functions, logs and the like.Questions on geometry and co-ordinate geometry are also asked. Hence a strategic approach towards such topics is necessary which can be taught only by the one who is experienced. Faculty at Catking are not only experienced but also Toppers of their field.

However, that does not mean one should wait till then.   If you have more time at your disposal, it would be better to start preparing right away.  So, let's take it on a phase-by-phase basis.Phase I.   Utilize time to chalk out a preparation strategy for maximum efficiency and to improve your vocabulary and general awareness (both of which cannot be done as part of a crash course)1. Analyze your strengths and weaknesses Do numbers scare you? Has probability always been a foe? Are the RC passages long and boring and put you to sleep? What about your reading speed? Is it 100 wpm or 200? Is it enough? Do words like factitious and proclivity confuse you?  Then start to work on them.2. Start reading The best way to build a vocabulary and a critical mindset which will come handy while attempting the Verbal and RC section of the examination is by reading. Read anything - books, novels, newspapers, magazines, blog posts, other online articles etc.  This will also help you to increase your reading speed (anything below 300 wpm will be a deterrent) and also to focus in case the topics in the examination are dry (for example, History, Politics etc)  Set a reading target. Also, have a target list ready.  A good place to begin will be the BBC list of Top 100 Books. A book a week would enable you to finish all 100 in less than 2 years.3. Start working on your problem solving abilities Start reading through brain-teasers. Solve logical problems. Start exercising your brain cells to boost your IQ. This exercise will be useful not only for the examination but also for your life in general.4. Extra focus on vocabulary Building a good vocabulary is a tedious exercise; one that requires a tremendous amount of patience and persistence. Thankfully, there are many tools and hacks to help you with it - word maps, flash cards etc. These visual aids always help.Phase II.  Now would be a good time to join a coaching class and start working with a schedule and deadlines ready.  Many people ask if coaching is mandatory and if you can crack the exam without it. The answer is NO; it is definitely not mandatory, however, it would be helpful because of the following reasons: Discipline: Procrastination is something everyone encounters in case of assignments with long deadlines. The same is the case here. Unless you commit to a classroom schedule, people generally tend to put it off for future. Having classes and having paid for all of them in advance ensures that you attend them, at the very least, listen to the instructor and soak in the very basic concepts.Competition and bench-marking: The classes give you a glimpse of the competition you are going to face moving forward. You would find people who come prepared for every class, listen intently to everything being said and take down meticulous notes. The same motivates you to also start working your ass off.Faculty: These guys who are going to teach you have years of experience. They are fairly familiar with the exam pattern, the types of questions that are asked and tricks to solve them in the shortest time possible.Ensure that you attend all classes and are at par with everyone else. Take out time to revisit the concepts once after the class. Trust me, it makes a lot of difference to how much of the same is retained by you.  Phase III:  This is the most important phase. Time to finally put everything you have learnt to test. Every coaching center has their own test series where you can give any no. of mock tests and you are given a percentile score to benchmark you against your peers.   A few pointers:· Aim to complete 2 mock tests per week i.e. 16 - 20 in 2 months. This will give you ample time to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses and to fine tune your strategy· Every mock test result should be analyzed and monitored to ensure that you are making clear progress with every subsequent attempt· Apart from mock tests, there are sectional tests. If after, say 5 tests, you realize that you are weak in one particular area, head over to that section and practice away. Sectional tests are around 10-20 questions for about 30 minutes each.Phase IV : A few (10-12) days before the exam  You should ideally relax for a week before the exam.1. Just read a couple of daily newspapers and avoid reading anything else so as not to cluster your mind with unnecessary information.2. Preferably pick up a book you have already read and one that you immensely adore. Re-read it.3. Listen to music.4. Talk to friends.5. Go to a good movie.6. Avoid the temptation to attempt ""one last"" mock test. At any cost. (If, by ill fate or due to nervousness, the outcome is not good, it might deeply hamper your performance in the actual exam)7. Do anything you like - if you are a painter, paint; if you are a guitarist, practice; but the most important part, take a good power nap. It will help you to relax, and will make you more productive.Cheers!","Start with confidence, whether you begin by yourself or join a coaching. Now what is this confidence that I am talking about? - CAT is an aptitude test - you have the inherent aptitude - all you need is brushing up. CAT prep is like getting ready for the big event, the skill already lies inside you. This is the CAT confidence!Now, how to plan:1.BASIC MODULE: Till 15th Septembera.Complete the basics of all the major topics once. <In class, through examples etc. Etc. Solving 10-15 questions from each chapter just to make sure that you are conceptually there should be enough>b.Read newspaper editorial for at least 30 days. Read 3-4 good novels at least – preferably authors like Ayn Rand, Robin Sharma etc. Who focus on philosophy or motivation themes.c.Appear for 2-3 full mocks just to build these four thingsi.Exam temperamentii.Accuracyiii.Selectioniv.Speed2. ADVANCED MODULE: 15th September to 15th Octobera.Focus on the CAT important topics at an advanced level (Those 10 chapters which will give you 60+ questions in CAT). Solve these topics from 1. Your advanced sheets/books 2. Your topic test module (online/offline) – do give tests to make sure that you build practice on speed as well. During the test focus on speed maximization. At the end of the test, try to solve/read solutions/clear doubts of all questions that you got wrong. Also focus on those that you could not solve. Check your mistakes/selection. Question your judgement in attempting and try to understand the pattern of your mistakes in solving/selection. Make sure you don’t repeat these mistakes in the coming tests.i.Chapter 1: Reading Comprehensionii.Chapter 2: Para jumbles/completion/summarizationiii.Chapter 3: Time, Speed, Distance, Workiv.Chapter 4: Percentage, Solution mixtures, Profit and Lossv.Chapter 5: DI Pie-Line Charts and Tabular DI. Connecting/linked tables - up to 3.vi.Chapter 6: Grouping, selection, team/matrix formation,tournaments and set theory - up to 4 sets.vii.Chapter 7: Geometry and Mensurationviii.Chapter 8: Quadratic equation/inequality and maxima minimaix.Chapter 9: Factors, remainders and divisibilityx.Chapter 10: Arrangements(Linear/Circular) and ordering/ sequencingb.For all other chapters, if time doesn’t permit – just solve 10-15 advanced questions each chapter from your books and revise it once more before CAT. It is not necessary to do tests on every topic as time won’t be enough to do it all.FULL MOCKS: Do give at least 4 full mocks this month3. Final lap: 16th October to 25th November: THE TRIMURTI FORMULA – your standard week!a.50 days left to CAT: I recommend following a STANDARD SCHEDULE now.i.TIRMURTI DAY 1: 16th Oct: Give a mock CATii.TRIMURTI DAY 1-2: 16-17th Oct: Analyze the paper after the exam at three levels1.Solve each unsolved question and understand the solution. See if you could have done it in the exam in given time and analyze whether your decision to not attempt it in the exam was right or wrong.2.Solve each wrongly attempted question and ensure that you learn from your mistake so that it doesn’t get repeated in the next exam. Wrong attempts should seriously be catered to else they become your enemies in the exams to come.3.Read the solution to the questions you got right and see if there exists a shorter solution or not!iii.TRIMURTI DAY 3: 18th Oct: Revise/Practice any topic that you think is letting you down in mocks.iv.19-20-21st Oct: Repeat the 3 day TRIMURTI pattern but this time on a previous year CAT paper.v.22nd Oct: Take a break – have fun, listen to English music and read a good novel. <This is the seventh day. So every week has 1 full mock, 1 previous year paper, analysis and revision followed by a one day break>​4.THE LAST WEEK: 26th November to 3rd Decembera.26-29th Nov: Read all the concepts that you have learnt till now. Keep making notes. Make a small TOOL BOOK/ Concept Summary of your class/coaching notes or study till now.b.1-3 October: Read CAT relevant articles – Philosophy, Psychology and Socioeconomic/Culture based articles from Wikipedia.THE KEY IS: Work, improve, check your progress and improvement.Also remember, balance your thought process properly. As you cover more and more syllabus, grow in confidence. Confidence that I can select and solve questions in the exam is the key to happy CATting! Remember, start your day with a laughter! Dive into every day with energy. Work smart, sharp and hard each day. End your day with a big smile and in a hope of reliving the laughter moment the next morning.Create strong support systems. Cut down on time extravagance and be with people who can help you perform better by understanding your exam preferences and sincerity.The article has been taken from my institute blog: Source(How to crack CAT in 4 months? by Rahul Anand Sir(alum, IIM A; Director, B-Factory))Best of luck!Rahul Sir","This the same answer I gave to a different question. But well, the questions are similar as well.Let me burst some myths first if possible.Reading newspapers in NOT sufficient or necessary for Verbal Ability preparation. I got through without reading newspaper, though I had to read it in preparation for interviews.Theoretical books DON’T help you clear Quant or LRDI. All you need from the books is practice.The so-called shortcuts do not help everyone. For example, I never do multiplication using the ‘vedic multiplication techniques’. But, put me in a contest with anyone who does that and I will always win. Only because I practiced a lot and the usual method works for me better.There is no set method to solve any kind of question. If there was, everyone would be able to answer that question. The ones who prepare the exam want people who can think. Not people who prepare.Self-preparation? I am sorry to say this, but it doesn’t work like that. Very few, probably 20–30 out of 2 lakh can do that. No one is that good. You need to get inputs from others regularly. There are a lot of things that you wouldn’t know if you study on your own.CAT is not enough! Don’t make it your sole aim to get through CAT. Interviews which come after CAT are equally, if not more, important.Now, Let’s see a general outline to improve yourself till the exam.Start writing Mocks immediately. I consider them the most important part of preparation. I took so many mocks that I felt the CAT exam as another mock. That removed a lot of pressure.Mocks give you an idea where you stand. Take it up from there. Analysis each mock you write for probably half an hour. You would know your strong and weak areas from 3–4 mocks.For verbal, reading is very important. But, rather than reading, the way you read it more important. Newspaper doesn’t help much because the style of writing is factual. There are different styles of writing and you need to be aware of all. So, read different books. There are going to be around 6 passages. These will from the domains of philosophical, historical, scientific, fictitious and reporting. Most important -’You cannot spend more than 5 minutes on any passage.’ Basically, you have to glance through the passage after reading the first paragraph in detail. You need to spend atleast 2 minutes on each question in the passage. Don’t just answer. Read the question thoroughly. I got 95 percentile in Verbal in 2015. 99.91 in 2016. Why? This was the change I adopted.Practice a lot for Quant and DILR. But, don’t ever just practice. If it was that easy, every who can do hard-work will get through. Develop your thinking abilities. Try to devise atleast 2 ways of solving every single problem. Especially for quant, try to look at the way in which you can solve the problem without using pen, paper or calculator. To develop your calculating abilities, whenever you are free to do this - Take two 3-digit numbers at random and try to multiply them in your mind. Then, check it by hand. This will help you in DILR. Look at which method works for you the best.Last but not the least, let me recommend two things for you-Try as much as possible to limit your rough work. You are not guaranteed to get more than two rough sheets in the exam. I recommend using 2 sides for DILR, 1 and half side for Quant and half if required for verbal.I recommend not using calculator for quants. I assure you from the experience of atleast 50 mocks from TIME and 2 actual CAT exams that using the onscreen calculator for quants just wastes time.Hope I was helpful.You can also follow my Blog for regular updates on preparation.cat2017prep.blogspot.in"

You can register yourself here www.catking.in for free demo lecture.Books and materialFirst of all, get CAT preparation material of some good coaching institute. You can buy Catking books which are apt and more than sufficient for CAT preparation.For verbal, you also need to read “Word Power made Easy” by Norman Lewis. It is a very good book which helps in increasing vocabulary not by memorising stuff, but by understanding the ideas behind the words. It is distributed into 45-47 sessions meant to be read one at a time. It is a must-read book and should be completed within two months of starting your preparation.Test SeriesThis is like the Holy Grail of CAT preparation. Subscribe to one good Test Series and write all the tests very sincerely in simulated environment. Fix a day, say Sunday, fix a time, say 9 AM, and give the test every week at the same time. Sit in proper position while attempting the test and tell all your roommates or family members not to disturb you at that time.Once you write 15-20 such tests, CAT will no longer be a stranger to you. When you will sit for actual CAT, you will feel as if you have done this a lot of times and it will help you to remain confident during the exam. You can buy Catking Mock Series consist of Basic and Advance level CAT questions.To improve in the Verbal section your need to have a grasp on the following:1. Reading and comprehending ability: Comprehension is more important than speed of reading2. Reasoning Skills: Improve your critical reasoning skills. This will not only help your solve the verbal reasoning questions but also the Reading Comprehensions questions3. Grammar and usageReading is important but your ability to Summarize correctly after you read an article/passage is also very vital. Work on this ability and I am sure you will be able to improve your CAT scores in this section.(Remember understanding a passage correctly is more important than reading it faster). Catking has come up with an excellent Verbal Maximizer Course which consist of 500 questions covering entire verbal syllabus with recorded solutions along with 50 Test sets.Ability in Maths is one of the most important in management entrance tests. If one considers Data Interpretation as part of maths, then the quantitative portion is 2/3rd of the paper. People who are weak in maths need not fear since a logical approach will help clear this section quite easily.

This will help you in deciding whether you need individual subjects like VARC or DILR or the package of all the subjects.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC)In my opinion Reading Comprehension (RC) comprises of 24% of the question paper, so you must ace RC. For this, you can opt for Wordpandit’s Ultimate RC course, which has the wide range of plans and variety with super talented support faculty. It gives you the detailed video of RC, grammar, and verbal ability along with facebook lives sessions and WhatsApp support. And the most beautiful part of this course is its Daily Reads followed by doubt clearing session, which expose you to diverse and intense reading required for CAT.Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI&LR) and Quantitative Aptitude (QA)DILR has been the Achilles heel for most of the CAT aspirants, while QA has been on the easier side for last 2–3 years. For these two subjects, you can go with CL’ s online classes. It has a team of prolific faculties like Gautam Puri and Gijo, who are one of the best in their respective field. Basically, this package provides assistance with all the subjects including VARC, but while preparing I felt Wordpandit for VARC has an edge.Mock test seriesFor mock CAT you can choose either CL or IMS, but I felt CL’s mock was closer to the actual CAT and its test analysis provide great insights, which actually helps tremendously in preparing the right strategy for taking CAT.Hope this will help.Good Luck for CAT- 2018.For CAT 2017 question paper: https://www.handakafunda.com/wp-...https://www.handakafunda.com/wp-...Wordpandit RC course: https://learn.wordpandit.com/?re...CL’s CAT Cracker: Smart CAT Cracker- CAT Online prep, CAT elearning","As my bio says, I work for 2iim.There is NO one best Coaching institute for CAT preparation (I still believe 2iim is the best out there, which is a discussion for another day).Each institute has a different pricing strategy, different set of teachers, Pedagogy, varied content and delivery methods. Considering all the aforementioned factors, adding to your comfortable price point, your expectations from a CAT course, to each his/her own best CAT course.2IIM started off with testimonials on our website (Reviews). All reviews are original, as is copy pasted from the emails that we have received from aspirants. When people started doubting the credibility of self proclaimed reviews, we started off reviews on neutral websites like Quora. (Quora reviews). If I saw all these a year ago, I would have accepted these to be genuine and trusted the course. However someone is very Naive if we trust these to date. It's now a generation of cyber bullying and cyber maligning. Any course review that has less than 40 reviews should be scrutinized well. CAT prep companies have learnt to game the system well. By posting good quality created content from several id's. Any course review that has extremely positive or negative reviews are to be taken with personal discretion. Proof of pudding is in the eating!Try a course. Try all the courses you want to try(if the provider lets you try).Do not let others influence your decision. Things to check: Check the price, check the method of delivery, continuous internet access required? downloadable content? cross platform access available? am i comfortable with the delivery provided by this teacher? and other sensible questions to consider. There is no one right or wrong answer. For instance, if you are from a tier 1 city with a fibernet connection, The question of downloadable content is of no purpose to you.Try preparing a comparative checklist of all that's available from an online course. We at 2IIM let anyone try upto 20% of the course for free. Forever. Any number of times. We don't have a refund policy. Try before you buy!!","The Common Admission Test scores are very crucial in determining the faith of management aspirants in India. A common question that arises in the minds of MBA aspirants is, “How to crack CAT?” When you have spent an entire year preparing for the entrance, you are determined to do anything that will give you a 99 percentile score. The following steps will assist you in achieving a good percentile-To achieve the score, you need to strategize your preparation from Day 1 itself. Understand the pattern first, identify your weak and strong areas. While doing the basics, target your weakness very well, so that you are able to solve most of the question of topic given to you. After basics the most important part comes, the Mock tests, they are the real testing waters. You will make mistakes in time bound mocks taken in actual exam conditions. You should dedicate last 3 months specifically to mock tests and analysis of every single mistake you make. If you do this thoroughly, there is high probability that you will land up near perfect score.In case you want to join any coaching Institute, I will suggest you to join KITABEE , It has maximum students clearing CAT exam in terms of Percentage. Very qualified faculty. FEES is also very LESS.For verbal………Reading everything and anything will make you clear the RC's. Just don't be biased towards sports in newspapers as I am and you will do well. Another important thing. Learn to read online. CAT is not a paper based test. Try and find blogs and articles that will test your vocab and understanding in ways unprecedented. If you're serious, people might have already suggested the HINDU and the Financial Express(or the Economic times). Well, I have the same suggestion though I never followed it. Develop a liking towards reading and it will help you in your gdpi stages. If you're not a GEM, you might get a call or two as well. On a more serious note. Read online and if possible, start a blog.Write. Share it with just a couple of people if you're scared of showing your pathetic writing skills to the world. Ask them to point out your grammatical mistakes. Try and not repeat the same mistakes in the future. As you read more, the mistakes you make will lessen.For any aspirant, the following factors are of prime importance when it comes to joining a coaching institute:1. Personal[math]Personal[/math] attention[math]attention[/math] - I think the most important factor is this. If personal attention and mentoring is missing, don't join. When you are evaluating institutes, go and check their classrooms for batch size. Ask for a demo session, if possible. Go and take a demo class you will realize why i am suggesting KITABEE.2.Faculty[math]Faculty[/math] - In addition to point 1, look for faculties who have gone through the whole process as they can understand you better and guide you better. Ask for faculty details. See if you can talk to them. According to me “Neeraj[math]Neeraj[/math] sir[math]sir[/math]” is the best teacher just call him and ask any doubt if you have. 7838804491[math]7838804491[/math], 9718375475, 9540897459.3. Content/Material/mocks[math]Content/Material/mocks[/math] -At KITABEE content is getting frequently updated to match the recent trends. As I said, not a differentiating factor. Mocks used to be a differentiating factor, go and visit Kitabee Site.In KITABEE you will get ample of materials to practise. There will be regular classes and after the completion of the class you will be given handouts which will comprise of the same thing taught in class . You should manage your time so well that you should practise every material. The study material are designed in such a way that it matches with CAT level. Believe me if you just do the study material religiously you will surely score more than 90 percentile. Besides that you will be given sectional tests which will be little advanced . And then comes the NEERAJ SIR’S AIMCAT.Clearing your doubts is another important thing to follow every time.What initially struck me about KITABEE is the Modular Approach they follow. It is very flexible and allows you to repeat topics any number of times.AS THE BATCH IS VERY VERY LESS, SO IT'S LIKE PERSONAL COACHING.Kitabee focuses even on other exams like IIFT, SNAP, NMAT, XAT etc and regular mocks and revision sessions help the students perform better in these exams as each and every exam is a different ball game and needs a different strategy to excel.As the number of students is less there is a personal bond between the students and the mentors and this makes the faculty members very much approachable. Neraj Sir and Pratik Sir are a constant source of motivation for the students and help them work harder and harder.This pic was uploaded by Kitabee on Facebook …KITABEE WILL HELP YOU IN ANALYZING ……….What are your areas of strength? For Example, Quant is your area of strength. Jolly Good!! Which subjects do you excel in Quant. Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry ?? Make sure you score cent percent in them. What are your areas of weakness?? Probability. Make sure you learn the basics to exploit the low hanging fruits.What are your areas of weakness? For example, VA (verbal ability). Which parts do you score in VA. Synonyms/Antonyms, Paragraph reading, Sentence corrections. Awesome!! Concentrate only on these areas and make sure this is enough to cross the line.Enroll for a test package.Give each test as if it the d-day. Determine time allocations as per your comfort. I generally follow 30–30–30–10 rule. 30% of time per each section to cross the line and final 10% of time to maximize my score.Your preparation doesn't end here. It starts now. After each test, go through each answer diligently. This helps you evaluate your strengths and weakness.For example, you fumbled with Data sets. Great!! Go back to basics. Read and solve everything you can lay hand on for the next one week. Your aim for the next test should be zero mistakes in Data sets.On a normal basis, your All India percentile in these tests is more or less your upcoming CAT score unless you somehow achieve super powers on the D-day and perform exceedingly well.Believe in yourSELF AND IN KITABEE ……!Aren’t you convinced yet. Well, that’s how I made it during my CAT being an average student, from an average college.And its a separate ball game altogether, if you are talking about GDPI.All the best!! Work smart, bell the CAT!!RegardsRahul"
CAT,"Which coaching is best for CAT in Delhi: Time, Tathagat (cp) or CL?",https://www.quora.com//Which-coaching-is-best-for-CAT-in-Delhi-Time-Tathagat-cp-or-CL,"Exams and Tests in New Delhi, CAT Coaching, Test Preparation and Coaching in New Delhi, Coaching Exams and Tests, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching, New Delhi, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests",22,"To begin with, CAT basically tests a candidate on English and Maths, subjects which we study for around 15 years of our lives. If one is motivated enough, one can easily cross the 80-90 percentile barrier depending on their clarity of concepts.The coaching institutes will only benefit a person, if one is willing to put in the labour.Now coming to the institutes, TIME and CL have been in the game for too long and they have batches starting almost every week. They also have a number of teachers teaching the same subjects, so you cannot really experience which faculty is the best. Then TIME also has elite batches wherein only students from top colleges are admitted. Generally, the 100 percentilers are from the elite batches.Then there are the new entrants like Tathagat and MBAguru. From what I have heard is that Tathagat’s English faculty is better. Both of these institutes understand that quora is a medium people want their answers from and as a result they have their people writing praise for themselves on quora.Simply put, these institutes are out there to your money which amount to around ₹45–50k. They have receptionists calling themselves as counsellors who would probably influence your minds so as to believe that theirs is the best institute out there.Most of the people joining these institutes are people who are directionless after having finished their graduation and think that MBA would bring prosperity in their lives.To summarise it, if you are motivated enough and are willing to put in the labour, you can study yourselves and then later enrol for their mock tests.However, if you are directionless and just want to get an MBA, join either of these institutes. There's going to be no spoon feeding even after you pay a hefty sum. The teachers would continue to teach at their pace so as to cover all the topics before your exams notwithstanding whether or not you are able to understand things in class.I don't know if I could help with this answer. I can continue to write about how everything is wrong with these institutes but then that isn't going to help either. So, if you are motivated enough and are sure of why you want an MBA enrol for any of these institutes, it wouldn't matter much.","I am writing both - the procs and cons of joining TGPro - In TG, English faculty, Mr Kumar, is like everything you have got. Teaching under him, is like a gift that God has somehow bestowed to you. He is, no doubt, is the best faculty ever in Delhi and legend of this era. Having had word him, if you speak to any other faculty somewhere else, then only you can substantiate and realize how substandard other might have. Other is Mr Kamal for Quant, he is again genius. For Quant yo may perhaps find other good faculty in other institutes, but his humbleness and availability for doubts shall engross you. He is brilliant Mathematician but you need to chase his pace. Concept of workshops here in TG is their USP. It's like, do some self study at home and miss normal classes, but having attend the workshop you can cope with what you have missed out.Cons - They don't give, even a slightest of bit, to complete the course timely. Irrespective of either you join in Jan/Feb or June, they shall reach the post by CAT time only. They never work out strategies to get the course done by stipulated timelines. Lack of Management - You wont have ID cards till their test series, no intimation for abrupt change in the class timing, mode of communication is FB - severest flaw that they have. They claim back ups, sure you shall get but it till July only. After that what they do is, they club up the two batched to cover up the course speedily; in this case its clear there wont be any space in classroom, thereby no back. Test Series is not up to mark. You need to go for someones's else. But don't keep this as the limiting factor. To recapitulate, you need to make settlement with cons, if you can, then only join TG. One Axiom - If you are in love with language, even an iota of it, listening to Mr Kumar is life long experience.  ","It was in my Btech 6th sem when I was searching for an MBA institute where I could start my CAT preparation. My Phone was flooded by calls from all the BRANDS and standard names CAREER LAUNCHER, TIME etc. I was so damn confused as someone was offering scholarships, some were sharing their past success records wherever possible (Mails, on Call, Messages , Whatsapp etc.)Suddenly one day my cousin called up and said bro why don’t you try that institute on Barakhamba road , he dint know the name of institute , all he arranged for me is a number of his friend who attended the institute and an adjective for the faculty (Wahan pe English ke Choti wale sir hain bhai bahut faadpadhate hain ) .This is all I knew about Tathagat until I went to the place and learnt more about totalgadha group and of course all the faculties.I planned to join the institute just on the basis of this word to mouth publicity and marketing being done by the students of TATHAGAT and then somebody just came to me and said “bhai dande se padhna hai to TathaGat join krle or agar khud hi bahut ache se padhai kr skta hai to koi bhi institute kyun join krna hai” and I realized the kind of person I am ( as I lack concentration , not very disciplined in my study schedules , a large social circle etc.) this institute can actually make me study either by choice or by force.Next weekend onwards I was a TGITE, from the very first day I could see the fear psychosis of not being allowed to attend the sessions with incomplete work started working for me, I never read any books and novels but yes KUMAR SIR (the so called English wale sir) made everybody read at least one novel/book a week. Even I used to finish my weekly tasks, which helped me to be in touch with the syllabus everyday rather than just attending a weekly session and then books closed till next session.Now the preparation was not maths and English , infcat it was broken into modules which are actually needed to be learnt and practiced (Quant , RC, SC ) . In my case I have this childhood fear with mathematics , I have never been able to score in mathematics , but here I actually improved on my question tackling techniques rather than mathematics , I won’t say my maths improved miraculously or anything superlative rather I just learnt to handle many problems of mathematics by simple logic rather than formulas and calculations.Sessions with KUMAR Sir were most absorbing , those sessions were not just about SC or RC or a particular topic rather the sessions were a pool of abundant knowledge share and transfer, he used to talk about history , biology , music , science and almost everything , those sessions could be never ending if one actually wants to sit and listen. In the later part of the sessions TG used to organize practice and revision workshops and trust me those workshops are more than worth , this is the platform that even if you have not given your 100% and you feel your preparation is not upto the mark , these workshops are just wonderful you can cover up the whole Course and practice everything just double up your efforts during these workshops and you will be through.For those looking forward for joining an MBA preparation Institute I would suggest Tathagat will give you a real and honest platform where you can learn and improve upon your aptitude and overall personality which you may or may not learn in your graduation school.","Tathagat was a waste of money (Rs. 61,000) and time(2 months). they give decent teachers for first 15 days which is their refund period and then the people who teach from there on are not up to the mark.Verbal teachers are decent though the atmosphere in the class is usually depressing (Mr. Kumar who is their GOD is just an overrated teacher who lost his touch many years ago ad also thinks “Rousseau and Darwin befkoof hai salle” ). Don't even consider going there for quant., all the teachers are below average. Out of 4 teachers for quant., only 1 was willing to teach and clearing doubts (he also happen to teach only in the first 15 days) and the case was pretty similar for verbal as well.The administration doesn’t know how to behave, they are extremely rude and need some classes on basic civic behaviour. I was asked to “shut up and get out” for asking for a refund due to some financial constraint and unsatisfactory services (since it’s a business)My experience was simply writing down stuff from the board with practically no discussion in the class. Other than this the place is located in a very shady place, and the suffocating classrooms often have tiny mice running around.Also, this is very funny but turns out most of the good reviews about them online are given by themselves or by students to avail discount (great marketing trick though)"
CAT,Is BYJU coaching for the CAT good or is another institute better?,https://www.quora.com//Is-BYJU-coaching-for-the-CAT-good-or-is-another-institute-better,"BYJU'S (company), CAT Coaching, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching",5,"I will definitely mention that Byju's has a upper hand when it comes to CAT coaching.

Their material is full of shortcut techniques and strategies for which our trainers are known. Byju Raveendran who takes care of QA DI & LR has himself topped the exam twice! that says it all . CAT requires qualitative, not quantitative preparation and I can confidently say that Byju's provide the most advanced level of CAT preparation in India. Byju's tablet program is definitely worth it.From engaging video lessons to one-on-one mentoring, adaptive learning to visualizing, Byju's tablet offers everything...Application of unique shortcut techniques makes the problems easy to solve. It focuses on concepts rather than rote memorization. you get everything in one place.

Most of the positivity about Byju’s tends to be from employees of theirs who are filling Quora with copy-pasted answers. Of course, your mileage may vary.Some of the common criticisms I’ve heard of Byju’s are the cost, the fact that videos cannot be watched more than thrice, and the overall ineffectiveness of the teachers to communicate well.At ExamVictor, we have tried to fix this. What we’ve done is go through the major CAT coaching programs in India, examine their flaws and put together something that will excel all-round.Why do I feel ExamVictor’s Online CAT Coaching Program is better?1. I have made the video content myself. It is the course I wish I had when I was preparing for CAT. Which brings me to my next point…2. I actually cracked CAT. I don’t claim to be a ‘serial CAT topper’ or some such, I actually have a degree from IIMA. I’d like to think this gives me an insight into what the modern CAT is testing in students.3. Plenty of support - we conduct Live Doubt Sessions for CAT, and we also have 24-hour email doubt support.4. Plenty of practice material - 1000s of questions, carefully arranged and sorted, with answers, so that you know you are practicing actual CAT-standard questions.I really think we’ve done a fabulous job putting together a course that I would be happy to study from. Do give us a try, and all the best!","I would say the Byju's classes is one of the best coaching institutes for CAT Preparation!From my prior experience once you join the Byju's classes, you won't need any reference book. Go for their tablet program, it is too good. From my personal experience, i had joined Byju's just 3 months before my entrance and it paid off really well. They have the best faculty who take care of all the sections -- be it difficult quant section or tricky logical reasoning. You get pre loaded videos for which you don't need an internet connection. You get all the study material and test modules in one place. The best part is you get to decide when to attend the classes as per your convenience. You are taught such amazing short cut techniques which helps you to solve the difficult questions easily. Also with their modules, you can predict the questions for the exam. In my case, i always used to mug up the formulae, but with Shantanu sir and Pravin sir's fantastic techniques i could solve them easily, specially the speed-time-distance questions.For me Byju's classes really helped, i cracked IIM Raipur, and i am so proud of it!! It wasn't only my hardwork and determination, but also the manner i was guided and taught.","I attended Byju's classes in Bangalore , 2 month weekend crash course in the year 2010. . The classroom sessions seemed impactful to me and my friends,other friends of mine attended video sessions too in other cities .. I got shortlists from IIMB, IIMI and SpJain .. Converted IIMI with the help of GDPI-Essay sessions from Byjus.. I personally feel Byju's teaching methods are very good . The way of teaching is very different and easy. It is more about basic Maths  than cramming formulas  .. I recommended Byjus for couple of my friends recently .. Now, Bujys  have videos loaded in tablets as well to facilitate revision for students .. In 2010, Byju's used to offer free open sessions to help you take a decision to join . This is a good option to try .."

CAT,Which online coaching institute is best for CAT Preparation?,https://www.quora.com//Which-online-coaching-institute-is-best-for-CAT-Preparation,"CAT (Common Admission Test) 2016, CAT Coaching, Coaching Exams and Tests, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Coaching, Website Recommendations, Exams and Tests",100+,"""Many great things can be done in a day IF you don’t always make that day tomorrow""A common question troubling MBA aspirants is when to commence with CAT preparation and the answer is NOWAs mentioned by many, CAT (Common Admission Test) is one of the toughest exam to crack. It is the gateway to getting into prestigious IIMs and other top B-schools of India. So the very first thing that you should do is:Understand the syllabusThis is a useful tip for almost any exam. Understand the syllabus by going through past year’s papers and official guidelines. All the information about CAT/XAT/NMAT/TISS/MICA/SNAP/CMAT/CET are available on our website www.catking.in .CAT can be segmented into four broad parts-Quantitative AbilityData InterpretationLogical ReasoningVerbal AbilityStart your preparation with sheer determination.Know where you standA lot of successful IIM aspirants attribute their success to the efforts put in the last 4-6 months before the CAT. Take the Basic Mock test at Catking to know where you stand. This can then be used as a base to start your preparation for this year.Should you join coaching?This is based on a lot of things. If you have a lot of time, you can go for coaching. However, if you are into a hectic job and get very little time to study, you can prepare on your own or you can join online classes. Although Coaching will give you proper guidance on what to prepare, major areas to focus on, strategies to save time and also help in preparing for Group Discussions and Personal Interview. Catking is one of the best Cat classes in Mumbai and Pune. You can register yourself here www.catking.in for free demo lecture.Books and materialFirst of all, get CAT preparation material of some good coaching institute. You can buy Catking books which are apt and more than sufficient for CAT preparation.For verbal, you also need to read “Word Power made Easy” by Norman Lewis. It is a very good book which helps in increasing vocabulary not by memorising stuff, but by understanding the ideas behind the words. It is distributed into 45-47 sessions meant to be read one at a time. It is a must-read book and should be completed within two months of starting your preparation.Test SeriesThis is like the Holy Grail of CAT preparation. Subscribe to one good Test Series and write all the tests very sincerely in simulated environment. Fix a day, say Sunday, fix a time, say 9 AM, and give the test every week at the same time. Sit in proper position while attempting the test and tell all your roommates or family members not to disturb you at that time.Once you write 15-20 such tests, CAT will no longer be a stranger to you. When you will sit for actual CAT, you will feel as if you have done this a lot of times and it will help you to remain confident during the exam. You can buy Catking Mock Series consist of Basic and Advance level CAT questions.To improve in the Verbal section your need to have a grasp on the following:1. Reading and comprehending ability: Comprehension is more important than speed of reading2. Reasoning Skills: Improve your critical reasoning skills. This will not only help your solve the verbal reasoning questions but also the Reading Comprehensions questions3. Grammar and usageReading is important but your ability to Summarize correctly after you read an article/passage is also very vital. Work on this ability and I am sure you will be able to improve your CAT scores in this section.(Remember understanding a passage correctly is more important than reading it faster). Catking has come up with an excellent Verbal Maximizer Course which consist of 500 questions covering entire verbal syllabus with recorded solutions along with 50 Test sets.Ability in Maths is one of the most important in management entrance tests. If one considers Data Interpretation as part of maths, then the quantitative portion is 2/3rd of the paper. People who are weak in maths need not fear since a logical approach will help clear this section quite easily. Topics like number systems, percentages, profit and loss, time and distance, must be thoroughly done. A large part of the paper has algebra too, so the student must have complete knowledge of quadratic equations, functions, logs and the like.Questions on geometry and co-ordinate geometry are also asked. Hence a strategic approach towards such topics is necessary which can be taught only by the one who is experienced. Faculty at Catking are not only experienced but also Toppers of their field.

You can also watch our Quant Shortcut videos at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=....Hope it helps:)","First you all I’d suggest you have a look at CAT 2017 and analyze your strong and weak zones and then go ahead with the preps plan. This will help you in deciding whether you need individual subjects like VARC or DILR or the package of all the subjects.Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC)In my opinion Reading Comprehension (RC) comprises of 24% of the question paper, so you must ace RC. For this, you can opt for Wordpandit’s Ultimate RC course, which has the wide range of plans and variety with super talented support faculty. It gives you the detailed video of RC, grammar, and verbal ability along with facebook lives sessions and WhatsApp support. And the most beautiful part of this course is its Daily Reads followed by doubt clearing session, which expose you to diverse and intense reading required for CAT.Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI&LR) and Quantitative Aptitude (QA)DILR has been the Achilles heel for most of the CAT aspirants, while QA has been on the easier side for last 2–3 years. For these two subjects, you can go with CL’ s online classes. It has a team of prolific faculties like Gautam Puri and Gijo, who are one of the best in their respective field. Basically, this package provides assistance with all the subjects including VARC, but while preparing I felt Wordpandit for VARC has an edge.Mock test seriesFor mock CAT you can choose either CL or IMS, but I felt CL’s mock was closer to the actual CAT and its test analysis provide great insights, which actually helps tremendously in preparing the right strategy for taking CAT.Hope this will help.Good Luck for CAT- 2018.For CAT 2017 question paper: https://www.handakafunda.com/wp-...https://www.handakafunda.com/wp-...Wordpandit RC course: https://learn.wordpandit.com/?re...CL’s CAT Cracker: Smart CAT Cracker- CAT Online prep, CAT elearning","As my bio says, I work for 2iim.There is NO one best Coaching institute for CAT preparation (I still believe 2iim is the best out there, which is a discussion for another day).Each institute has a different pricing strategy, different set of teachers, Pedagogy, varied content and delivery methods. Considering all the aforementioned factors, adding to your comfortable price point, your expectations from a CAT course, to each his/her own best CAT course.2IIM started off with testimonials on our website (Reviews). All reviews are original, as is copy pasted from the emails that we have received from aspirants. When people started doubting the credibility of self proclaimed reviews, we started off reviews on neutral websites like Quora. (Quora reviews). If I saw all these a year ago, I would have accepted these to be genuine and trusted the course. However someone is very Naive if we trust these to date. It's now a generation of cyber bullying and cyber maligning. Any course review that has less than 40 reviews should be scrutinized well. CAT prep companies have learnt to game the system well. By posting good quality created content from several id's. Any course review that has extremely positive or negative reviews are to be taken with personal discretion. Proof of pudding is in the eating!Try a course. Try all the courses you want to try(if the provider lets you try).Do not let others influence your decision. Things to check: Check the price, check the method of delivery, continuous internet access required? downloadable content? cross platform access available? am i comfortable with the delivery provided by this teacher? and other sensible questions to consider. There is no one right or wrong answer. For instance, if you are from a tier 1 city with a fibernet connection, The question of downloadable content is of no purpose to you.Try preparing a comparative checklist of all that's available from an online course. We at 2IIM let anyone try upto 20% of the course for free. Forever. Any number of times. We don't have a refund policy. Try before you buy!!","The Common Admission Test scores are very crucial in determining the faith of management aspirants in India. A common question that arises in the minds of MBA aspirants is, “How to crack CAT?” When you have spent an entire year preparing for the entrance, you are determined to do anything that will give you a 99 percentile score. The following steps will assist you in achieving a good percentile-To achieve the score, you need to strategize your preparation from Day 1 itself. Understand the pattern first, identify your weak and strong areas. While doing the basics, target your weakness very well, so that you are able to solve most of the question of topic given to you. After basics the most important part comes, the Mock tests, they are the real testing waters. You will make mistakes in time bound mocks taken in actual exam conditions. You should dedicate last 3 months specifically to mock tests and analysis of every single mistake you make. If you do this thoroughly, there is high probability that you will land up near perfect score.In case you want to join any coaching Institute, I will suggest you to join KITABEE , It has maximum students clearing CAT exam in terms of Percentage. Very qualified faculty. FEES is also very LESS.For verbal………Reading everything and anything will make you clear the RC's. Just don't be biased towards sports in newspapers as I am and you will do well. Another important thing. Learn to read online. CAT is not a paper based test. Try and find blogs and articles that will test your vocab and understanding in ways unprecedented. If you're serious, people might have already suggested the HINDU and the Financial Express(or the Economic times). Well, I have the same suggestion though I never followed it. Develop a liking towards reading and it will help you in your gdpi stages. If you're not a GEM, you might get a call or two as well. On a more serious note. Read online and if possible, start a blog.Write. Share it with just a couple of people if you're scared of showing your pathetic writing skills to the world. Ask them to point out your grammatical mistakes. Try and not repeat the same mistakes in the future. As you read more, the mistakes you make will lessen.For any aspirant, the following factors are of prime importance when it comes to joining a coaching institute:1. Personal[math]Personal[/math] attention[math]attention[/math] - I think the most important factor is this. If personal attention and mentoring is missing, don't join. When you are evaluating institutes, go and check their classrooms for batch size. Ask for a demo session, if possible. Go and take a demo class you will realize why i am suggesting KITABEE.2.Faculty[math]Faculty[/math] - In addition to point 1, look for faculties who have gone through the whole process as they can understand you better and guide you better. Ask for faculty details. See if you can talk to them. According to me “Neeraj[math]Neeraj[/math] sir[math]sir[/math]” is the best teacher just call him and ask any doubt if you have. 7838804491[math]7838804491[/math], 9718375475, 9540897459.3. Content/Material/mocks[math]Content/Material/mocks[/math] -At KITABEE content is getting frequently updated to match the recent trends. As I said, not a differentiating factor. Mocks used to be a differentiating factor, go and visit Kitabee Site.In KITABEE you will get ample of materials to practise. There will be regular classes and after the completion of the class you will be given handouts which will comprise of the same thing taught in class . You should manage your time so well that you should practise every material. The study material are designed in such a way that it matches with CAT level. Believe me if you just do the study material religiously you will surely score more than 90 percentile. Besides that you will be given sectional tests which will be little advanced . And then comes the NEERAJ SIR’S AIMCAT.Clearing your doubts is another important thing to follow every time.What initially struck me about KITABEE is the Modular Approach they follow. It is very flexible and allows you to repeat topics any number of times.AS THE BATCH IS VERY VERY LESS, SO IT'S LIKE PERSONAL COACHING.Kitabee focuses even on other exams like IIFT, SNAP, NMAT, XAT etc and regular mocks and revision sessions help the students perform better in these exams as each and every exam is a different ball game and needs a different strategy to excel.As the number of students is less there is a personal bond between the students and the mentors and this makes the faculty members very much approachable. Neraj Sir and Pratik Sir are a constant source of motivation for the students and help them work harder and harder.This pic was uploaded by Kitabee on Facebook …KITABEE WILL HELP YOU IN ANALYZING ……….What are your areas of strength? For Example, Quant is your area of strength. Jolly Good!! Which subjects do you excel in Quant. Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry ?? Make sure you score cent percent in them. What are your areas of weakness?? Probability. Make sure you learn the basics to exploit the low hanging fruits.What are your areas of weakness? For example, VA (verbal ability). Which parts do you score in VA. Synonyms/Antonyms, Paragraph reading, Sentence corrections. Awesome!! Concentrate only on these areas and make sure this is enough to cross the line.Enroll for a test package.Give each test as if it the d-day. Determine time allocations as per your comfort. I generally follow 30–30–30–10 rule. 30% of time per each section to cross the line and final 10% of time to maximize my score.Your preparation doesn't end here. It starts now. After each test, go through each answer diligently. This helps you evaluate your strengths and weakness.For example, you fumbled with Data sets. Great!! Go back to basics. Read and solve everything you can lay hand on for the next one week. Your aim for the next test should be zero mistakes in Data sets.On a normal basis, your All India percentile in these tests is more or less your upcoming CAT score unless you somehow achieve super powers on the D-day and perform exceedingly well.Believe in yourSELF AND IN KITABEE ……!Aren’t you convinced yet. Well, that’s how I made it during my CAT being an average student, from an average college.And its a separate ball game altogether, if you are talking about GDPI.All the best!! Work smart, bell the CAT!!RegardsRahul"
CAT,What should be the study plan for CAT16 from May 2016 onwards?,https://www.quora.com//What-should-be-the-study-plan-for-CAT16-from-May-2016-onwards,"CAT Preparation 2016, Exam and Test Studying Strategies, Study Habits, CAT Preparation, Exam and Test Preparation, Studying, Exams and Tests",8,"Honestly, it is no biggie. You will be tested on your quants and verbal skills. Quants includes basic math. There is no higher level math such as calculus. As for the verbal section, it tests your grammar and reading skills. You can do the entire prep for 2 months and still get a good percentile. However, what really is important is to take as many mock tests as you can. CAT is all about the number of questions you get right within the allotted time. It is fairly easy to solve the entire paper without setting a time limit. The paper will have difficult questions. But at the same time, a fair share of easy and moderate ones. The key is to choose the right questions. The reason I'm stressing on mocks is because you'll get to experiment with the sections. Once you do that, you'll figure out a strategy that works for you. For concepts, I strongly recommend TIME institute’s videos. It costs about Rs.3000 and it is really worth the price. So once you go through the basics, do a lot of full length tests. Also, analyze them. You should be fine. All the best. :)","Hello First of all if you are giving CAT for first time i would suggest you to solve 1 or 2 past CAT paper .On the basis of that you can know about your speed ,accuracy,your strong and weak points.As you are starting from MAY ,this is the best possible time to start the preparation .After step 1 or if you are a retaker you would know your areas of strength and weakness .You could write it down on excel sheet your strong and weak areas ,you can mark strong areas as green and weak areas as red .You should daily put in 2-3 hrs of preparation in weak areas starting from May 16 till july 16 .Also you could do few problem of your strong areas to stay in touch with topic you know .In the month of July you could enroll for mock test series ,as a fresher CL is good option.Also Handa ka Funda is a good option.The link is here-Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams You can attend a free session there to know more about it.You can start with 1-2 mocks per week from July till October .Then increase it to 2-3 Mocks per week. More importantly analysis becomes important here and attempting mock itself.Last week before the exam go through past Cat question papers and try to solve it with 70-80% accuracy.All the Best.","Thanks for .First and foremost, I would suggest you to not keep a specific percentile in mind. The only thing you can have control over is your preparation and hard work. CAT is a very unpredictable exam and focusing more on your preparation rather than the end result will be more productive for you.Everyone has their own approach to studying but regardless of how you do it or why you’re studying it comes down to the same two things.Being able to read and understand as much as possible as efficiently as possible.Being able to remember everything.For some they want the motivation or ability to study for 15 hours a day but I think it is far better to be efficient with your studying time and get the most out of the time you can do rather than stretch it out over hours when you don’t remember most of it anyway after a session like that.Study TV suggests this free audio book which helps you improve your speed reading and memory. You can listen to it while you sleep and it has thousands of great reviews behind it: [Study Hack] Twice the Results in Half the Time","It all depends on your hard work and dedication.

CAT,How do I get a 90 percentile in the CAT if I'm currently scoring between the 50s in mocks?,https://www.quora.com//How-do-I-get-a-90-percentile-in-the-CAT-if-Im-currently-scoring-between-the-50s-in-mocks,"Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",8,"Hey bro, I won’t sugar coat and say. If your mocks are in 50s, you can increase it to around 80–85 maximum after more preparations(in mocks). The actual CAT is going to be tough. No shit. You and I will score less than the mocks in CAT. Try for 85 percentile or so. In the last 10 days you will be stressed like hell and will lose concentration often. Everyone will say you can get 90 percentile easy. Trust me bro the people who say these are people who are either scoring very well or just giving free advice.I scored 85 percentile last time after getting around 90–93 constant in mocks. I didn’t get any good b school.Anyway you paid the fees to write the exam. Go for it. Do what you were doing till now. And in the mean time, apply for TISS. It’s actually much easier than CAT, except the GK section. That you have to take care in 1 month. If you can score around 85 in CAT, you can score good in TISS.But i say it again. Write CAT like its life and death(basically it is life and death to an extend). If not, write CAT next year. This year isn’t the end of the world. So if you score good, you join a good place, else go for TISS, worst case, write CAT next year. No harm done.","Hii. Although I am not in any position to guarantee you something, but there are some important points that I need to share with you that enabled me to look past my mock scores and perform well in Cat 2017.According to me, leaving a question that you could do easily in the exam is a crime, but leaving a easy question for a tough question just because the tough question was asked before the easy one is a crime with equal sentence as one when you do a question wrong.You need to ask yourself if you are that dim a person to score so low in the mocks? And then you need to tell yourself that you know more than the person who scores 80+ percentile in the mocks, the only difference being in his application.So the next you give a mock or the real exam, you must answer the easiest questions first, what stands against this theory is human tendency to solve the questions they can, which contributes to their downfall. Because there is a time and order to solve each question, there are questions in the exam which you can solve but are better left unattempted.Read the question and ask yourself if the question in front of you is a question to be attempted just now, and if you get the answer in positive, then only attempt the question.There is one more problem here, that there must be loopholes in your preparations too. Otherwise you might have got good scores in some of your mocks.So you need to do the following.Revise your maths concepts as quickly as you can, also , practice variety of questions. You can watch my videos on Unacademy too, I have many courses of maths, with every course of 1–2 hours. Here is the link to my profile https://unacademy.com/user/s2274...View different types of sets of DI and LR. Also , remember that you need only 1–2 sets in the exam to score decently considering the level of exam asked , you might feel the heat while skipping questions in the section, but I'll suggest you to wait for those 1–2 easy sets.Practice English comprehension more. Verbal ability questions are usually difficult. Try to maximize your score in english too by improving your accuracy.In the end believing that you'll score and do well in the exam is the most important factor to succeed in the exam, if you will not believe that you can score 90+ percentile, there are no chances you are getting there.Good luck.Link to one of my coursehttps://unacademy.com/lesson/roo...","Thanks for A2A, Priya Agarwal and Rohith SharmaTo score 90 percentile you need to score around 40%~120 marks. With your current score of 50, you need to improve your score by 140%. You need to increase your knowledge base as well as the exam strategy.Knowledge buildingYou need to identify, your source of additional 70 marks. Since you cannot study a lot of topics in the last 12 days. Following is the list of the topics which can push your scores on the higher side:Reading Comprehension: 24 questions= 72 marks. This is the most important topic.Write a central idea for each paragraph. It helps in solving all main point/summary based questions.List down all the question types and your approach to solve such questions.You can study to build a full proof approach for Reading Comprehension Amazon.in: Rahul Anand, Kamlesh Chauhan: BooksArithmetic and Algebra: 12–15 questions +6–8 questions=54–69 marks. The most important module in quantitative aptitude (QA).Solve all previous year questions. This is good enough to understand the types of questions asked from these topics.Exam StrategyYou need to follow different exam strategies for each of the sections. Follow the following flow charts as a reference to make your own effective exam strategies:Verbal abilityData Interpretation and Logical ReasoningQuantitative AptitudeIf you are in New Delhi then you can attend Bfactory Last Mile Workshop at BFactory DelhiAll the bestKamlesh Chauhan","Analyze your mock results and try to decipher your strong areas. There are many types of questions in VARC section. Check which questions are most easy for you to solve. These questions would be the ones which you always get right. Then look for questions which are your average area. These questions would be the ones which sometimes you are able to solve and sometimes you are not. Then finally your weak areas. These questions you were never able to solve.After making a list of all the types of questions, you should always first attempt your strong-area questions and then average ones if you are a little bit sure about the answers and lastly, try to avoid weak-area questions because they are the cause of your negative marking and hence lower scores.At the same time, you can start focusing on your average area type questions more. Practice these questions more so that you can turn them into your strong area. This much should be sufficient for your CAT preparation.Good Luck!!!"
CAT,How can I prepare for CAT 2017?,https://www.quora.com//How-can-I-prepare-for-CAT-2017-1,"CAT Preparation 2017, CAT (Common Admission Test) 2017, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",100+,"""Many great things can be done in a day IF you don’t always make that day tomorrow""A common question troubling MBA aspirants is when to commence with CAT preparation and the answer is NOWAs mentioned by many, CAT (Common Admission Test) is one of the toughest exam to crack. It is the gateway to getting into prestigious IIMs and other top B-schools of India. So the very first thing that you should do is:Understand the syllabusThis is a useful tip for almost any exam. Understand the syllabus by going through past year’s papers and official guidelines. All the information about CAT/XAT/NMAT/TISS/MICA/SNAP/CMAT/CET are available on our website www.catking.in .CAT can be segmented into four broad parts-Quantitative AbilityData InterpretationLogical ReasoningVerbal AbilityStart your preparation with sheer determination.Know where you standA lot of successful IIM aspirants attribute their success to the efforts put in the last 4-6 months before the CAT. Take the Basic Mock test at Catking to know where you stand. This can then be used as a base to start your preparation for this year.Should you join coaching?This is based on a lot of things. If you have a lot of time, you can go for coaching. However, if you are into a hectic job and get very little time to study, you can prepare on your own or you can join online classes. Although Coaching will give you proper guidance on what to prepare, major areas to focus on, strategies to save time and also help in preparing for Group Discussions and Personal Interview. Catking is one of the best Cat classes in Mumbai and Pune. You can register yourself here www.catking.in for free demo lecture.Books and materialFirst of all, get CAT preparation material of some good coaching institute. You can buy Catking books which are apt and more than sufficient for CAT preparation.For verbal, you also need to read “Word Power made Easy” by Norman Lewis. It is a very good book which helps in increasing vocabulary not by memorising stuff, but by understanding the ideas behind the words. It is distributed into 45-47 sessions meant to be read one at a time. It is a must-read book and should be completed within two months of starting your preparation.Test SeriesThis is like the Holy Grail of CAT preparation. Subscribe to one good Test Series and write all the tests very sincerely in simulated environment. Fix a day, say Sunday, fix a time, say 9 AM, and give the test every week at the same time. Sit in proper position while attempting the test and tell all your roommates or family members not to disturb you at that time.Once you write 15-20 such tests, CAT will no longer be a stranger to you. When you will sit for actual CAT, you will feel as if you have done this a lot of times and it will help you to remain confident during the exam. You can buy Catking Mock Series consist of Basic and Advance level CAT questions.To improve in the Verbal section your need to have a grasp on the following:1. Reading and comprehending ability: Comprehension is more important than speed of reading2. Reasoning Skills: Improve your critical reasoning skills. This will not only help your solve the verbal reasoning questions but also the Reading Comprehensions questions3. Grammar and usageReading is important but your ability to Summarize correctly after you read an article/passage is also very vital. Work on this ability and I am sure you will be able to improve your CAT scores in this section.(Remember understanding a passage correctly is more important than reading it faster). Catking has come up with an excellent Verbal Maximizer Course which consist of 500 questions covering entire verbal syllabus with recorded solutions along with 50 Test sets.Ability in Maths is one of the most important in management entrance tests. If one considers Data Interpretation as part of maths, then the quantitative portion is 2/3rd of the paper. People who are weak in maths need not fear since a logical approach will help clear this section quite easily. Topics like number systems, percentages, profit and loss, time and distance, must be thoroughly done. A large part of the paper has algebra too, so the student must have complete knowledge of quadratic equations, functions, logs and the like.Questions on geometry and co-ordinate geometry are also asked. Hence a strategic approach towards such topics is necessary which can be taught only by the one who is experienced. Faculty at Catking are not only experienced but also Toppers of their field.

You can also watch our Quant Shortcut videos at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=....Hope it helps:)","We can safely assume that a preparation period of more than 8-10 months is sufficient to crack CAT. However, that does not mean one should wait till then.   If you have more time at your disposal, it would be better to start preparing right away.  So, let's take it on a phase-by-phase basis.Phase I.   Utilize time to chalk out a preparation strategy for maximum efficiency and to improve your vocabulary and general awareness (both of which cannot be done as part of a crash course)1. Analyze your strengths and weaknesses Do numbers scare you? Has probability always been a foe? Are the RC passages long and boring and put you to sleep? What about your reading speed? Is it 100 wpm or 200? Is it enough? Do words like factitious and proclivity confuse you?  Then start to work on them.2. Start reading The best way to build a vocabulary and a critical mindset which will come handy while attempting the Verbal and RC section of the examination is by reading. Read anything - books, novels, newspapers, magazines, blog posts, other online articles etc.  This will also help you to increase your reading speed (anything below 300 wpm will be a deterrent) and also to focus in case the topics in the examination are dry (for example, History, Politics etc)  Set a reading target. Also, have a target list ready.  A good place to begin will be the BBC list of Top 100 Books. A book a week would enable you to finish all 100 in less than 2 years.3. Start working on your problem solving abilities Start reading through brain-teasers. Solve logical problems. Start exercising your brain cells to boost your IQ. This exercise will be useful not only for the examination but also for your life in general.4. Extra focus on vocabulary Building a good vocabulary is a tedious exercise; one that requires a tremendous amount of patience and persistence. Thankfully, there are many tools and hacks to help you with it - word maps, flash cards etc. These visual aids always help.Phase II.  Now would be a good time to join a coaching class and start working with a schedule and deadlines ready.  Many people ask if coaching is mandatory and if you can crack the exam without it. The answer is NO; it is definitely not mandatory, however, it would be helpful because of the following reasons: Discipline: Procrastination is something everyone encounters in case of assignments with long deadlines. The same is the case here. Unless you commit to a classroom schedule, people generally tend to put it off for future. Having classes and having paid for all of them in advance ensures that you attend them, at the very least, listen to the instructor and soak in the very basic concepts.Competition and bench-marking: The classes give you a glimpse of the competition you are going to face moving forward. You would find people who come prepared for every class, listen intently to everything being said and take down meticulous notes. The same motivates you to also start working your ass off.Faculty: These guys who are going to teach you have years of experience. They are fairly familiar with the exam pattern, the types of questions that are asked and tricks to solve them in the shortest time possible.Ensure that you attend all classes and are at par with everyone else. Take out time to revisit the concepts once after the class. Trust me, it makes a lot of difference to how much of the same is retained by you.  Phase III:  This is the most important phase. Time to finally put everything you have learnt to test. Every coaching center has their own test series where you can give any no. of mock tests and you are given a percentile score to benchmark you against your peers.   A few pointers:· Aim to complete 2 mock tests per week i.e. 16 - 20 in 2 months. This will give you ample time to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses and to fine tune your strategy· Every mock test result should be analyzed and monitored to ensure that you are making clear progress with every subsequent attempt· Apart from mock tests, there are sectional tests. If after, say 5 tests, you realize that you are weak in one particular area, head over to that section and practice away. Sectional tests are around 10-20 questions for about 30 minutes each.Phase IV : A few (10-12) days before the exam  You should ideally relax for a week before the exam.1. Just read a couple of daily newspapers and avoid reading anything else so as not to cluster your mind with unnecessary information.2. Preferably pick up a book you have already read and one that you immensely adore. Re-read it.3. Listen to music.4. Talk to friends.5. Go to a good movie.6. Avoid the temptation to attempt ""one last"" mock test. At any cost. (If, by ill fate or due to nervousness, the outcome is not good, it might deeply hamper your performance in the actual exam)7. Do anything you like - if you are a painter, paint; if you are a guitarist, practice; but the most important part, take a good power nap. It will help you to relax, and will make you more productive.Cheers!","Start with confidence, whether you begin by yourself or join a coaching. Now what is this confidence that I am talking about? - CAT is an aptitude test - you have the inherent aptitude - all you need is brushing up. CAT prep is like getting ready for the big event, the skill already lies inside you. This is the CAT confidence!Now, how to plan:1.BASIC MODULE: Till 15th Septembera.Complete the basics of all the major topics once. <In class, through examples etc. Etc. Solving 10-15 questions from each chapter just to make sure that you are conceptually there should be enough>b.Read newspaper editorial for at least 30 days. Read 3-4 good novels at least – preferably authors like Ayn Rand, Robin Sharma etc. Who focus on philosophy or motivation themes.c.Appear for 2-3 full mocks just to build these four thingsi.Exam temperamentii.Accuracyiii.Selectioniv.Speed2. ADVANCED MODULE: 15th September to 15th Octobera.Focus on the CAT important topics at an advanced level (Those 10 chapters which will give you 60+ questions in CAT). Solve these topics from 1. Your advanced sheets/books 2. Your topic test module (online/offline) – do give tests to make sure that you build practice on speed as well. During the test focus on speed maximization. At the end of the test, try to solve/read solutions/clear doubts of all questions that you got wrong. Also focus on those that you could not solve. Check your mistakes/selection. Question your judgement in attempting and try to understand the pattern of your mistakes in solving/selection. Make sure you don’t repeat these mistakes in the coming tests.i.Chapter 1: Reading Comprehensionii.Chapter 2: Para jumbles/completion/summarizationiii.Chapter 3: Time, Speed, Distance, Workiv.Chapter 4: Percentage, Solution mixtures, Profit and Lossv.Chapter 5: DI Pie-Line Charts and Tabular DI. Connecting/linked tables - up to 3.vi.Chapter 6: Grouping, selection, team/matrix formation,tournaments and set theory - up to 4 sets.vii.Chapter 7: Geometry and Mensurationviii.Chapter 8: Quadratic equation/inequality and maxima minimaix.Chapter 9: Factors, remainders and divisibilityx.Chapter 10: Arrangements(Linear/Circular) and ordering/ sequencingb.For all other chapters, if time doesn’t permit – just solve 10-15 advanced questions each chapter from your books and revise it once more before CAT. It is not necessary to do tests on every topic as time won’t be enough to do it all.FULL MOCKS: Do give at least 4 full mocks this month3. Final lap: 16th October to 25th November: THE TRIMURTI FORMULA – your standard week!a.50 days left to CAT: I recommend following a STANDARD SCHEDULE now.i.TIRMURTI DAY 1: 16th Oct: Give a mock CATii.TRIMURTI DAY 1-2: 16-17th Oct: Analyze the paper after the exam at three levels1.Solve each unsolved question and understand the solution. See if you could have done it in the exam in given time and analyze whether your decision to not attempt it in the exam was right or wrong.2.Solve each wrongly attempted question and ensure that you learn from your mistake so that it doesn’t get repeated in the next exam. Wrong attempts should seriously be catered to else they become your enemies in the exams to come.3.Read the solution to the questions you got right and see if there exists a shorter solution or not!iii.TRIMURTI DAY 3: 18th Oct: Revise/Practice any topic that you think is letting you down in mocks.iv.19-20-21st Oct: Repeat the 3 day TRIMURTI pattern but this time on a previous year CAT paper.v.22nd Oct: Take a break – have fun, listen to English music and read a good novel. <This is the seventh day. So every week has 1 full mock, 1 previous year paper, analysis and revision followed by a one day break>​4.THE LAST WEEK: 26th November to 3rd Decembera.26-29th Nov: Read all the concepts that you have learnt till now. Keep making notes. Make a small TOOL BOOK/ Concept Summary of your class/coaching notes or study till now.b.1-3 October: Read CAT relevant articles – Philosophy, Psychology and Socioeconomic/Culture based articles from Wikipedia.THE KEY IS: Work, improve, check your progress and improvement.Also remember, balance your thought process properly. As you cover more and more syllabus, grow in confidence. Confidence that I can select and solve questions in the exam is the key to happy CATting! Remember, start your day with a laughter! Dive into every day with energy. Work smart, sharp and hard each day. End your day with a big smile and in a hope of reliving the laughter moment the next morning.Create strong support systems. Cut down on time extravagance and be with people who can help you perform better by understanding your exam preferences and sincerity.The article has been taken from my institute blog: Source(How to crack CAT in 4 months? by Rahul Anand Sir(alum, IIM A; Director, B-Factory))Best of luck!Rahul Sir","This the same answer I gave to a different question. But well, the questions are similar as well.Let me burst some myths first if possible.Reading newspapers in NOT sufficient or necessary for Verbal Ability preparation. I got through without reading newspaper, though I had to read it in preparation for interviews.Theoretical books DON’T help you clear Quant or LRDI. All you need from the books is practice.The so-called shortcuts do not help everyone. For example, I never do multiplication using the ‘vedic multiplication techniques’. But, put me in a contest with anyone who does that and I will always win. Only because I practiced a lot and the usual method works for me better.There is no set method to solve any kind of question. If there was, everyone would be able to answer that question. The ones who prepare the exam want people who can think. Not people who prepare.Self-preparation? I am sorry to say this, but it doesn’t work like that. Very few, probably 20–30 out of 2 lakh can do that. No one is that good. You need to get inputs from others regularly. There are a lot of things that you wouldn’t know if you study on your own.CAT is not enough! Don’t make it your sole aim to get through CAT. Interviews which come after CAT are equally, if not more, important.Now, Let’s see a general outline to improve yourself till the exam.Start writing Mocks immediately. I consider them the most important part of preparation. I took so many mocks that I felt the CAT exam as another mock. That removed a lot of pressure.Mocks give you an idea where you stand. Take it up from there. Analysis each mock you write for probably half an hour. You would know your strong and weak areas from 3–4 mocks.For verbal, reading is very important. But, rather than reading, the way you read it more important. Newspaper doesn’t help much because the style of writing is factual. There are different styles of writing and you need to be aware of all. So, read different books. There are going to be around 6 passages. These will from the domains of philosophical, historical, scientific, fictitious and reporting. Most important -’You cannot spend more than 5 minutes on any passage.’ Basically, you have to glance through the passage after reading the first paragraph in detail. You need to spend atleast 2 minutes on each question in the passage. Don’t just answer. Read the question thoroughly. I got 95 percentile in Verbal in 2015. 99.91 in 2016. Why? This was the change I adopted.Practice a lot for Quant and DILR. But, don’t ever just practice. If it was that easy, every who can do hard-work will get through. Develop your thinking abilities. Try to devise atleast 2 ways of solving every single problem. Especially for quant, try to look at the way in which you can solve the problem without using pen, paper or calculator. To develop your calculating abilities, whenever you are free to do this - Take two 3-digit numbers at random and try to multiply them in your mind. Then, check it by hand. This will help you in DILR. Look at which method works for you the best.Last but not the least, let me recommend two things for you-Try as much as possible to limit your rough work. You are not guaranteed to get more than two rough sheets in the exam. I recommend using 2 sides for DILR, 1 and half side for Quant and half if required for verbal.I recommend not using calculator for quants. I assure you from the experience of atleast 50 mocks from TIME and 2 actual CAT exams that using the onscreen calculator for quants just wastes time.Hope I was helpful.You can also follow my Blog for regular updates on preparation.cat2017prep.blogspot.in"

","Learn CAT lessons from IIM grads who have topped their CAT examination.The difficultly level and type of problems appearing in CAT demand that aspirants have complete understanding of concepts, and high levels of speed and accuracy to stand a chance to crack it. The objective of the CAT is to help select candidates who have a higher success of handling the academic rigours at the IIMs and becoming successful managers, by assessing the existence of essential traits of managers - high level of mathematical aptitude, comfort with handling data, ability to reason, and good command over the English language.While it is common perception that only the brightest and smartest in India can make it to the IIMs, nothing is farther than the truth. Any average student can avail the incredible experience and glorious opportunities at the IIMs if he/she understands what CAT is all about and prepares accordingly. Venkat Raghulan (a 99.99%ile) and his team have simplified and demystified complex CAT topics such that anyone can understand the concepts thoroughly and apply them with ease.

CAT,How is Elites Grid gaining so much popularity in the CAT online coaching?,https://www.quora.com//How-is-Elites-Grid-gaining-so-much-popularity-in-the-CAT-online-coaching,"CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",15,"I am an ELITESGRID student.I will share what happened in ELITESGRID last year.Faculties:Hemant Malhotra(Hunny Malhotra)Qa-100 percentile, DILR-99.6 percentile in CAT 2017Gaurav KapoorDILR-99.09 percentile in CAT 2017.Shahzar Khan for VA.The full course had 7 classes a week,all conducted on Wiziq(an online classroom).All these classes were live and recordings were available for us after the class. No pre-recorded classes were played,which means the faculty wasn't interested in just giving us the formulae copied from some word document and ask us to remember them or just play the recordings and save his time/energy.Concepts:He used to begin with the basics and didn't move on until and unless everyone was comfortable with the concept. So,someone who had just begun his preparations didn't have to worry about anything. He used to explain the concepts 10 times(yes 10 times if students asked him to). He made sure that we get the logic behind each formula so that even if we forget the formula,we could still solve the question.Assignments and discussions: He used to provide us the assignments and asked us to solve them within a time frame.He discussed those assignments in live classes other than the schedules classes.After the scheduled classes,he conducted another class for 3-4 hours solely for assignment discussions and didn't charge a penny for those sessions.Approaches: He explained 1 question with 3-4 methods like a geometry question with similarity,cosine rule,construction,shortcuts and approximation method.And behind every method,he gave proper logic about when to use which one.Booster Classes for DILR and Quant: This was an additional feature apart from scheduled classes, generally of 4 hours. The motto of these classes were to give us the exposure of new and different varieties of DILR sets in order to boost our thought processes which is the need of the hour.For the last 3 years DILR is on the higher side of difficulty level in terms of newer unseen sets. Quant booster was to give us the exposure of various approaches to solve questions and important concepts that we need to keep in mind while solving quant questions.Mocks and sectional test discussions: After our syllabus was covered,he used to discuss mocks' strategies and how to use sectional tests to improve score in mocks-Which questions to attempt first and which questions to leave for last 20 minutes or so.He used to solve sectionals or mocks by himslef on facebook live or in wiziq classes and showed us the strategies to be used while writing mocks.Again these sessions were conducted apart from the scheduled classes.Facebook Events for practice: For Quants,extra Facebook sessions were taken where mixed or topic wise questions were posted.After that he posted solutions of those questions and he posted video solutions as well. For DILR,extra facebook events were taken too where different and new types of sets were posted.Video solutions were provided for the sets and he used facebook live too and explain the sets live.For VA Wiziq classes were conducted solely for practice purpose.RCs,critical reasoning,parajumbles etc. ,all were discussed in those sessions.Full day revision sessions: On facebook live,he took FULL DAY REVISION SESSIONS.We didn't have to go through the recordings or open out notebooks for revision.He took many live sessions and after that he asked us which concepts did we want him to take sessions on again.And he took sessions on all concepts,we asked him to.Articles and blogs group: One group was formed just to improve our reading habit.Files of newspaper articles,novels etc. were uploaded in that group and hence we didn't have to worry about what to read.Personal guidance: If someone was lagging in one particular area or a whole subsection/section,personal guidance was also provided to us where we discussed how to improve this area or how to improve this section in Qa/Va/Dilr.I think if the faculties are working harder than the students to provide them everything they can,they should be popular,shouldn't they?This link will tell you more about why is ELITESGRID being popular:https://www.facebook.com/elitesg...For further assistance:Visit:Elite Grid AcademyJoin our Facebook public group:https://www.facebook.com/groups/...I hope this answer gives you what you were looking for.Cheers..!!","Disclaimer: I happen to be the founder of Elites Grid and thus, my answer may be a bit biased. But then again, what’s a little bias between friendsNow, to answer your question as to why Elites Grid (or EG, as we are commonly known) is gaining popularity, I must highlight why EG is different from most of the online, and even offline classes that you know of:1. Personal Attention:EG is known for giving personal attention to people. We receive doubts even at 3–4 AM in the morning. We take individual one on one sessions for literally every single student that enrolls with us, because we understand that every individual is unique and their strategy must be completely different, and idiosyncratic.But it doesn’t stop here.EG’s mentoring and personal attention goes way beyond the vantage point of CAT as an aptitude test. EG’s team has Bankers, Lawyers, IT Professionals, Consultants, Professional Traders, and Marketing Experts from FMS, MICA, Xavier’s and whatnot. Owing to this exposure, we know what works in the practical market to get you that dream profile. That exposure to various fields helps us to mentor and guide people in all domains and all respects of life. Not just the aptitude part of it.2. Unconventional Methods:Our teaching isn’t just limited to online classes. We know what works, and we will use the most effective and efficient platform to deliver the content to people.For our regular classes, we use the WizIQ platform, which, if you aren’t aware of it, is a lot like the Webex systems used in corporate houses, but is better suited for conducting classes.Check Here - WAY TO IIMS | ELITES GRID - DEMO CLASS FOR CAT/XAT/IIFT & OTHER MBA ENTRANCE EXAMSFor Doubts, we use Facebook Groups, Whatsapp Groups, Website forums, in addition to WIziq Platform that enables students to ask questions without any delay. Have a doubt? Just take a picture or screenshot and upload it in the group, and we’ll answer it within minutes. It’s that easy.Log into Facebook | Facebook3. 24/7 Doubt Solving:I personally feel that more than anything else, it’s the doubts that maketh a man. If you have a query, it’s highly unlikely that you would be able to move on to the next concept. If you have a doubt, it should be resolved within seconds. We, at ElitesGrid , aim to achieve just that. All of the doubts are resolved within minutes, and if the students think that it is something that cannot be posted, for instance, a strategy doubt, then they can simply call us. We’re always available for our students (except when we are taking classes. Please don’t call us during that window).4. Practice:Fine, we have taught you live for a couple of hours, but how do you know whether you’ve actually grasped the concept?By practicing it, obviously.In 2017, EG Team posted more than 5000 questions, EXCLUDING assignments, classroom questions, and mocks. To put that into perspective, we get an average of 1.8 minutes per question in CAT (100 questions, 180 minutes). That’s a total of 5000*1.8 minutes, or 150 hours just for dedicated practice. add the 400 hours worth of official class timings, You get a total of 550 hours of back to back questions, concepts, strategies, discussions, doubts and success. If you can practice that much, I doubt you would be required to solve anything else.The number, 550 hours, is at least twice of what any other coaching institute offers, even after charging 5x as much for their course. That’s what makes EG so popular.5. The EG Team:As mentioned above, our team has people who have worked with Adobe, McKinsey, Vedanta, Deutsche Bank, Amazon, DE Shaw. We have people who have graduated from FMS, IIM Indore, Xavier’s, MICA, and people who have converted most of these colleges but chose not to join them for they wanted to continue working with EG to make a difference.But there’s more.The EG team also has a QA 100 Percentiler. An LRDI 99.6+ Percentiler . A VA 99 Percentiler. What more can a student ask for?6. Unparalleled Efforts:I know this point specifically may sound a bit biased. But here’s an Platonist approach towards approaching this. We ask questions and in turn you’re supposed to think:Q1: How many tutors do you know who have taken LIVE classes for 15 hours, for 5 days in a row? (Check here)Log into Facebook | Facebook - 12 Hours Algebra ClassLog into Facebook | Facebook- 11 Hours LR-DI ClassQ2: How many tutors do you know who can post 10000 questions with detailed solutions? (Check here) Log into Facebook | FacebookQ3: How many tutors do you know who will make designated and detailed Video Solutions to questions that you can’t fully comprehend?“These are some of the doubts posted by students”LR-DI Doubts - LRDI puzzle of the day #16 | CAT PREPARATION BY ELITES GRIDQA Doubts- FB Group Doubt 1 (Equiangular Hexagon)|CAT PREPARATION BY ELITESGRIDWell, I know only a handful of such people, and all of them work with ElitesGrid.7. Unique Stratagem for VARC:We understand that a person who scored a 70th percentile in CAT needs to approach the paper in a different manner than the one who scored a 99.To help with this, we started an initiative, called “The Dark Horse” to help people bridge that gap. While a 95+ percentiler can rely on practice and classroom sessions to improve significantly, same might not be the case for a person with a 19th percentile in VA.Dark Horse uses a unique set of assignments, constant mentoring, that help people to score that coveted 99 percentile.8. Fees - Well you might be wondering I have written 'The main course' and 'The deserts' but did not wrote anything about starters. So, here it is. 3. Nominal fee (The starters) The fee for CAT 2017 regular batch was Rs. 12500 /- only and students were supported till XAT 2018. So, if we give a summary then 12500 for 12 months means around Rs. 1000 for a month. What else can a person ask for. Even tuition fee for a single subject at school level is much higher than this. I hope I have answered your question aptly. If still in doubt check our result reviews.8.The Result - We have at least 10 people, from a group of 200, who improved their percentile from a 19–20 in CAT 2016 to 92+ in CAT 2017.CAT 2016 Result- (Check Here) Log into Facebook | FacebookIIFT 2016 Result- (Check Here) Log into Facebook | FacebookCAT 2017 Result - (Check Here) Log into Facebook | FacebookSnap 2017 Result- (Check Here) Elites GridIIFT 2017 Result - (Check Here) Elites GridStudent’s Review- (Check Here) Log into Facebook | Facebook , Log into Facebook | Facebook","The famous Irish poet and playwright, Oscar Wilde once said, “Confidence is good But overconfidence always sinks the ship”.These golden words are a testimony to a fact which has gone unnoticed, as far as the area of CAT preparation in India is concerned.If we take the example of the biggest players, by market evaluation, in the area of CAT preparation in India, they are TIME and IMS. These two firms have time and again dominated the CAT preparation domain in India.But in my opinion, in the last five to six years, these firms have started viewing the occupation of training students for CAT, as a major business venture and have gotten overconfident. This is very evident from the following listed reasons: -Hefty Fee StructureAs of 2017, IMS charged 30,000 Rupees for a one year course with an extra year of continued classes (Seriously of no use). TIME also charges in the upwards of 35000 Rupees for its course.Incompetent FacultyFrom my experience, the IMS faculties in Bangalore and Mysore have been a total disappointment. They follow no structure of classes. The schedule was haphazard. A total mess!Lackadaisical AttitudeThe IMS and TIME firms are hell bent on making money. All they care about is money. Whether a student is progressing or not, is not their concern at all.Now, coming back to the main question of why the emergence of online CAT coaching institutes is on the rise, especially Elites Grid’s.As a CAT aspirant, i was utterly disappointed with the reasons mentioned above. Probably that was also the reason why I couldn’t score in the 90s and ended up my CAT 2017 percentile being in the 80s.I was in search of a new platform to learn from a dedicated group of faculties, who would primarily focus on the performance of the students.Also, as a full time employee of Infosys, it used to be very difficult for me to commute every day from my office to the classes. It used to take a big toll on my health. After coming across Elites Grid, I can confidently say that the graph of my performance in CAT 2018, is definitely going to go up.Some key points that make Elites Grid, unique :-Faculty that really CARES!Young, Energetic and extremely talented. The faculty at Elites Grid is simply awesome. The QA part is taken care by Hunny Malhotra sir.A 100 percentiler in QA in CAT 2017, he is nothing short of a mathematical magician. Sir has his unique methodology where he focuses on learning the concepts instead of mugging the formulas (Something that we have been taught since day one :/ ).The VARC section is taken up by Shahzar Sir, who is an English aficionado. Be it any grammar related doubt or any query concerning MBA, he is THE MAN!Coming to LRDI, this section is taken up by yet another talented person named Gaurav Kapoor. A 99.9x percentiler in LRDI in CAT 2017, he is really humble and always ready to help you out with any sort of LRDI question.Constant Practice!There is constant learning and constant practice every single day. Even if you are attending a lecture in your college or are at the office, you would have continuous questions and learning in the form of Facebook posts that would make sure that you do not lose your touch with the CAT preparation.Cost Effective!As I mentioned earlier how in the name of education, institutes like IMS and TIME charge hefty amounts. But this is not the case with Elites Grid. The cost is only 30% of the amount quoted by most of these institutes and they also provide the flexibility of paying it in installments. Can it get any better???Unique Pedagogy!Within a span of just two months, I came across so many different methods to solve questions. These methods were not even known to me prior to joining Elites Grid and I was simply clean bowled by the simplicity with which a complex problem could be solved by such methods.Their unique pedagogy makes the classes very interesting.All I have to say about Elites Grid is that the reason they are gaining so much of popularity in the domain of online CAT preparation is because they do not have the ulterior motive of exploiting students in the name of Education. What makes them successful are the blessings and good wishes, they receive from thousands of students who have realized their dreams come true because of ELITES GRID.A big shout out to the entire team of Elites Grid. Wishing them loads of success in the time to come.To anyone who is a CAT aspirant and looking forward to CAT 2018, all i would say is the great quote by Laozi, “ The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step”.So take that one step forward and see your dreams come true!Links: -Elites GridHunny Malhotra- CEO at ElitesGrid CAT PreparationShahzar KhanGaurav KapoorFacebook page:- Log into Facebook | Facebook","When the mentors feel like friends and family, the learning process becomes much easier. That’s the USP of ELITES GRID. I am currently a student of Elites Grid and feel that joining EG was one of the best decisions of my life. I will tell you how.Being from a non-mathematics background, I was a student who always felt that CAT, especially Quantitative Aptitude and LRDI, can never be tamed. These two sections had always been a nightmare for me until I started learning under the esteemed mentors at Elites Grid. Hunny Malhotra (Cat 2017 quant 100%iler) and Gunjan Verma are the faculties of Quants at EG and have simply the best methodologies of teaching. When Hunny sir starts teaching, he explains everything right from the basics and doesn’t hesitate in answering to even the lamest of all doubts such as- what is 2+2? His level of patience is unmatched and he keeps reiterating the same concept till the time a student understands it even if it means extending classes an hour or two above the stipulated time. His dedication for his work and towards his students is the first thing that has made EG popular.No doubt logic has to be developed by a person himself but a direction or the way of approaching a LRDI question is all that makes the difference. At EG, Gaurav Kapoor and Hunny Malhotra help their students in building the right approach to solve a question. Owing to the skyrocketing levels of difficulty of LRDI in the past few years, a lot of care is taken by the mentors to introduce perfect CAT level questions and discuss the way they should be tamed. The LRDI team leaves no stone unturned to make the students ready for any kind of bouncer that CAT LRDI can throw at us. This is another reason of thr high popularity of EG.People say English can never be taught. That’s right! But an approach can be taught and developed to tame this subject especially for CAT. Shahzar Khan and Sushant Kohli , our VARC mentors at EG, do exactly that for us. The regular article updates on the facebook groups help us a lot to increase our reading speed and comprehension power, thanks to Shazhar Sir! The explanations for the verbal ability questions like Para Jumbles or Odd man out etc. given by Sushant sir and Shahzar sir are truly commendable. How to approach a certain RC question? How to skim through a passage?- all this is well taught to us by them. This is another reason as to why EG is becoming popular.The above cited paragraphs highlight the exceptional teachers and their teaching methodologies. Let’s look at the other points:24*7 doubt clearance is another reason why EG is becoming popular. Ping any teacher even in the odd hours like 3 a.m. in the morning (or night, whatever you call it ) and the teachers will be happy to clear your doubts. Where else do you get this?Assignments and materials- The mentors at EG always keep posting some assignment or the other related to the topics that have been covered in the class. The assignments are a perfect blend of CAT or OMET level of questions. Doesn’t it deserve appreciation?Booster classes- Day long classes and sessions on multiple topics that are important from the CAT point of view are taken up by Hunny sir. The discussion of various approaches for a single question, thought process building for the DILR questions and exposure to all types of questions are the motto of these classes. This is a big reason of the high popularity of EG.I have cited a lot of things above. If you don’t believe it, you can take a look at the public group on FaceBook. Link: Log into Facebook | FacebookFor more free contents and details on the course, visit: Elite Grid AcademyIf you still feel dubious about EG, I would like to bring it to your notice that more than 50 students have scored above 95 percentile and above with close to 20 students scoring in the much coveted bracket of the 99th percentile. This is a big reason of increasing popularity of EG.I hope it helps! All the best!"

Also while reading a newspaper we get exposed to a wide range of subjects(eclectic reading).Flash cards.

NEVER go mechanical.Hope This helps. All the best.","Though you don’t find many vocabulary questions in CAT, still they form a major part of your Verbal Ability preparation. If you are just not aiming CAT and are planning for other exams, say, XAT or IIFT or SNAP, then chances are you would come across such direct Vocab questions. Now, the interesting point over here is- how one makes sure that he ace those questions.Note: If you really want to master at developing your vocabulary skills, you need to make sure you move beyond the ‘Use Flash Cards’ notionVocabulary Development would test your patience. If one intends to do that one is advised to follow theseDictaphoneA Dictaphone is a device used to record sounds for a later playback. Whenever I came across a word, I recorded its meaning and made a sentence and recorded the same. I made sure that I listened to the recording for 2–3 times a day. Vocabulary Development would want you to have an outstanding and a winning memory. If you take the first step by listening and speaking again and again, then only it would make a difference.MnemonicsA visual Vocabulary or Mnemonics make the word understandable easily and also helps you remember for a longer time. CAT aspirants can followWordpandit | Learning Made FunEditorial PagesThe editorial pages have been quite famous among CAT aspirants, The Hindu’s being one of them. Students who read the editorial pages and search for the words they tend to come across over there, are more exposed to the the direct questions that could have been asked in XAT or IIFT or SNAP or at times even CAT.Multiply WordsWhat one wants while vocabulary development is learn More Words. I have developed a way which would help the CAT Aspirants learn many words at a time. This technique is to multiply that one word by many similar words. Let’s say I learnt a word ameliorate. Now I know its meaning and I even made a sentence to test its usage. Now while I learn that word, I make a note of all the possible synonyms, antonyms , idioms and I learn a few of them . Ultimately I am learning only one word, but multiplying it to many other words that exist. Chances are you end up learning many words and remembering them after the exercise.Read diversity‘Reading a lot’ is a free advice given by many. What they miss out on recommending is – What kind of Reading helps?. There are 5 essential items that you come across in any newspaper. I call these 5 items- A life saver. Herein if you plan to improve upon your reading speed or learn the commonly seen good words in the diverse material, then this would be a life saver. Also there are many good blogs like- A letter to CAT aspirants or VA Analysis. Reading novels like- “ Love in the Time of Cholera” and “Gulliver’s Travels would help you develop a good vocabulary.Review CheckCAT aspirants focus on just doing the many of what already exists. They forget that even if they do less and excel the limited part done by them, chances are they would achieve what they want. Learning as many words as is possible is not the point. Remembering whatever you learnt and marking upon the correct option in the exam is the main issue here. After every 5 days of learning such words, go for a mental exercise of recalling what all you did in those 5 days. Start from the Day 1.. Repeat this exercise after every 5 days and increase the span of time as you feel you know the words thoroughly","CAT’15 VA/RC: 85%ileCAT’16 VA/RC: 99.74 %ile, and very good scores in verbal section in IIFT, NMAT, MICA, and SNAP in 2016.and I would attribute this to drastic increase in my vocabulary, and hence, my reading speed and comprehension.This is what I suggest to improve vocabulary -A daily read of ‘Editorial Section (On website: Opinion->LEAD)’ of ‘The Hindu’ newspaper. And it is not just reading, it’s also important how you read it. Here is a brief to it-Do not read it from the newspaper, rather read it on your laptop/tablet. As you will start reading it, you will come across at least 5 words, in the article for which you wouldn’t have known the meaning. A common tendency is to search for their meaning , try to fit in the context and move on with reading. Now, this is what everyone does, but if you want to build your vocabulary, you have to do a little more! As you search for the meaning on google or on a online dictionary (google is recommended), you need to do three things-(This should also be done, whenever you come across any new word in any mock/article or anything that you read)i) Copy-Paste the meaning (along with all the examples and synonyms) in a Onenote/Google doc - so that you have a live repository, which you can access everywhere (I have provided an image and a word doc to show how I did it)ii) Search for the image associated with that word, just click the images option on google, you would get all the images that are closely or remotely associated with that word. This is very crucial if you want to build your vocabulary (regular and contextual both). I don’t need to emphasize how relating to an image would help you remember and understand the word better than just reading the meaning of it.[If you understand Hindi, then you can also try searching with suffix ‘meaning in Hindi’, for quite a few words a website - Dailyvoacb (English to Hindi Meaning with Picture Dictionary) has created Memes, that help in remembering them]Copy-Paste these images next to meaning and examples in your doc. All I want to convey is that spend some time with the word, understand it’s meaning, usage, examples, synonyms and, try to make a visual memory of it with the use of images. Gist is - Get the feel of the word! {It will just take 30 secs extra to search for an image and to copy pasti it into the doc, and I would suggest to invest those 30 secs while coming across the word 1st time, rather than looking at the same word again in next mock and cursing yourself for not remembering it’s meaning}iii) If you continue making this collection of words, you would have a humongous word dictionary of yourself having an image for every word. But, now the problem is that you yourself wouldn’t remember all of it. To sort this problem, revise the list every week or decide a frequency as per your convenience. I can also elaborate on how I revised them, but that would make the answer a very long read, and it doesn’t matter a lot, a simple glance at words will also do.I believe following the above three steps religiously and a continuous reading of Editorial section of The Hindu, will take care of vocabulary, familiarity with varied topics and will help in developing the skill to read and comprehend any topic, given that one reads the editorial, irrespective of the topic and try to comprehend it.Another point is, in-depth analysis of every mock that you take. I think your teachers at coaching (or you tube videos) would have given enough knowledge on how to analyze mocks for every section specifically. Make sure, you know each and every word that has come in your VA/RC section of your mocks, and if those words/phrases get repeated again, you shouldn’t stuck.This is how my OneNote looked like, when I prepared -P.S. - As the question is about vocabulary, this answer is highly centered on developing vocabulary, but it is not the only aspect of scoring good marks in CAT VA/RC section. I believe a combination of below four skills is required to score exceptionally good marks-1. Above average vocabulary (including common foreign words)2. Familiarity with varied topics and the common jargon of every topic (Economics, Philosophy, Science and Technology, Literature, etc.)3. Skill to read and comprehend any topic in English language, irrespective of your liking! I would rather define it as ‘skill of cold reading’ i.e., having no empathy/apathy towards the subject4. Ability to answer the questions, even if you don’t understand the passage completely (believe me, it can be done)Along with vocabulary, please try to build up on these skills, if you aim to be in top 1%ile in verbal section in Indian management entrance exams.All the best for your CAT journey!Edit: As many people are asking for this doc, I want to suggest that, sharing this doc will not do any good to you, it will just be like having a dictionary with pictures. This method to improve vocabulary will only work, if one creates that collection of words by himself, as the whole idea lies in spending some time with the word, looking for its various meanings and associated pictures. However, for reference I am uploading few parts of the doc, below are the links for it-English Word list (P.S. This is not a comprehensive list, this is just to give an idea) - English Words.docxConfused Words - Confused Words.docx","To ace in CAT, only building vocabulary is not important. Understanding the usage of those words and identifying the meaning of new words in a new context is equally important, since there is an increased weightage of Reading Comprehensions (RCs) in the exam.To build vocabulary, first you need to understand how words are formed and how you can sometimes guess the meaning of words using roots. For this, I would highly recommend you to read ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. In addition to that, you need to use those words in daily life while communicating or writing. Maybe have a friend who's also preparing give you a few words (7-10) for the day to be used in the discussions that day and you give him a few words too. It will be fun. Read. Read a lot. Articles, novels whatever you can get hold of. I would highly recommend you to understand a full article daily from Arts & Letters Daily. It will be difficult at first but it will surely mature your vocabulary and comprehending abilities. Other than that, read news from The Hindu, New York Times, BBC, etc. It will be better if you can identify the areas you are weak in with regard to RCs like history, science, literature, etc. For me, it was literature articles that were taking many readings for me to understand. Read that weak area topic articles more. Also, it will help you remember the words if you write - maybe the summary of novels you read, or just a random poem which uses the words you read that day or just general vocabulary. Everything will help. In the end, remember improving vocabulary is a process and wouldn't happen magically over a week. Continue improving and using what you learn. All the best ! "
CAT,I'm scoring just 40-50 percentile in CAT mocks. How can I prepare for 99+ percentile?,https://www.quora.com//Im-scoring-just-40-50-percentile-in-CAT-mocks-How-can-I-prepare-for-99+-percentile,"Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests, Personal Question",13,"First and foremost, I would suggest you to stop being so obsessed with mock scores. You’re yet to do justice to your preparation and once you’ve actually practiced enough, you’ll see major improvements. Use mock tests for assessing your weaknesses, not as a parameter of your potential. The only thing you can have control over is your preparation and hard work. CAT is a very unpredictable exam and focusing more on your preparation rather than the end result will be more productive for you.More importantly, here are some suggestions that might help you with your preparation.This is for people who are planning to write CAT and is based on my personal experiences and what I learned during my CAT journey. You might disagree with some of these things, and I am open to suggestions from each one of you.First and foremost thing that you need to do is bring a huge change in the way you do things every day. Try and utilize every single minute of free time for preparation. Whenever free, try and do something that will help you in one way or the other (mental calculations/reading/revising formulas etc).People in a very demanding job, stop giving excuses that you are not able to study because of work. Even though it is true, there is nothing that you can do about it except maybe resign (The worst possible thing that you can do for CAT prep). So take it as a challenge. 2 hrs per day on weekdays and 6 hrs per day on weekends is more than enough for scoring a very good percentile in CAT. Enjoy this preparation, this struggle. Do not think about the result too much, focus on the process, the journey.I will give you some key points in no specific order -1. If you are a 1st timer, write a mock test, any mock, and get a rough idea as to where you stand right now.2. Get hold of study material from any institute and make sure that you go through at least QA and LR from start to end asap.3. A very important thing (that most people don't do) is that every time you try and solve questions, do it with time limit. Right from the very first question of the study material you pick up. CAT is a speed based game these days and you'll be able to develop that skill only with practising speed day in and day out. Every time you plan to study even for a stretch of say 30 mins, plan to solve say 18-20 questions in those 30 mins with a timer and try and maximise your score in this. This way, you'll develop the art of leaving questions. And then devote another 30-60 mins to learn from the questions you couldn't solve or solved wrongly. Practising within time limits makes your brain think faster and more efficiently under stress and you try and maximise your score this way. I repeat, DEVELOP THE ART OF LEAVING QUESTIONS.4. Once you start writing mocks, maintain an excel sheet to keep track of questions in VA and QA topic wise. After every mock, during analysis, just fill this excel sheet, something like this -VARC -At the end, apply a formula that will give you details about % attempt (A/T*100) and % accuracy (C/A*100) topic wise. After 10-15 mocks, you'll be very clear about which topic you are attempting less, where your accuracy is pathetic etc etc. It will help you much more than you realise. Around Sept/Oct when you'll be finalising a strategy for the final exam, this data will help you in deciding how to approach the paper. It definitely helped me a lot.5. Maintain a thick notebook with all the QA formulas and keep updating it with every mock/sectional test you give. Revise it once every 20-30 days. By Oct, these formulae should become an extension of your mind. Recalling them instantaneously during mocks/CAT is VIMP. You can utilise travel time to office for revising this, I did.6. Mental calculations are very important. As pagalguy CAT legend calls it, THINK without INK. You can practice this on a regular basis. Do whatever calculations you do during work/college without a calculator. As much as possible. In these 8 months, you can develop this skill exponentially by practising it daily. Challenge yourself. Lying in bed, about to sleep, ask yourself, what is 347x218? What is 59674-47392? Now try and visualize this. Make these calculations a habit and a part of your life. Trust me, it will help you in more ways than you can imagine even long after the CAT is over.7. For VA/RC, people say that reading a lot of novels and newspaper helps. But I feel that reading helps a lot, definitely. But instead of investing time in novels/newspapers, invest that same amount of time in solving RC passages on various themes and topics (With a time limit of course). This way, you'll practice a lot of reading as well as you'll also practice spotting answers for questions. Buy any popular book with 100s of RCs and start doing this.8. About books, I can't really comment about which one to go for as I didn't use any. My preparation was only from 47 mock tests I wrote and 40+ sectional tests.9. Mock tests are the single most important step in your CAT preparation. It prepares you for the final battle by simulating the same. Enroll in at least one among the big 3 and if possible, enrol in two (I would recommend SIMCATs+AIMCATs). Take every single mock very very seriously. You could write 30 mocks or 130 (depending on the amount of time that you can devote for CAT prep), but please take all of them very seriously. Analysing mocks is twice as important as writing one. Find out why you solved a particular question wrong or why you left a particular question. Update the 'thick notebook' that you made for QA with new formulas/concepts that you see in these mock tests' solutions. Solve the unsolved RCs/DILR sets later on (Try and do this too in time limits). Devote more time to analysing mocks than to write them. Learn everything that you can from every mock that you write. Try and write the next mocks only after analysing previous mock thoroughly. You will find this analysis very difficult and you'll have an urge to just skip it and write the next mock, but don't. I personally analysed only 38 out of 47 mocks thoroughly due to lack of time. Do this analysis not just for mocks but for sectional tests as well.10. DO NOT try to do too many things. Someone will try and do mocks, various books from Indian authors, even GMAT books, then lots of reading, then improve grammar with several grammar improvement books, then vocab improvement books, solving questions on pagalguy, solving questions on various sites, various study materials etc etc etc. KEEP IT SIMPLE. Don't get caught up with all this. Don't ask for too many suggestions. Talk to a few good people, make a good plan that you feel will work for you and just do it.11. Try and improve your English writing and speaking skills as much as you can today onwards. Practice it at home/office/college as much as you can. This will help you a lot during the final step after CAT result. This is something that will take time to improve (Only for those who are not too comfortable with English)12. DO NOT get affected by a change in pattern or any other changes. Take it as a challenge and as an opportunity to develop yourself as per the need.13. A time will come when things will not go your way at all. Your mock scores will fall and you'll start doubting yourself. DON'T. Get yourself up and fight harder. No matter how bad the performance is, keep going. Trust me, you'll face this, but don't let it demotivate you. Take it as a reminder that you've so much to learn.14. Develop a balanced performance across all 3 sections. This is very important. Devote more time to your weak areas and work on it until you are good at that too.14. Keep calm. Develop this skill with every mock you write. This way, you'll not get all tensed up during CAT and will be able to perform to your full potential. You'll be able to take CAT as just another mock test.15. Stop wasting time. As Madonna puts it, ""I am gonna delay my pleasure"". Delay it for 9 months, all those parties, movies, hangouts can wait. Right now, FOCUS.NEVER SETTLE","I am sharing you basic top strategy for CAT exam section wise. You can apply the same in mocks , check results and improvise. Recently few students could increase their percentile from 75 to 95 in Mocks using this strategy. For a personalised strategy according to your performance, please contact me .*Strategy For VA+RC*1. Try to attempts VA last , as in the last 10 minutes it is difficult to solve a new RC but VA can be easily done.2. While starting, read the topic , first few lines of RC,(avoid abstract of difficult topics you are not comfortable) , questions asked (you may avoid tone/style questions type RC first, questions which ask to arrange the options or such, and cannot be determined options).3. Now mark first question of each RC. This will help you to jump from one RC to another easily.4. After this process , solve first 3-4 RC with more no .Of questions , comfortable topics and questions.5. When you read RCs , you can read some questions so that you can get a rough idea where you need to concentrate. Don't try to read twice -thrice and waste more time in RC.6. Try to have min of 15-20 mins after solving 3-4 RC sets , so that you can solve VA.7. For VA , solve the easier one you are comfortable with. Don't guess work here if it is a negative marking . Target 5-6 questions here. You can choose fine odd one out, paragraph questions , or parajumbled as you are comfortable.Note: Always see you click save after marking an option. Your target here should be 20-24 questions with an accuracy of 80%+ to get an ideal 90%.Strategy for LR+DI section:1. First scroll all LR and DI sets , mark first question of each LR DI set you are gonna do. There can be a mix of LR+DI instead of 4 DI first and LR last. So be prepared.2. Selection of top 3-4 LR DI sets is important. You should choose according to sets. (Avoid the ones you always do wrong/skip in mocks or finding complex), check questions too and you may avoid such sets where question are complex and tricky .3. Don't guess work in LR DI sets . It may happen first question is not doable or you are not able to all questions of the set. Don't panic leave that question and do rest.4. Target atleast 3-4 LR-DI sets if they are difficult. 5-6 LR-DI for a moderate to easy sets. Here your accuracy should be more than 90%. This can easily fetch you 90%+5. While solving LR sets , always try to put information on the paper using some notation or short tricks. Like in a family chain question, you can put a circle for male and square for female. You can put an arrow connecting two persons if identified married. Similar way. Such notations in all sets of LR is helpful.6. For DI or data sets, always try to put information in table format , if required in set format. Don't directly go on solving all unknown. First read the questions what it is asked and then go ahead.*Strategy for Quants*1. Read all 34 questions. There can be easy questions at end too.2. In first 20-25 minutes , try to scroll till 34 questions . Solve easiest of all. Mark doable lengthy or little moderate ones. 10 questions should be solved. 10 may be marked for review to do later.3. In next 20-25 minutes, now Jump to marked for review . Again be choosy. Skip , don't stuck and solve again easier ones first.4. Remaining time 10 mins (if any) can be used to select some remaining marked for review or other questions you feel you can attempt.5. Do not guess answer and mark randomly. It is important to have a good accuracy. Always use clean rough sheet and circle important information and outcomes to avoid missing any.Note : Decent attempts should be 20-21 with an accuracy of 80%+ to get a 90 percentile + in CAT.Disclaimer: This is a just recommended strategy from Funda Clear Team. You can have your own improvised and constable strategy. Also Percentile and minimum attempts is subject to level of difficulty in CAT and relative performance as well.Funda Clear TeamFundaClear","Becoming a 99+ percentiler needs the focus, time management, efficiency. For this you need a mentor or a guide who can make your journey to IIM more smooth. While going for CAT Coaching Institute, don’t rush where everyone is rushing, rather analyse what these institute are offering and what result they are producing and among how many students they are producing that result.There are numerous CAT Coaching institutes in Delhi NCR, that claims themselves to be the Best CAT Coaching Institute but spoils your journey by the time CAT is near and then you rush towards another to rectify your mistake, so it is better you take the sound decision in first go.T.I.M.E., Career Launcher, Alchemist, Byju’s and the list is very long. Recently, WhatAfterCollege has released the list of Top 7 CAT Preparation Institutes in Delhi to help you crack CAT exams and Ranked Alchemist as no. 1 coaching institute for CAT. The reason is the innovative technology Alchemist have for CAT preparation which enables student to increase the efficiency and decrease the disturbing and outside elements from their preparation.Alchemist have a different approach for Cracking CAT. To know more about it visit - Best CAT Coaching","Hey!You are attempting mocks means you have cover 75% syllabus of CAT (I assume) because without covering 75% syllabus mock is just a formality. 40–50 percentile in mock is not so bad but not so good also if you are attempting good mock series who matches the level of CAT. Now you have to focus on improving percentile in mocks. Improvement can be done by recognizing our mistakes during mock than workout on those mistakes. Analysis of mock will help you in this.Analysis every mock and Keep following points in your mind during this-Focus on the number of errors made. Try to minimize errors, they don’t have more than 2 in QA section, not more than 2 in LRDI section, not more than 20% in VARC section. If you are doing more error than this number means you are also attempting those question also whom your are not 100% sure.Look beyond scores and percentiles. Score and percentile is just a number, they might make you feel good or bad but you have to look beyond this.Attempt the entire paper again. An average CAT aspirant attempts 50–60 question in mock mean they have miss out a large number of good questions. Re-attempt it again without time pressure.Analyze your question, set, passage selection. After re-attempt the mock evaluate yourself on those parameters- Did I attempt the correct questions in Quant?, Did I pick the right sets in LR/DI?, Did I pick the right passages in RC? etc in my first attempt.Identify the strategy that works best for you. Follow a strategy that will help you to solve more question. According to me attempt every section in two phases. In phase 1 attempt all easy question that you can solve easily in less time and mark those question that can be solved by you but they take more time. In phase 2 attempt all marked question. This strategy will sure you that you don’t leave any easy question.Figure out the number of mocks you need. Attempt at-least 10 mocks before CAT exam.Do not attempt section wise mock. Always attempt full length mocks. Because full length mocks will feel you actual exam not section wise mock.Identify your weak areas. After analysis 2–3 mocks, you will identify your weak areas and than work out on that before attempting next mock.Check if you are slipping in your strong areas. Some time this happen when you are over confident on your strong area and don’t give enough time to this. You can identify this during identify weak area. This should not be happen, if this is happen than work out on it also.Plan your next mock. After a mock analysis you can allot time for your weak area, other thing etc than schedule next mock.Helping Hand to Improve Weak AreasOnline course is the one of best way to improve your weak areas.

CAT,Is it good to take BYJU's CAT videos from the tab?,https://www.quora.com//Is-it-good-to-take-BYJUs-CAT-videos-from-the-tab,"CAT Preparation 2016, CAT (Common Admission Test) 2016, BYJU'S (company), CAT Preparation, Free Products, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",7,"Permit me to paste a relevant portion of my content that I used in answering another question on Quora - Can anyone provide review about CAT Classes? Short answer - No, it isn't worth.Not-so-short answer - Don't buy it. Unless someone really concerned about you, is ready to make you a really generous donation. But if someone really wants to throw away money, there are better ways to indulge in philanthropy and gifting you a Think & Learn tablet, in my opinion is not one of those ways.The long answer follows.Opinion on Byju's Think & LearnAt the outset, let me say that it is very debatable as to whether Byju Raveendran really is a 'serial CAT topper' or not. While Byju and Santosh might be individually brilliant, their brilliance need not necessarily translate to excellence in their methods.I had a friend of mine who enrolled. I borrowed his tablet and realized, that while QA and DI might be reasonably good, the so called ""mathematical approach to solving RC"" questions is sham. As would toppers who have scored in excess of 99%ile would tell you, there is no real substitute to practice. It however must be said that the ""Membean"" tool for vocabulary building is fairly helpful.Secondly, I realized that the content provided in the tablet meant for CAT'15, was no doubt recorded - But it went back to a few years, when the class was conducted in 2012, in some auditorium. Should you decide to call the local Byju's office, as my friend did, they would say that the content is ""up-to-date""Thirdly, people with high IQ levels, and members of the Byju's Think & Learn team might argue, that topics in Logical Reasoning need no practice and therefore is EXCLUDED as a separate topic, it was evident that the video topics titled ""DI & LR"" were largely DI focused. So do not be really surprised if this is the case.Fourthly, most of their methods are 'option driven'. Given that CAT'15 had a significant number of non-MCQ questions, adopting the ""eliminating the wrong option and taking a calculated guess"" based approach, wouldn't really work in one's favor. Of course, wrongly entering an answer for a TITA question does not entirely become a loss making proposition, as you do not lose marks.Lastly, if you are keen to go with the online-medium of instruction, please explore other options. For anyone - Student or a working professional, 25,000 INR or whatever the fees be, is a substantial amount for an online course. Please take a very guided decision.Updating the answer based on the feedback from a friend - My friend wanted to re-take the CAT after a near dismal performance in 2015. Following the hype around Byju's he pays using the credit card and gets the tablet, after being told that he has the freedom to return the product if found unsatisfactory.The following were his observations.1. The tablet was dusty, and clearly used2. Videos, as explained above were old3. When he goes back asking them for a refund, he is told that the refund will be processed via a cheque/direct-deposit. Agreed, this is not something to crib about. But why wouldn't a company which apparently has ""revolutionized CAT coaching"" with turnover to the tune of several hundred crores have a problem processing a simple refund to the original source of payment? Why make a sincere effort to turn things cumbersome?","Byju’s CAT videos are worth than any coaching center. The CAT preparation module is designed by the experts comprising of the comprehensive study material along with All India test series to master the techniques to crack the CAT Exam in the minimum time. For CAT you require shortcut techniques and strategies, that are best taught in the videos. And yes, Byju’s provide you with free trial classes, so there is nothing funny with the product. You can try and buy only if you feel that the content is worth it. In addition to the tablet, you also have one to one mentoring sessions that help you analyse your performance. For more information, visit the link : CAT Preparation | Best CAT Coaching Institute in India | Byjus.com",Unfortunately I am unfamiliar with Byju's CAT coaching. If you do a google search for Byju CAT classes video and click on the video link you'll find a bunch of coaching vids. Why don't you go through those videos and see if you find the teaching style helpful.In my humble opinion 25k for a bunch of videos is not worth it when you get similar stuff for free online (unless you find the intellectual connect really strong).,Both online and classroom learning have their own advantages.In case of online you can access it whenever you find free time. And if you are very towards mobile/tab/pc then you will find it very interesting.Some people find classroom teaching is effective as it can create the sense of competitiveness.Again it depends on which mode you are comfortable with.Hope this helps.
CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
CAT,"I will finish my B.Tech degree in May 2017. I want to opt for the CAT and other MBA entrance exams. When is the best time to prepare for the same and also what is the best method for preparation, self-study or online coaching?",https://www.quora.com//I-will-finish-my-B-Tech-degree-in-May-2017-I-want-to-opt-for-the-CAT-and-other-MBA-entrance-exams-When-is-the-best-time-to-prepare-for-the-same-and-also-what-is-the-best-method-for-preparation-self-study-or-online-coaching,"MBA Entrance Exams, GATE Coaching, Exam Strategy Advice, CAT Coaching, Graduate School Admission Tests and Exams, Graduate School Admissions Advice, Master of Business Administration Degree Advice, Coaching Exams and Tests, CAT Preparation, Exam Strategies, Graduate School Admissions, Exam and Test Advice, Common Admission Test (CAT), Master of Business Administration Degrees, Exam and Test Preparation, Exams and Tests, Personal Question",8,I think I am one of the right persons to answer this question as I went through the same situation one year back.See there is no hard and fast rule or some well defined strategy for the preparation time and preparation method.I personally know some individuals who didn’t even prepare for one month and still managed to score 90+ percentile. Cat is all about aptitude unlike other entrance exams like GATE OR IES where knowledge also matters a lot.But yes one thing I can assure you that if you start preparing before a year from the date of examination you would be able to do more practice and will be able to grasp the concepts pretty well.I started preparing for cat2015 in july 2015 after my btech and didn’t take any coaching.I used to study for atleast 5 hours a day and fortunately got 97 percentile.So whatever be the way i.e self study or coaching you have to understand the concepts if you think you have sufficient amount of self motivation you can go for self preparation as well like i did.And since you have one year for the preparation you should practice as much as you can.So better start today than tomorrow.Good luck :),"Frankly speaking, the earlier you start preparation, the better it is always.

I’ll try to answer them most objectively.Best time to start preparation : As early as possible. Ideally 6–8 months is a safe bet, but < 6 is okay as long as you are willing to put extra efforts. The key being consistency over the period of your preparation.Best method of preparation Self Study/ Online Coaching : Nothing can beat self study. Even if you enroll for coaching in any mode, make it a point to note that 75–80% of your preparation has to be self study. Cat is one of those exams which tests your aptitude and logical skills, so rest assured you have to build those skills mostly on your own. Having said this, I feel online coaching is something which gives you a head start into your preparation. Moreover, it helps you in familiarizing the concepts & approaches which essentially is required during the initial stages of your preparation. Also, the peer effect is something which titillates your sense of competition. If you looking for a comprehensive online preparation module, I would recommend you the visit iQuanta - Online CAT Coaching for MBA. They are offering the best online coaching in the market at a very inexpensive price. Do visit their facebook group Log into Facebook | Facebook, scores of problems are discussed 24X7 with never seen before approaches by their mentors.Happy Learning!","I would you give you the most detailed review of Iquanta and you decide yourself whether It is right for you or not. Going anonymous for obvious reasonsIndrajeet Singh uses Facebook as a free platform to run Iquanta where He has made three separate secret groups each for QA, VARC and LRDI. Students are added in the respective group according to the course they pay for. Full Course fee is around 14k. Classes or I should say FB posts session is conducted from 10 pm to 12 am from Mon - Sat.The strange thing is that for Rs. 14k you will only get FB posts. No study material. Indrajeet himself recommends that apart from iquanta you have to buy books (Sarvesh Sharma etc.), study material and Mocks of TIME / CL etc. Then why one should pay for his copy paste sessions.Obviously for these mocks and books you have to pay separately.Coming to QA, Classes are taken by Indrajeet himself. What he does is copy paste theory plus questions from other sources on internet or from his creativity and post it in the group just like a normal FB post. Nearly 100 people comment on that post writing answers and doubts. In that you have to find his comment where he gives solution and answer. Please dont expect him to reply 50 people in the comment section to solve their doubts. The intelligent people gives answers quickly and he is happy and moves on to further posts. This goes on for 2 hours. DONT EXPECT VIDEO TUTURIALS ETC. Coming to Live sessions which he boasts of, It comes only once or twice in a month or two as and when required for doubt clearing. Everything else is done in FB posts. Normally 15 questions are done in class and 10 given for assignment. Apart from that you have to do on your own.Above image is a sample class screenshot. Now you decide yourself whether you can study like this or not.Moving ahead to LRDI, Classes are taken by Talha Khan, He posts a LRDI set containing multiple images which you cant see all at the same time because in FB you can see only 1 image at a time. So ques understanding and analysing becomes difficult. Then after 10 mins a youtube video is uploaded for that question in which he has already prepared solution beforehand and expects students to do the same when they see the question first time. I dont understand how do you expect students to solve such difficult problems when they cant see whole question in one place and just traversing through images. No doubt clearing session is there for LRDI. Questions and Solutions are posted and they call it a day.lastly if we talk about VARC, Classes are taken by Rudra Singh, In which 800 words passage is posted as a post followed by 5 longs questions with 5 options as well. Now I dont think any normal person can solve that by looking at a mobile and traversing the screen up and down. This is the approach which iquanta says is unique. Same goes with Parajumble and other type of questions.Now coming to main FB closed group - CAT PREPARATION - IQAUNTA, that is a very good platform which is free for all. Students post their doubts and other people try to help them.Since this group is run by Indrajeet himself he makes sure no body defames iquanta. He blocks that person and deletes his post. I have seen several people's comments who demanded refund as they expected a better course but they were blocked and refused for refund.Dont go for these one sided reviews which he posts on main group so that other people also enroll in his classes.P.S. - To all those people who will be asking me who gave me authority to write such things, I would like to say that I was a student of Iquanta enrolled for full course. I studied in his fb sessions and trust me there is not a single trick he has told which is not there in any book.Now take your decision wisely. Good Luck"

All The Best!!!","I assume you to be a person who would be taking CAT for the first time in 2016. Before you begin with your preparations you need to understand the exam. CAT has 3 sections, QA VA and DI/LR. Most of the top-B schools have sectional cut-offs. Many people make the mistake of solving QA for the whole year and when the results are out either VA or DI/LR score makes them realize their mistake. I do not want you to be on that end so the first effective strategy is to realize that all sections have equal weightage and thus, your preparations should also have equal time devoted to each section. Since you still have nearly 8 months for the exam devoting two hours a day on weekdays and 4-5 hours on weekends are more than sufficient for CAT preparation.  Since most of the VA section consists of RC, do make sure that you take out at least 30 minutes daily to read. It will not only help you in RCs but also help you improve your vocabulary and grammar.For basics of QA and DI/LR you can try any recommended book or opt for an online course such as the one by Handa Ka Funda. Check it here: Online CAT Coaching Classes – MBA 2016 .

CAT,MBA Preparation: What are the ways to improve data interpretation for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//MBA-Preparation-What-are-the-ways-to-improve-data-interpretation-for-CAT,"CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Master of Business Administration Degrees",27,"Thanks for the A2A.I’ll quickly summarize the best tips that I have used myself countless times below:Choices - use the options! In no other section are the 4 given options as valuable as in DI. There are a few tricks to using the choices correctly, but 4 out of 5 times you can dramatically shorten your time to the correct answer by using the choicesQuick approximations - your practice in making fast mental approximations and calculations will pay off in spades in this section. If you develop the skill to glance at the numbers and roughly get a sense of where the totals or percentages should lie, you will be miles ahead. In fact, I believe this skill to be so important that I have devoted a number of video lessons exclusively to it in my online course at ExamVictorLonger answer below:Data Interpretation can be interpreted as a series of processes through which you analyse data, visual and / or numeric and arrive at an INFORMED SOLUTION to the question posed. This section is not a test of your numerical ability or reasoning skills; it is a test of your interpretative aptitude.What is Data Interpretation?Interpretation can be defined as the action of explaining the meaning of something. In your professional life, you will encounter a lot of data which can be in the form of tables, charts and even text. Regardless of your area of specialization, the ability to interpret data efficiently will always be an asset. Hence, management schools look for candidates with an understanding and flair for interpreting data.This section covers the following topics:The DI section tests your aptitude to interpret a lot of data, usually represented in a graphical format, and find answers to the questions based on the data. An important point to remember:Data Interpretation questions DO NOT test your speed of calculations but the speed with which you can calculate quick approximations.Familiarity and understanding of various charts and tables is a prerequisite for this section.Before you begin your preparation…There is a simple rule of thumb when it comes to preparing for aptitude based exams.Test your skills before you start preparingAnalyze the results to identify areas of strength and weaknessBased on the analysis, create a study planLearn and practice – a lotRe-test and assess the improvement in your performanceRepeatWe all have a natural flair to interpret certain data and diagrams. Identifying them can help you focus on your weaker areas and further strengthen your skills. This can be done with or without the assistance of a coaching class. However, I always recommend a guided effort since the experience and expertise of a mentor is usually the difference between an excellent and a good CAT score.ExamVictor, an online coaching institute that I help run, offers an Online CAT course to guide students in their preparation for CAT. We have a team of experienced and qualified faculty with hundreds of high-quality video lessons, thousands of practice questions, live doubt sessions and a mock test series based on the CAT pattern. You can look at some demo DI video lectures by clicking the links below:Data Interpretation requires an aptitudinal approach and not an academic one. Focus on understanding the basics of various kinds of data. This knowledge will not merely help you with CAT but will also come handy in your professional life.Good Luck!","The best way is to be done with all the questions of previous years of CAT from 2000 to 2008. Be familiar with all the types of questions that have come or may some in the actual CAT exam.The first thing that you should do is to be done with the generic books of this section. I hope you are done with the ARUN SHARMA books. You should devote initial two months in understanding all the topics. Start practicing the mathematics topics that will help you in all the data interpretation questions.IMPROVE YOUR CALCULATIONImproving your calculations is the first step to improve your Data Interpretation. You need to work on both accuracy and speed to improve this section. Speed can be increased by practicing regularly. Vedic mathematics can also help you to increase you speed. It is not necessary to follow Vedic mathematics if you are not comfortable with it. To improve your speed try doing calculations in your mind rather than using pencil/pen. In the starting it would take some time to do calculations in mind, but slowly and gradually you will see a mark difference in your speed.The good thing about DI section is that It is tough for every aspirant alike. An attempt of 5 case lets i.e. 20 questions with a minimum accuracy percentage of 80% will definitely land you on the 95+ percentile window. You should aim for attempting 3 case lets as soon as you look through the papers. Remember the most important thing in CAT exam is selecting the easy questions to attempt first. And then go gradually for more sets that you think you can tackle.Taking sectional tests in DI-LR section is the most fruitful thing for improving score here. Go through each topics in a sequential manner and then sit for the mocks. Check how you performed and attempt the questions.You can find beneficial MOCKS on DI-LR HERE.For more CAT test series, you may go through the FOLLOWING LINK.Recent trends in DI questions in CAT suggests that Logic based sets are the most probable type of question that you will face on the D-Day. Solving past 8-10 years papers with full analysis is of utmost importance. As these will help you understand what is generally expected from you.Some of the generic type of questions that you may come across on CAT are as follows:Calculation Based: These are sets with questions which deal with percentage increase/decrease or nominal increase/decrease. They require a good control over basic calculation and approximation.Example: Which is the year in which ABC Ltd. has witnessed the highest percentage growth over the previous year?Counting Based: These are generally large data sets in which aspirants are supposed to count the instances which meet the questions’ needs. They require patience and focus to ensure that not a single mistake happens.Example: How many states (from the data given) have male literacy rate more than 80%, and female literacy rate less than 75%?Logic Based: Sometimes charts prefer to give you data in ranges or with conditions where it’s not possible to find the exact data. But one can surely be asked to find a number which can be arrived at if there is a need of maximizing or minimizing the number.Example: Maximum how many of the employees of the range 35 to 45 years would be above 40 years if average age of employees of this age group is 42 years?Structure Based: These include some specials sets. Example: Goals of various teams in a tournament, sales-disposal data of a particular product in market etc. Such sets used to be no surprise in era of 2004 to 2008. Share of such sets have reduced since the CAT has gone online.Don’t leave even a single type of questions untouched. From tables to pie-charts to everything. You don’t know what is gonna help you on the actual CAT. If you are struck on a certain question, look for it online or on the books that you are following. Apart from ARUN SHARMA books you can also go for DI-LR book by NISHIT K. SINHA.Groups discussions also help in the preparation. Just be sure you are not wasting your time there. There is a discussion group that you might find beneficial HERE.Just don’t leave a single stone un-turned. Take it as the last and most crucial thing that you have to handle for your life and future.

Try to analyze the data given in pie-charts / bar-graphs, etc.b) Try to improve your calculations. This can be done by learning basic multiplication tables to advanced techniques of approximations.c) Most important : Before solving any DI question, have a look at the options. The difference in the magnitude of options will tell you 'how much you can approximate'. This single thing will save you a lot of time and frustration during the exam and while preparing for it."
CAT,Why don't teachers teaching at coaching institutes (CAT coaching for example) take the CAT and get a high package from a top B-school?,https://www.quora.com//Why-dont-teachers-teaching-at-coaching-institutes-CAT-coaching-for-example-take-the-CAT-and-get-a-high-package-from-a-top-B-school,"CAT Coaching, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT)",6,"Why Ramakant Achrekar (Sachin Tendulkar’s Coach) didn’t score more than 100 centuries and 60000 runs in international cricket?Teaching and scoring in the exam are 2 completely different things. Though there are several MBA coaches who take CAT every year and score good enough to get calls from all the IIM’s. I personally know 2–3 of them.But they just take the exam to keep in touch will the latest pattern and test themselves. They don’t want to join any college. They are happy where they are.Many students also join these institutes as teaches after 1–2 years of preparation ( If they dont go through and still want to prepare), so that they are in touch with the preparation. Once they get admission to their desired college, they leave.So it works both ways.","I teach quants at a reputed CAT coaching in Mumbai. We all teach because of passion (if not for all) and the perks associated with this job. Would you like to listen to a harsh truth? The fact that there are tons of students graduating every year from colleges makes coaching a very profitable business . Almost every student is compelled or gets enlightened to study further. Now, for most students this would either mean a MS or MBA. The latter is considered a 'safer' option . I see some students taking classes only to get those fat packages that MBA offers. Little do they know about the work they are going to do after an MBA. So taking an undue advantage of this , most people are successful in running their coaching business. Yes, it is just business for us, nothing more. New year,new faces,new hopes only to know later they are doing what everyone is doing since ages. I would definitely respect someone with a PhD teaching than a MBA doing it here.The only MBA's doing MBA work here is the sales team. They participate in all the education fairs where they apply their marketing skills. The people are smart nowadays,ask relevant questions quite often making the sales team uncomfortable in these education talks.PS: It's a rat race. And yeah, coaching does help you ;)","Higher packages!Let's say that average fees is 42000 ( some people pay 50+ some 40+ and some are here for 2nd time so they pay 15+)Number of students - atleast 250And honestly, 250 is the minimum.250* 42000 = 1,05,00,000 per annum.Now because this place has only 250 students, let's say it has 2 centersRent, paper, water, electricity , salary of receptionist, and all bills can't exceed 25 lakhs per annum.So we get 80 lakhs.Let's say we have 3 teachers for these 250 students.Own business, flexible, minimum approx 27 lakhs per annum.What else do you even need?","Why invest 20 Lacs and then take a package of 20 lpa when you are already earning more than that, plus working independently?While this may not be true for all the teachers of coaching institutes, it is definitely true for some of them. With 3–4 years of teaching experience nowadays the institutes pay 6 digits figure to the deserved persons. Even the starting salaries of the teachers hired by reputable coaching institutes are very good. And do not even talk about earning from if they are motivated enough to open their own institutes. A successful institute owner’s salary can put to shame even the most successful bankers."
CAT,How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?,https://www.quora.com//How-did-99+-percentilers-prepare-for-CAT,"Prepathon, Exam and Test Results, Common Admission Test Percentiles, Percentile, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",100+,"My authority on the subject? I scored a 99.75 percentile in CAT, 99.55 in XAT, 99.45 in SNAP. This is a walkthrough of my preparation/ how you can go about preparing for CAT and other entrance exams.CAT is considered to be one of the most difficult entrance exams in India, but it is isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most of the topics that are tested in CAT are High school level topics. The difficulty lies in the fear of the test. Most CAT aspirants resign to an assumption that they can’t score above a certain percentile without even knowing what the test is made off, half the game is lost at this point.I have been guilty of the same myself. Jan 2016, I remember looking at lists of MBA colleges and immediately rejecting the top 30 odd colleges for the fact that they all required you to score above 97 percentile or so to realistically make into those colleges. It was only when I talked to my father and he explained to me the negativity in my thinking, that I realised, I hadn’t even seen what CAT consisted of. I had no logic in leaving out the possibility of scoring an extremely high percentile.Another reason why I felt that I had to score an extremely high percentile were my 12th class marks. MBA colleges give weightage to academic profile. A self-analysis made me realise that having a low score in my 12th class (69%) was a huge handicap. If I had got a low percentile I would’ve found it extremely difficult to make into the colleges of the relevant level. I would’ve ended up in colleges ranked even lower. I had to score a 99+ percentile. BELIEVE you can Crack the CATHow to go about:I have divided the preparation for CAT into four parts:Pre-preparation, Preparation, Practice, Taking the CATPre-PreparationThere are a few things you’ll want to have in place before you start your preparation for CAT and other exams.Find three hours a day (not in bits and pieces here and there) three continuous hours to prepare. This can be extremely difficult if you are working/ attending college. This might help you to find a few extra hours a day.Get rid of any distractions that you believe affect your concentration or mental state in general. (social media is one of the biggest time-suck and tends to distract you even if you aren’t online)Get in touch with someone who has cracked the entrance exam or has some expertise in the same, you could approach a local coaching centre. (you may not enrol as a full-time student but you would want to be in touch with the faculty there by buying their material or tests etc.) This will be helpful in getting certain finner tips and in case you have difficulties.Get yourself a campaign manager. Cracking the CAT and getting an admission into an MBA college is a long drawn process. You are bound to lose interest or forget important things/ deadlines. Get someone who will keep track of the same. For me, it was my father who helped me keep track of my preparation and all the college applications. Make sure the person you chose exactly understands the process and understands what you want. They will make sure that you are still going even when the motivation starts to run out.Read a lot. This is extremely important when it comes to the verbal ability section of CAT. You will need a lot of broad-based readings and an ability to make sense of what you have read quickly. The passages for reading comprehension in CAT are sometimes extremely abstract and can be extremely difficult to make sense if you aren’t used to reading a lot. Places where you should want to read from: Medium, The guardian, Businessweek Bloomberg, Also read some classic novels that you can lay your hands on, the books talked about on crash course literature are a good place to start.PreparationCAT is divided into 3 sections verbal ability reading comprehension, logical reasoning data interpretation, and quantitative ability. Each of the sections requires equal effort and attention.Time for preparation: There are many people and sites who will tell you that you need 14 hours a day to prepare for CAT. Trust me that doesn’t work. You just need 3 to 4 hours a day consistently over a period of 3- 4 months to crack CAT. Anything more than 5 hours a day can and will burn you out.Source material for preparation: A common mistake that most aspirants will make is relying on just one book/ one source for preparation (particularly anyone who takes coaching). It is recommended that you have access to at least some material from different authors. This will provide you with multiple points of view for the same problems. (same goes for mock tests recommended that take at least 4 to 5 tests from A differen source).Verbal Ability & Reading ComprehensionThis is one of the most frustrating sections in CAT. The question often can seem to have multiple solutions and where options are provided all of them seem correct. Even if you are extremely good with English you can end up messing this section.The key to cracking this section (particularly Verbal ability part) is understanding that this section is more about logic than language. You have to understand the logic as to how the solutions are arrived at (jumbled para is the killer in this section).I initially worked this section by looking at the solutions, that way I was able to see what patterns to look out for and what logic to apply.Work on improving your ability to comprehend complex /long sentences, particularly from topics that you aren’t used to and having complex vocabulary.This section will take a lot of practice to master, more practice than the other two sections. This section has the highest returns for scores. If you get a slightly higher score in this section your percentile can increase drastically. (I scored a 99.98 percentile in this section).Even if you have a good command over the language DO NOT take this section lightly, I know of aspirants who have the CAT along with me having excellent command over the language yet messing up this section completely.Data interpretation and logical reasoningData interpretation is a practice intensive section. There is nothing new that you have to learn in this section. It is just the ability to carry out basic calculations using tools you already have (percentages, averages, summation, division). Practice these basic tools thoroughly so that you are extremely comfortable with them. Also get acquainted with all the various forms of data presentation, such as graphs, pie charts, tables, caselets etc.Logical reasoning is a section which you should and can make the most out of it. The questions are very often similar. While practising logical reasoning the things you would want to learn is gauging the difficulty of the question quickly. If a question is difficult, move on to the next one (time is important).You would want to practice visualising the problem (in mind / on paper ) in the simplest way possible. This will help you breakdown huge paragraphs full of seemingly meaningless words into sensible data.Learn to have an unbiased mind. One of the mistakes you can make in this section is assume somehting that isnt true. Learn to use all the information provided and only than make any conclusion.Read the data carefully a single word can change the whole situation. (for ex. XYZ is not wearing a black pant. can easily be mistaken for XYZ wearing a pant if you miss out on the not.)Quantitative abilityThis is one of the more easier sections to get by, You just have to understand the concepts behind all the topics involved. Again the topics in this section are high school level math. You can over prepare for this section and most aspirants do.There are certain topics in this section that you would want to be extremely thorough with since they appear most frequently (going by the trends of past so many years), such as time speed distance, time work, Geometry, Functions.You would want to also be thorough with averages alligations, percentages ratios since these topics are more helpful in DI section but very rarely make an appearance as stand-alone questions in QA section.Number systems personally I felt for me was an extremely overrated topic ( I spent way more time than required here)PracticeTaking mock tests, I feel mock tests will be the most important part of your preparation as they help you guage exactly where you stand. (another benefit is to know which colleges you should apply to).What is a good number of mock tests to take? There isn’t any concensus on this topic, there are CAT toppers who got by on hardly any mock tests, and than there are people like me who took close 40 mock tests.Personally mock tests where the biggest source of practice for me. I took mock tests from 3 different sources. ( I recommend atleast 2 different sources). Once you have taken a mock test it’s extremely important that you analyse them well, I spent about an hour and half after every mock test to analyse where I have gone wrong and what can be changed. Mock tests are also a good time to test out strategies in handling various sections. (I will try to come with a detailed post about analysing mock tests.)I will boast a little here, but thanks to the trends on my mock tests I was extremely confident of getting the percentile I got on CAT. ( I expected at least a 99.5 %le)I recommend practicing during the time slot you will actually be answering the CAT, I had to take the CAT on a sunday in the morning slot (9.30 to 12.30) at a centre 30 kms away from home. Considering the reporting time of an extra hour, I would have to technically leave my house at 7 in the morning on the day of the test. I usually get hungry within 2 and half hours of eating anything. So in the month before CAT I trained my body, by having breakfast at 6 in the morning and not having anything till 1pm. I also trained myself to sit at one place for 4 hours (830 to 1230). This may seem funny/ unnecessary but on the day of the test you dont want to have any other factors troubling you.Taking the CATTry to stop preparation for CAT at least 3 days before CAT (there are people who will disagree and reccommend you remain in the mood and keep preparing) anything you try to “prepare” during these last days often will be of very little help. Don’t wander away from the CAT mood though, read or at least make sure you are sitting 3 hours at a place for these last few days ( to stay in the CAT mood).Do not take a mock test in the few days before CAT, If you mess the mock it is likely that you will panic on the day of the CAT.Do not keep any expectations as to the number of questions you want to complete in each section.All the best for your preparation for CAT.P.S. CAT isn’t everything, CAT is hardly a learning experience, you won’t learn anything new as such (well other than how to prepare hard) it’s mostly about things you already know, taking the CAT can hence be a very frustrating experience. I recommend that you learn something else too on the side lines, get a hobby or hold a job (again debatable as to how much time you can find etc.) If you are taking drop read a lot, read all the books you can get your hands on. All in all try to do something else too that will help you grow.Belling the CAT and other entrance exams","This answer is fairly long, about 7000 words. So I have divided my answer into 9 parts wherein each part can be read independently. However reading the entire answer in one go will serve as RC practice, so that would be advisable.What I have mentioned below helped me in my journey from 66% -> 99.85% in CAT. I have tried my level best to be as detailed as possible. GK as a section is not there in CAT as of now but is very important in the other papers like XAT, IIFT, SNAP, etc. So, I have included that as well. I have also put in a little bit about how to attempt mocks and then analyse them to improve further. A little bit on GD-PI-WAT as well, so that this answer serves all your needs.I would like to point out that I have been an average student all my life and am a GEM (General Engineer Male), yes pun intended. My 10/12/B.Tech scores are 83/79/66. With that I made it to IIM Calcutta, so the first thing that you should now do is stop worrying about your previous grades. 99% of the people reading this will surely have better grades. So, if I can you obviously can get through and study at an IIM.My CAT 2015 score card:QA: 99.8%LRDI: 99.96%VA: 87.33%OA: 99.85%This answer is divided into the following parts:A.) How to start?B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityC.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningD.) VA -> Verbal AbilityE.) GK -> General KnowledgeF.) How to attempt mocks? (Non-CAT exams at the end)G.) How to analyse mocks?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?I.) GD-PI-WAT prepA.) How to start CAT prep?Register at any site which lets you attempt and review a mock for free. You could try hitbullseye. If you have already enrolled for a test series or for a classroom programme, then attempt one of their mocks. Many of you would be like bhai abhi toh padhai start bhi nahi ki, mock deke kya hoga aur upar se aadhe questions toh samajh bhi nahi aayenge aur maths ke formula bhi yaad nahi hain. Additionally while attempting the mock, there will be multiple instances when you will feel like getting up because you are not used to solving questions for 3 hours at a stretch. Your brain will also try to deceive you into grabbing your smart phone for checking Whatsapp. You will feel like drinking water, you will also be tempted to check FB. The point of this test is to make sure that all this doesn’t happen when you actually attempt CAT. Now you would be thinking what is the point in attempting a mock when I don’t know $hi+.Precisely my point! The main reason for this mock was to identify what you know, what you don’t, where you stand and how much hard work is required.Once you are done with the mock, check the solutions and find the topics which you already know, which you attempted correctly. Some problems would have been there which you would have been sure of but you got them wrong because you were out of touch and forgot the formula or recalled an incorrect formula. You probably forgot the plural of fish. Fish or fishes? Or does it depend on whether I am talking about a species of fish or multiple units of the same species? Then you will realise that a little brush up of a few topics (which you are out of touch with) will dramatically improve your score. Work on these topics first and then move on to topics which you have no clue about. This mock decides your future course of study.Now, on to the preparation phase.B.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityStart off with this site. http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/Click on start and then check your score. You know where you stand. Keep practising a few times every day and your score will keep improving. If you can hit 50-55 consistently in the default 120 seconds, you will easily hit 99.5% in CAT in this section. If you are targeting 99.5+ then I would also like you to memorise the following:B1.) Reciprocals, Squares and Cubes up till 30. Pay attention here, some values will get repeated. As for 1/7. Remember that it is .142857. For other go up to 2-3 decimals,whatever you are comfortable with. I would prefer 3 decimals though.B2.) Power of 2 up till 12Power of 3 up till 8Power of 4 up till 6Power of 5-6 up till 5Power of 7-10 up till 4Power of 11-13 up till 3Again same as above. Some values will be the same. 4^6 has already been covered till 2^12 and so on. Don’t just mug up blindly, pay attention to the numbers.B3.) Square Root up till 10B4.) Factorial up till 10B1-B4: Now most of you would be like, dude they give an inbuilt calculator. But then other exams don’t have that calculator. Additionally who do you think will take lesser time in solving a question? A person who uses the calculator for finding 12^3 or someone who just knows it is 1728. Believe me when I say that this is very important for your LRDI section as well. This will decide whether you get stuck at 99.5% or go beyond that. This is the deciding factor. Please memorise these values.B5.) A few important numbers like 999=27*37, 1001=7*11*13, 21^3=9261.B6.) Some numbers have the property wherein the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the no itself. 1, 2, 145 and 40585. Please remember these.B7.) There are 15 primes till 50, 25 till 100, 46 till 200 and 168 till 1000.B8.) How to find the sum of the first n natural nos. Sum of squares of n natural nos. Sum of cubes, sum of 4th powers. Please remember the formulas. Specially the last one (fourth power), most people forget that.B9.) Scale is not allowed in any of the exams. What the CAT authorities mean is that the scale which we used back in school that is not allowed. They never said anything about using your hand as a scale. Check the length of your fingers. Also check the length of the 3 sub division on your fingers. Use your right or left hand, whatever suits you. Please make sure that you remember these values by heart. These values will help you solve 90% of the geometry questions. Also, buy a protractor and make sure you can make the angles 30, 45, 60, 90 properly. First with the protractor and then without it. Based on the question, make a rough figure. Then based on your lengths, find the answer and then scale up to the value given in the question. Geometry has a lot of formulas, memorize them or use this approach. Approximation ftw!B.10.) Unitary Method. Make sure you are good with this, half the QA syllabus can be solved using unitary method. Do you think whatever has been mentioned in B9 is basically Unitary Method at the end for getting the answer?Most of the students go for solving the maximum no of problems. Don’t do that. Focus on the basics, don't go for solving questions directly like most students. Most students don’t score 99+. You are different, work differently. This is how you should be doing it for any given chapter day wise. First day go after the formulas and try to understand why a certain formula is there. Make sure that you have memorised all the formulas for that chapter. If you were to set the paper, what could be a possible question? Read a formula, try to frame questions on that formula and then memorize the formula. Just memorizing all formulas in one go won't help, because you will probably forget. If you can do this, then you would have solved all the questions by the time you finish reading the theory.Example: Let's say you are studying Numbers. You see the formulas for HCF and LCM of 2 nos. Then you see the factors of a number. Now think of possible questions on this. Let's say 72.1.) How many odd factors are there?2.) How many even factors are there?3.) What is the sum of the odd factors?4.) What is the sum of the even factors?5.) What is the product of the odd factors?6.) What is the product of the even factors?7.) How many factors are squares of natural numbers?8.) How many factors are cubes of natural numbers?Good going, you just completed half the chapter! Similarly think of more questions that you can make. The exercise at the end is filled with such questions. It depends on your thinking. Focus on this. If basics are fine,questions won't be a problem.Would you memorize 456*876 and 235*9865 and things like that or learn how multiplication works?If you think that you lack imagination when it comes to maths and can’t do the above, then no problem. As mentioned above, by the end of the first day you would be done with memorising all the formulas. That’s it. Don’t solve anything. Just make sure all the formulas are deeply rooted in your brain and you can recall them anytime you want. Now take a break for a day. On the 3rd day, start solving problems. But remember that you are to solve by recalling the formula not by turning over the pages and looking at the formula. If you cannot recall, then please make sure you memorize the formulas again. Solve a few problems. Take a day’s break and continue solving on the 5th and similarly on the 7th day as well. This way apart from the formula getting imprinted in your brain multiple times, you will also understand which formulas are asked more often than others. Some chapters are connected to one another. Make groups of such chapters. If working on a group, try to complete all the topics in that group. For example:Ratio Proportion, Unitary Method, Percentage, Profit and Loss.Simple equations, Simultaneous equations, Inequalities, Time speed distance and work, Quadratic.Progression.Numbers, Bases, Miscellaneous equations.Surds and Indices, Logarithms.Mensuration.Geometry.Coordinate Geometry.Probability and PnC.Functions and Graphs.For people trying to clear the cut off in this section. The first 3 with mensuration and a bit of geometry/numbers will be enough.C.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningData Interpretation is speed and practise. The site mentioned in the Quant region and B1-B4 there would be of immense help. These will increase your speed. Generally each and every DI set has at least a problem on percentage or ratio.Today when you start, start off with the sole intention of solving all the questions of a given set. When you can do that on a daily basis. Move to 2 sets a day. When you can do that. Move to 3 sets daily and then to 4 sets. Keep solving as many questions as you can. Time taken per question will decrease with practise. A few months after you were born, you started to crawl, then you started walking and finally you started running. Same thing here. Don’t think about speed now. Speed comes gradually. Let nature take its course.Logical Reasoning, as the name suggests is based on how well you can interpret and analyse things. LR checks your thought process, it checks how you tackle problems. Get this book ""Puzzles"" by George J. Summers. When you watch a football match, why do you watch it? Probably because you want your team to win or you want to see a good contest and enjoy. Similarly, once you have bought this book, think about your objective. It’s not about getting the correct solution, it’s about improving your thought process. And additionally the puzzles in this book are tough. You could think of it as the daddy of Irodov. Engineers will get the joke! You won’t be able to solve most of the problems and frankly speaking I don’t expect you to. However, what I do expect from you is to read a question. Try to understand what has been given. Try to understand what is being asked. Think about it for say 10-15 minutes. Write down whatever approach you can think of. If you could not solve it, look at the hints and their solution scheme. Were you thinking in the right direction?Analyse the difference between the method given in the book and your method.Try to understand what you missed because of which you could not solve the puzzle. Try again for 30 minutes. If you can solve it, good enough, if not maybe try again. After a few more tries look at the solution. Remember you bought the book to improve your thought process, not to solve each question in the first attempt. Trying a puzzle for 5 minutes and then looking at the solution will take you nowhere. Solving again and again till the time you get the answer is what the book was bought for. To make sure that you can think and get the answer on your own. The answer at the end is just for verification. 1-2 puzzles a day. 3 at max, not more than that. You have to improve your thought process,not complete the book as fast as possible. Your scores in the LR section will improve in a month’s time and then it will stay at 99%.Another very important point would be to memorize the alphabet-number conversion table. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. You will come across questions on this in your mocks as well as in the exams.D.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI had 69 and 72 in English in 10 and 12 respectively. My verbal score in CAT went up from 43 -> 87%. Whatever I have written below is what I did to make sure that I cleared the verbal cut off comfortably. If you are looking at a 99+verbal score, then you would be better off by reading the other answers to this question for improving your verbal section. This part is not for you kindly move on to the LRDI section. If you however $uck at English just like me, then this just might help you in clearing the sectional cut off. I tried memorizing words from the GRE word list. My language skills were not good enough to use words like persiflage, perspicuous, ubiquitous, scintillating, etc. in sentences. So, I would keep memorizing and then keep forgetting these words. I had never read novels so I had never come across such words as well. So, I came to the conclusion that memorising words won’t help me. But, a decent vocabulary is needed for CAT. So, I bought this book “Word Power Made Easy” by Normal Lewis. Managed to complete the chapters in a few months. I didn’t do the word list at the end. I would request you to buy this book and complete the chapters.Another thing that seemed obvious to me was that whether you look at RCs or Para Jumbles or Para Completion or Para Summary. All these have basically been written by some person who had a very good command over the English language. So all these things should logically have a flow of thought with which the author would have written the entire thing. You just have to understand that flow. If you can understand an RC, then understanding a paragraph from that RC will obviously be very easy for you. Think about it, a PJ or a PC or a PS are basically paragraphs taken from an RC. You just have to understand the flow in which the entire thing was written by some person who had a decent understanding of the English language. But, then I again had a problem. The Verbal section in CAT was supposed to be of 1 hour and as soon as I would start reading an RC, 8-10 minutes down the line I would feel drowsy. I would start thinking about checking FB or Whatsapp or practically doing anything apart from reading that stupid RC. All those Speed reading techniques, skimming, reading the question first and all. None of that mattered. I understood what my problem was. COMPREHENSION and CONCENTRATION. By the time I was in the 2nd para I would have forgotten what was written in the 1st para. It’s called a READING COMPREHENSION for a reason. Never trade comprehension for speed.How to improve comprehension and concentration?Both will improve gradually with time. First step is to make sure that you don’t feel drowsy when reading for an hour. You will be required to do that in the exam. So you need to build your stamina to concentrate. Start off by reading 2-3k word long articles on News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian. Register on the website and you will get a mail every morning at 10am. Read all the articles from there. Make sure you read at a stretch for an hour. Read everything from Culture to Technology to Art to Literature. In the beginning you will feel sleepy within a few minutes of starting. Slowly you will gain rhythm. Within 15 days you will be able to read 1 hour at a stretch. In a month’s time you will start retaining information as well. Then focus on just 1 category every day. Like only Philosophy or only Art or only culture. With that your stamina and concentration will increase further and since you are reading about only 1 thing for 1 hour, your knowledge in that topic will also increase. This can be done at home, but preferably in office to better utilize your time. PJ PC PS are all extensions of an RC. All will seem easy once you are comfortable with RCs. Here News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian you will be reading 2000-3000 word long articles. Once you are used to this, 500-600 word passages in CAT and other exams will be a piece of cake for you!For verbal, always eliminate choices and then mark rather than directly trying to find the correct answer. This section is different from the other sections,so it has to be dealt in a different manner. Please eliminate choices and then answer. If in doubt, leave. As for the grammar section, I have no idea when to use have and when to use has. Same with is/are and things like that. Neither can I spot grammatical errors in sentences. So, I mostly leave such questions.But I always read them. You can always answer a few of them based on instinct. Some sitters are always there in every paper.E.) GK -> General KnowledgeAll the papers except CAT have this section. Some have a sectional cut off,some don’t. This section can be answered in about 5 minutes. It has the highest marks/min for any section. This section is the key to a high percentile. This section will give you the points for speaking in a GD and PI and also for writing in WAT. So, if you plan on getting through to a good B-School don’t ignore it. There would be 2 methods to prepare for this.E1.) Start reading any newspaper. Go through the headlines and all. Make sure you are updated with what is happening in the country. After a week or so, you will realise that it’s mostly the same thing that keeps getting repeated everyday in the paper. Think of it from the point of view of the exam. There will be MCQs. So they won’t ask for your opinion on Kejriwal vs Modi. Leave all the pages on politics. That’s sheer wastage of time. Don’t waste time on that stuff! Make sure you remember the schemes which Mr Modi keeps rolling out. At least remember the important ones. Did any big firm buy another one? Any Indian who won some award abroad. Who won which Grand Slam? Who won the Pulitzer Prize? Who won the Arjuna Khel Ratna Award? India is working on the Chabahar port with which country? Malcom Turnbull is from which country? I think you would have understood what is expected from you. MBA is about business. Focus on economic and business news more than others. Noble Prize in economics fort his year? How many Deputy Governors are there in the Reserve Bank? Make a doc file with these details. You file would look somewhat like this.https://docs.google.com/document...This is what I had made for this year, so no this won’t help you! You will have to make one with the current affairs of this year. Since you will be working the entire year making this, so by the time the exams are a week away, you will have such a file. You might however think that this is too much work. In that case I would suggest you try the second and relatively easier method compared to this.E2.) Whichever is the first exam for you which will have a GK section, keep 4 days before that exam for making this file and memorizing it. Gather all the monthly booklets which are given to Time students. Each book has about 100 questions. Memorize the ones you think are important. CL and Time both will also have a few sheets on GK, current affairs, etc. Get those as well. CL GK compendium. Hitbullseye gk pdfs are also there. You can get most of these online for free or search on Pagalguy, someone would have uploaded it there for sure. Whatever you think is important, please memorize that. 4 days is more than enough to complete all the material I have mentioned above. By going through the monthly magazines you will also be able to keep track of what is happening in India and also round the globe.The regular reading (The first method, reading daily) means that when the exam sare about to start, you would have completed most of the things. The last 4 days will serve as a revision for you. I did both the above things. So if you have time go for it. A close friend of mine, Prateek, he was preparing for UPSC. He was of immense help! Whenever I would meet him, we would talk about how things going on in our country. Served as revision for him and I would stay updated with facts. So, if you can find someone who is preparing for UPSC religiously,i t would be great. You will also have a contact who is an IAS officer. If you want to score even higher in GK get a small yearbook from some shop. Small ones general contain 100 odd pages, going through that will serve as revision as well.F.) How to attempt mocks (Non-CAT exams at the end)The first step here is to make sure that you can sit and concentrate properly for 3 hours at a stretch. FB, Whatsapp, drowsiness, drinking water or the sudden urge to go to the washroom during these 3 hours have to be removed.Kindly take care of such things which might disturb you, especially the last 2 and then start a mock. When you are attempting the mock, the only thing in your mind should be about maximising your score! Another point that you should keep in mind in that no one cares about what you know and what you don’t. The only thing that matters is your score. So please keep your ego aside when attempting the paper. Yeh question kaise nahi bana, kal hi toh banaya tha and then you spend the next 15 mins on it and still end up marking the wrong answer. Please don’t! You have a fight with your girlfriend and then you are like “I am not texting her first”. Yes I was talking about that very ego of yours, please get rid of it when you are attempting a mock. If you can’t solve a question then please move on to the next one. The examination hall is not the place to derive a formula and then solve the concerned problem. Anyways, I could go on but I think I have made my point.Remember that half the paper is very easy, mostly formula based. Your approach should be to attempt these questions first. Make sure that you have touched the 97-98% mark and then move on to the difficult questions for improving your score.F1.) QA -> Quantitative AbilityYou are not supposed to start from question no 1 and then continue till 34. Most of the times you will not even be able to look at some of the problems in the end. So we will follow a Round by round approach. About 50% of the problems are direct formula based. When you start this section (Round 1), keep the above point in mind. So, as soon as you look at a question. Can you solve it in a minute by using a formula? If the question with a formula was given to a 5th grader, would he be able to solve it. If yes, then solve this question. Use the values given in the question, get the answer and then move on to the next question. If you see a question and you are like, yaar yeh toh banaya hua hai, 2-3 min lagega, lamba question hai. Or if you are like sirf cases likhne hain, phir count kar lunga, phir answer. Such questions which you know you can solve but are not direct formula based, are to be left out now. These have to be attempted in the 2nd round. Getting my point? If formula based, then attempt else next. Within 30 minutes you should have attempted about 16-17 questions and you would have seen all the questions. That will get you at least 97-98% in this section.Now Round 2, there were a few questions which you had seen earlier and were pretty confident about. This is where your brain will help you. The human mind is so awesome that even though you just looked at it once but solved different questions and totally forgot about it, you brain was working on that question subconsciously without you having any idea about it. Now, when you read the question, you will take a lesser amount of time to solve it compared to what you would have taken had you solved it in the first round itself. You could go for Round 3 as well, your choice! But 2 rounds are needed. Please stop with a single round method which most of you are used to now.Why this approach?Many people are most often not able to see the entire paper,so they miss sitters. This round by round technique helps you go through the entire paper and thereby select the easiest ones which in turn maximises your score. You won’t get a prize if you solve a question that only 10 students out of 2 lac could solve. The marks per question is the same. Since you solve the easier problems first, the chances of your committing mistakes goes down considerably. A question which you have solved but incorrectly is not wasted time and only a -1 for your score. Instead of 3 you get a -1. So such a question effectively hits you with lost time and a -4. This method reduces the no of such questions. Hence, this approach.F2.) DILR -> Data Interpretation and Logical ReasoningIf you have tried solving the book which I had mentioned above, you would by now have a fair idea about how to make a table for solving LR problems. 5 people, 5 countries, 5 cars, 5 pets. All of us have solved such puzzles,haven’t we? You would obviously have 4 columns but which would be the first and which would be the second, etc. That determines how fast you will be able to solve the set. Oh, you thought it didn’t make a difference? It does! Sometimes you are better off soling set theory problems by a table. This is where your practise and experience comes into play. Making the proper table means half the work is done then and there. You just have to put in the values and tick mark the correct answers now.Now about how to attempt. When you start the section, go through the 4 LR sets.1-2 sets will be very easy. Take a couple of minutes and try to identify the easier ones. Look at the questions. Do you see any question wherein it asks how many cases are possible or questions of that sort? Such sets are to be solved at the end. Look for sets wherein directly by looking at the questions, you know that there is one unique solution. Use the answer options to further reduce your time for soling that set. Now start with such sets. First advantage of this method will be that you will feel good, because you will be done with a couple of sets in 10-12 minutes. Additionally you will be in a flow and your chances of cracking a difficult set will go up. Now compare this to the case when you start the section, and think that looking at all the questions means losing a few minutes. I am James Bond, so I will start with the first set. 10 minutes later you haven’t completed a single question and now for the remaining 50 minutes you will keep thinking, yaar 10 min faaltu mein barbaad ho gaye. Good luck solving that section and the next with such a mind-set.Many a time it will happen that the set you picked up, is going nowhere and yet time is passing on. For such sets, wherein you have already spent 4-5 minutes but haven’t been able to mark even a single question. Please leave that set.You might be tempted to think sirf 2 min aur, aur phir 4 questions ban jayenge. Please don’t commit that mistake. 5 minutes is the threshold in which you should have been able to mark at least 2 questions. Worst case scenario 1. If you are at 0. Please move on. You are better off solving that set later on,preferably at home!Same with DI sets, go through the sets, select the easier ones, and complete them. You will be left off with 2 sets. Again with 2 options, it always easy to select the easier one. This way most of the times, you will end up solving the toughest set at the end or you will probably leave it. All questions have the same marks, so isn’t it better to solve easier ones? Additionally tougher problems will also take a toll on your brain, your effectiveness for the next section might go down. Do you want that to happen?Sometimes a set will be easy but a question in there will be extremely tough.Beware of such questions, these are put in place to derail your momentum. 5-7 minutes per set is what you should be looking at. Always look at the questions and attempt. You don’t have to attempt all questions from a set. Even 3 attempts for a set is fine. Again, you know the term that I am talking about!Keep that aside when attempting a mock.F3.) VA -> Verbal AbilityI get tired of reading and lose interest quickly. So RCs at the end seems a bad idea. So, I start off with RCs. Again as soon as you start this section. Glance through all the RCs in a minute and check if any of them is from a subject you like. Your reading speed and comprehension will be higher in this case. Again as mentioned above, just because you read an RC, doesn’t mean you have to attempt all the questions. Even 4 out of 6 questions from an RC is good enough. Just attempting for the sake of increasing attempts is sheer stupidity. Please don’t think ki aree yaar itne marks toh already aa hi rahe hain exam mein. Dusron ko thoda mauka de deta hun -2 leke. Please don’t do that. Eliminate options and then attempt. When in doubt leave. Move on to the single questions after the RCs.Note -> For non-CAT mocks which you attempt online.First and foremost thing is that apart from CAT, most are pen paper based, but at home you attempt online papers for these. Take a few print outs of the OMR sheet and check how many minutes you need for marking the answers. Keep a 5 min buffer for your safety. Let’s say we talk about IIFT. It’s a 2 hour paper in real. However I need 20 minutes just for marking the bubbles. So, there is absolutely no point in attempting the online paper at home for 2 hrs. Submit the test after 100 minutes. Don’t worry if people attempt for 2 hours and your rank is low. Your score in the main exam matters, not in this one. Similarly for SNAP and XAT as well. Form a basic strategy of how you would like to attempt the paper for the 100 minutes(whatever your time is after you have checked marking in the OMR sheet). Like for Snap, I had a strategy of 5-6 minutes for gk then 16-18 minutes for verbal, then 35-40 minutes for LR. Then maths and as soon as it would be 90 minutes after the start, I would mark all the answers. Then solve and again mark in the last 5 minutes. Similarly make your strategy for IIFT, SNAP, XAT, etc. and stick to it.G.) How to analyse mock?The instant you submit a mock, you will have a score in mind, itna toh banta hai. 1 sec later the page reloads and you see your score and you go, are yaar itne toh 2 section milake hi aa jane chahiye the. This is why analysing the mock is important. You knew a certain score was achievable but your score went down drastically because of silly mistakes. Analysing mocks will take care of such mistakes. Once the solutions and result for a mock are out. First of all check up all the problems which you couldn’t solve. That’s what you have to learn.Then look at the time taken by the topper in solving a question. Look at your time. Did you take 200 seconds whereas the topper took 30 seconds? That’s because there is a technique you don’t about. Learn that technique. Write it in your notebook where you write formulas. That was about identifying and learning things which the toppers know. You have to be one of them. Go through the mocks and find such methods. AdditionallyThen there will be a category of questions you were sure of but you somehow used your talent and got it wrong and after looking at the solution you are like aree yaar yeh koi kaise galat kar sakta hai. But as a matter of fact, you did! This will happen mostly in counting problems (Numbers). Even if you had 100 in English in 10 and 12 you will still come to know that you had been using some Grammar rule incorrectly or there is some exception you had no clue about. But, after a -4 you will remember them! You will sometimes come to know that a certain word which you have been using all your life can also be used in a totally different context. Thank You without an exclamation mark? Sarcasm! Oxymoron, alliteration, etc. Learn what these mean. Such mistakes will make sure you remember all these. Sometimes you will take the diameter as the radius and solve. Sometimes 2*3 will become 5 and sometimes 7*19 will become 114. Don’t rush through problems. The paper is set so as to give you enough time. Slow and steady wins the race.Then another section in the results shows the % of people who attempted a question and % of people who got it right. You are supposed to attempt the easy ones first, then the average difficulty questions. Finally attempt a few difficult ones or totally leave them out. Here you can check which questions you were supposed to attempt but didn’t. Also the questions which you were supposed to leave but being the Bond that you are, you nonetheless decided to attempt it thereby losing marks and giving others a chance to overtake you. If your family is worth billions of dollars, you could do that, but given that you are still reading this, I doubt it! So whenever you look at such questions, try to think about what was in your mind during the mock which made you do such a thing. Try not to commit the same mistake again.Yes, I agree all this will take more than 3 hours. Who told you getting into a good B-school was easy?H.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?The study material from the top 3 institutes namely Time, CL and IMS is mostly the same. I have seen and used it, so use whichever you want, it won’t make a big difference. A few new ones like Hitbullseye and test funda are also coming up. Haven’t used the material by these 2 so can’t comment. In terms of content the level of questions is higher in Time. I mean tougher questions here, so you are better prepared for CAT, but then you could also argue about why put in more effort than required. In CL, the theory and explanations for quant is way better that that in others. Theory for quant is literally non-existent in Time. IMS is good for verbal. As mentioned above, please use that book for LR and also that book for Verbal. I have not mentioned the names of the books, because if you scroll up and check you will then remember the name when you have to tell it to the shopkeeper! That LR book will help make a strong base for you and then completing the LR material from these institutes will give you practise and improve your skills further. For those who keep talking about Arun Sharma, please please please use proper material. Do you really think 1 book is good enough for your CAT preparation and others are stupid who go through all that? If you think you are smart enough and don’t need all that and 1 book is enough. Good Luck with CAT!Mocks basically tell you where you stand when compared to the toppers in the country. Time has the most no of people attempting its Aimcats. So having that is a must. Next in line, with the maximum no of people attempting the mocks would be CL. After that you have IMS, test funda and all. Aimcats are pretty tough when compared to actual CAT but are extremely important because it gives you a true picture of where you stand and how much more effort you need to put in. CL mocks are close to the CAT level especially in terms of quant. IMS mocks are close to CAT level in verbal. I would suggest Time + CL/IMS. You can however take all the 3 if you want. Or maybe some other institute’s mock series. It’s mostly about practise.The mock questions are mostly the same. It’s just the values that they keep changing every year. Same with the material. Whether you look at the material of this year or that of 5 years ago, you will realise that it’s mostly the same. So, you are better off buying old material from someone or from a secondhand book store. I have uploaded some mocks and some prep material. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...https://drive.google.com/open?id...I also found some useful material from total gadha. Here’s the link for thathttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...I.) GD-PI-WAT prepFrankly speaking, getting a score is easy. This is the tougher part. This requires more hard work because in here, you will be up against the best in the country. Most of the people attending the interviews will come prepared, so here your odds will be higher. So, please work hard for this. GDPI prep as such should be dealt with in a different question. So, won’t go into the details here, but just an over view of what is expected of you. If you had done the GK and current affairs part as mentioned above, you will be easily able to manage the WAT. You will also have ample of points for speaking in a GD. Similarly questions on current affairs in a PI will also be a piece of cake for you. What remains is the HR part. In here, you have to understand that you can guide the interview and you can force them to ask exactly what you have prepared. But that requires a little thinking. Tell me about yourself is a standard question which is used to initiate an interview. It is mostly followed by your strengths and weaknesses. The main thing here is that you have to try to make a story and link everything that you have done in your life till now with why you want to do an MBA. The interviewers are smart people, they have been doing this for years. They are extremely good at catching liars. So think this through well. This part of your prep needs your utmost dedication and hard work. Prepare your answers properly. It is really tough to explain how to prepare for GD-PI. You will be better off at some institute where someone can guide you individually. However, what I can still do is upload all the GDPI material that I have and share it with you. But do keep one thing in mind, this contains some files on the current affairs of 2015, so that will be of no use for you. The other stuff is pretty much relevant. Here’s the link for that.https://drive.google.com/open?id...I hope you convert your dream college. May the force be with you!","How ‘NOT’ To prepare for CAT/GMATOne of the most important strategy in CAT/GMAT is to find out the wrong choices to identify the right one. This post is dedicated to “Avoiding Mistakes” strategy.Myth & Mistake-1: Following the Herd. Choosing a help or any coaching because others are choosing itHumans belongs to Animal kingdom. If you have studied Biology, then this point will be easier to understand. In animal kingdom. Weak animals are always in herd but the strong one is solitary or always having small groups. Ever wondered Why??The answer lies in the mentality. A strong animal judges the situation and leads its life based on its experience but a weak animal actions are based upon others. If others are doing it, then it’s wise to do it. You can choose to be a Herd follower or to make your own paths.Never follow the group. A leader never follows. If you will move with a group, you will always be with them. If you will create your paths, then only you can beat others. Adding following lines from Robert Frost to add a dramatic touch:“Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”Myth & Mistake-2: Focusing on absolute number of Successful Candidates rather than Percentage.Most of the Institutes talks about the number of success stories but are silent on how many of their students were unsuccessful. Even their Advertisements talks about total number of students getting Interview call or final admits. But the real numbers are shocking, most of the Institutes have 2-3 % students getting expected result.But the magic is in numbers. Make people follow a Herd and even if 2-3% students are successful, the success numbers become substantial. The problem is that your chances of landing in the unsuccessful students group is 98%, but this data does not bother them because they know how to work upon the “Herd Mentality” of the population. Show them 2% success stories and make them follow a herd.Myth & Mistake-3: The Bigger the Better.I am referring to Class Strength. No teacher can teach a herd. If your batch size is more than 10-12 students, then you are not getting proper attention from a teacher. If the education company is claiming “Customized or Personalized” services, then the class size must be less than 10-12 students.Myth & Mistake-4: Going after a Brand or No.1 education companyAll Branded books are easily available in the market at very low-cost. A student joins any help or coaching to get a personalized teaching experience. A Teacher-Student relation is analogous to a Mother-Child relation. There is nothing called “No. 1 Mother”. Every mother is No. 1 for her Kids and the reason is her personalized attention.Rather than sitting in a large group with “No. 1”, you should aim for a personalized attention (We join any help for their teachers or their course offering).Myth & Mistake-5: Deciding after taking DemosAll Institutes stage their Demos. They are very carefully planned. The teacher is usually the teacher, who will not teach regularly. If anyone says “Book your demo” or guide you to a specific time, then it is staged. The best way is to ask them about their class timings and insist on sitting in the ongoing class. If you feel the focus is on you, then you are at the wrong place.Try to identify honest institutes. Honesty should be a very important deciding factor.Myth & Mistake-6: Choosing Institute which makes “Toppers” or just focuses on “Past Records”Never choose any institute if its marketing is focused on this fundamental. Keep your basics simple. Think what you want from it and focus on its delivery. You are there for education, not to hear its past stories.Institutes focus on this factor to take your attention away from their product. Your focus should only be on their product, their teachers, their teaching methodologies, their course structures, etc.Myth & Mistake-7: Jo Dikhta hai, Wo (Nahi) Bikta haiA good product needs no marketing. Weak products need marketing. Whenever you see lots of marketing effort, Google ads, ATL or BTL, it proves that the product is weak. Strong product does not need for all these advertisements. In the marketing world, out of 4Ps, the product is supreme. Focus on “Product”.Myth & Mistake-8: Marketing Gimmick-CAT/GMAT Toppers as TeachersThis is the most commonly used marketing tool, which has a flawed assumption. Now I am talking more of “Critical Reasoning” language. The flawed assumption is “All Toppers are good Teachers”. Teaching needs a very different skill set. The teaching is to impart knowledge; all toppers cannot be good teachers and all good teachers cannot be toppers.Myth & Mistake-9: Institutes offering Patented Techniques or “Tips & Tricks”All tests require “Hard Work”. If someone can patent “Hard-work”, then this “Gimmick” should be accepted. “Tips & Tricks” are developed with your hard-work. Shortcuts should be evolved and should never be learnt from someone else. Particularly for CAT/GMAT, which is more of an IQ test, “Techniques, Tips & Tricks” should be evolved.Myth & Mistake-10: CAT/GMAT will take me to HarvardThis point is more applicable to business schools taking GMAT as a screening tool.The student’s full profile will work. The CAT/GMAT is a one small part of the profile. Look at all business schools as a family, no family will allow you to be their part till the time they see their values or virtues in you. Every Business school has a distinct positioning and your profile should be positioned in the same way. Profile building is the main work and every person should concentrate on.Myth & Mistake-11: Adopting Toppers StrategiesHear everyone, but adopt none. Every person develops his own ways depending upon his Strengths & Weaknesses or as per his conditions. Good for someone may not be good for you. Hear everyone, but adopt only wisely.Myth & Mistake-12: Practice-More the merrierPractice Better, Not More. The practice should have a direction, running in circles will not help. Do Tests and review. Keep error Logs and keep on practicing. Practice wisely, so that every time you move, you should learn from your past mistakes. Do not overdo the tests.Myth & Mistake-13: Teachers will make me a TopperTeachers show us directions. Unless you practice the topics taught in the class, it will not work. I saw many students thinking that if they spend more time in classes, it will help.Myth & Mistake-14: All tests just needs lot of studying, no need to focus on healthHealthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. I see many students not focusing on their health during exams. Many of the studious people have unhealthy bodies. You need to balance life with at least 7-8 hours’ sleep.Myth & Mistake-15: I do not need any peer groupYou learn more from peers than the teachers. The most important factor will be jealousy. Competition in the group brings the best out of you. I was very fortunate that all others in my group were good. They have already scored more than 700 in prep tests. Every test was like a world war where every one of us wanted to beat everyone else in the group.Myth & Mistake-16: I will study and practice from lot of free materials on netBeware of free materials. There is no free lunch. Some free materials are good, but most of it is crap. The real test is different from the Free tests you see on the net. You will be caught off-guard if you are preparing from the net material.Myth & Mistake-17: Beware from 30-day toppers, 15-day toppersThis is the most common way of advertisement. Become a topper in 30 days or 15 days. It’s hilarious. This is a perfect example of fraud marketing. The CAT/GMAT is an IQ test. Only Asterix magic potion can do it and nothing else.Myth & Mistake-18: You can deceive GMAT Computer Adaptive AlgorithmPlease do not try. GMAC has evolved a test which cannot be deceived. Every question can carry you “Up” and throw you “Down”. Each question is important and has the same value as others do.One more myth is when a student believes that difficult questions carry more marks. And easy questions weightage is low. Do not read too much into any strategy. Work hard and it will show.One more mistake is trying to gauge your performance by counting correct questions out of total. This is the reason why the GMAC computer algorithm is difficult to copy.If you see easy questions, you are not doomed. It does not necessarily mean that your test is not going well.Myth & Mistake-19: Quantitative is important, Engineers have an advantageEngineers do not have any advantage in this test. Rather, they are at a disadvantage because their strength (Quant.) does not have substantial weightage. I have seen many students crossing 700 with 40 in quant and Q40 can be achieved by more than 80% of the test givers.Myth & Mistake-20: I am good in English, verbal will be kids playVerbal is not English, verbal is all about IQ. The only portion of the grammar it touches is SC. But the way CAT/GMAT tests your grammar is more based on IQ rather than grammar rules. SC is more about identifying the wrong choices rather than the correct one. It depends upon how easily you can see 2-3 splits and apply logic to find the correct answer.In CAT/GMAT, there is no perfect answer, you must mark the “Most” correct answer. There might not be any perfect answer in the five choices.Your choices should be based on your experience and how a help will help you cover your shortcomings. I found EduShastra customized approach much better than others.

CAT,How was the CAT 2018?,https://www.quora.com//How-was-the-CAT-2018,"Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018, CAT Preparation, Common Admission Test (CAT), Exams and Tests",46,"Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.Original Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.But the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.Quant was relentlessThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar toAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?Wherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.First principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.VARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easierVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.DILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.Percentile Ranges - ExpectedKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following rangesVARC - similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 73+99th percentile – 6697th percentile – 6094th percentile – 5490th percentile – 5080th percentile – 40DILR - Also similar to CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 52+99th percentile – 4297th percentile – 3794th percentile – 3090th percentile – 2480th percentile – 20Quant - a step above what was seen in CAT 201799.5th percentile plus - 54+99th percentile – 4397th percentile – 3894th percentile – 3590th percentile – 2980th percentile – 23Overall for CAT 201899.5th percentile plus - 160+99th percentile – 14097th percentile – 12794th percentile – 11590th percentile – 10080th percentile – 75Once again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.Best wishes for the results, folks.","Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam AnalysisThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines. 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well. 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading ComprehensionQuestion Structure Reading Comprehension: 24 questions 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)  Parajumbles: 4 questions Odd one out: 3 questions Summary: 3 questionsAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions. Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.So, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.Summary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data InterpretationQuestion Structure There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.A total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.As far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced. In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016. In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017. If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.Summary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative AptitudeQuestion Structure Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it. Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions. There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).A total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.Summary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.Expected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 ExamTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questionsFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam To get 90%ile 35-37 questions To get 95%ile 42-44 questions To get 98%ile 48-50 questions To get 99%ile 53-55 questionsWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping","2nd Attempt | Afternoon Session | GEM (95/89.4/8.71)I will tell you a little about me before I start off my experience of writing CAT 2018. I have trouble getting sleep on the very exam day. This happened with me for the first time on the JEE Main 2013 day when I couldn’t sleep at all. And this haunted me for the second time 5 years later on the CAT 2017 day. I could manage to sleep for merely 3.5-4 hours that day. I knew I had lost it even before the exam started and that’s what happened. The only saving grace was Quant where I managed to score really well (34A/33C).So, I started preparing again. I started working since June 2018 and my job is immensely hectic – all Saturdays are working and sometimes I have to work on Sundays too. But that’s OK, I never had to study Quant, it was all VARC and DILR for me. However, I couldn’t pull myself up well in VARC till the exam, barely clearing the 85-percentile cutoff in a few mocks.I had always been apprehensive about my sleep throughout the year and the anxiety grew as exam came nearer. I had given sectionals even at those times when I would yawn at around 11 in the night after a hectic workday. I gave IMS Pre-CAT when I could manage to sleep for 5 hours. I also gave SIMCAT 16 near my actual CAT Center when I could surprisingly sleep for 7.5 hours in order to reduce anxiety. I scored 203 in it. That day is one of the most memorable days of this year for me.25th November. I sleep at 12:30 a.m. I get sleep at 1:15 a.m. I wake at around 2:15 a.m. After roughly an hour of turning sides, I get sleep at 3:15 a.m. I wake up at 6:15 a.m. And that’s it. But this time, I knew I am not going to fuck up because of my sleep. I went out to run, came back, had a bath, solved 4 DILR sets and left for the centre.I got to know that Quant had been the toughest in the morning slot. I felt I could have an advantage over others in this so I was happy. I was all boosted up and I thought I am going to nail it. Reached the place. Got all the formalities done. Went to the washroom two times. Drank water and I sat on my seat. 15 minutes before CAT, I start yawning badly. But I was unfazed. I knew that this time I won’t blame sleep to be a reason for my failure.The exam starts. VARC – my weakest section.I took 20 minutes on my 1st RC. 12 minutes on the second one. I was losing it. The only saving grace was that there were 2 passages which I had already read (one from the SIMCATs, another one from Cracku’s) so it took me lesser time to read those. I marked answers for 25 questions (24 from RCs and 1 Summary Question).Next came DILR.I solved the Venn - Diagram set in 10 minutes. I went for the college accreditation set and I fucked up there, losing 10 minutes. I left this set and went for the Interviews one. I solved this and then went for the amusement park set. I solved 2 questions from it, then the smartphone DI set, came back and managed to solve the rest 2 questions of that set. I was left with 2 minutes and I somehow managed to answer 2 questions from the college accreditation set, only to find out that they were incorrect while checking the score.Last came the highlight of this year’s CAT, Quant.I could understand that the questions were really difficult, way hard than last year’s, harder than almost all mocks I had given apart from those of Cracku’s, because of which I could top sometimes even after having a bad VARC. I marked questions which I felt were verbose and from topics like PNC, Probability, pipes and cisterns and felt like solving in the second lap. I managed to mark answers to 27 questions in my first run. Came back and solved 5 questions more and fluked 1 answer.I felt the paper to be really tough. Last year I managed to solve 33 questions in 40 minutes and so I got time to check as well. But this time, I couldn’t complete my paper fully, let alone checking it.So, I attempted 76 Questions in total. I was very happy that day. The first thing I did while I got out was telling my mother about how I fared. I thought sleep couldn't defeat me this time. I went to a Mall straight from the centre that day. It was my first visit to any mall in Mumbai since I started my job. I had lots of food, ice-cream and I even made a donation to UNICEF there. I was very happy.Well, my happiness didn’t last long. If only these IIMC guys could post their shit a little later.VerdictVARC 31 (25A/14C)DILR 44 (18A/15C)QA 83 (33A/28C)Damn. I failed again. I really wish to clear the VARC sectional percentile this time because otherwise, it is Game Over. It is disheartening to know that I got 3 questions wrong in the RC in which I invested 20 minutes. The fact that I got questions wrong in QA which is my forte is another reason.And yes, I won’t blame lack of sleep to be a reason for my pathetic score in VARC in any sort because it was not. I literally suck in it.Considering my situation now, I wish to get at least 1-2 calls so that I at least get a chance to prepare for the interviews. Just like preparing for CAT has improved me in its own ways, preparing for interviews will help me in improving my speaking, communication skills and more.Let’s hope for the best. All the best to you too.","CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!25th November:This was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.Section 1: VARCVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.Section 2: DILRThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.Section 3: QAThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.I went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.30th November:IIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various key in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.7th December:IIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!"
